Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/"
  get:
    summary: Search
    parameters:
      - name: type
        in: query
        description: Return movie or series
        type: string
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            Search:
              type: array
              items:
                Type:
                  type: string
                  example: movie


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.type == return.Type

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StringEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two String scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "Search" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 1413 examples in the requests data, with 2 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 2 example values of the variables:
input.type=movie; return.Search.Type=movie
input.type=series; return.Search.Type=series

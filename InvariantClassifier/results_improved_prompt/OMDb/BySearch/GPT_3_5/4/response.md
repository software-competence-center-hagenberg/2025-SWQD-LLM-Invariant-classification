## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides a GET endpoint with a response schema containing a property 'Search' which is an array of objects.
- Each object in the 'Search' array has a property 'Poster' of type string, with an example value of a URL.

## Invariant
- The invariant is that the field 'return.Search.Poster' is always a URL.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and found 86638 examples in the requests data, with 1349 distinct examples.
- All 86638 examples of 'return.Search.Poster' are URLs, and we did not find a single counterexample.
- The example values provided also confirm that 'return.Search.Poster' always contains URLs.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any other possible values for 'return.Search.Poster', and the examples are consistent with the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, along with the consistency of the examples with the invariant, the verdict is that the invariant is a true-positive.

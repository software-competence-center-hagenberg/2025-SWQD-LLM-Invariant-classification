## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to the path "/" with a query parameter "y" of type integer.
- The response schema includes a "Search" array containing objects with the properties: Title, Year, imdbID, Type, and Poster.

## Invariant
- The invariant is: input.y > size(return.Search[])
- This means that the value of the query parameter "y" is expected to be greater than the size of the "Search" array in the response.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- There are 1034 examples in the requests data, with 546 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show values of input.y and return.Search that support the invariant.
- The invariant makes semantic sense in the context of the API, as it compares the year of release (input.y) with the number of search results returned.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the semantic relevance of the invariant, it is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the response from the GET request to the root path ("/") includes an object with a property named `Episode`, which is of type string. The example provided shows that `Episode` can take the value of "4".

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.Episode` is Numeric, which means that the string representation of `Episode` should only contain numeric characters (0-9).

### Analysis
1. **Type of `Episode`:** The Swagger definition specifies that `Episode` is a string. While the examples provided (8, 7, 9, 17, 2) are numeric values, they are still represented as strings. The invariant suggests that all values of `Episode` must be numeric strings.
2. **Counter Examples:** The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counter example, which strongly supports the claim that `return.Episode` is always numeric in the tested scenarios. However, the definition does not explicitly restrict the values of `Episode` to only numeric strings. The specification allows for any string, and while the examples provided are numeric, it does not guarantee that non-numeric strings cannot be returned in other scenarios.
3. **Potential for Non-Numeric Values:** Since the `Episode` is defined as a string, it could theoretically hold non-numeric values (e.g., "abc", "1a", etc.) in cases not covered by the tested examples. The absence of counter examples does not rule out the possibility of such values being returned in the future or in different contexts.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the value of a variable to numeric strings, while the specification allows for any string, it is likely that the invariant is a false-positive. The invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API, as the specification does not explicitly limit `Episode` to numeric strings only. Therefore, the classification is a **false-positive** with a confidence of 0.85 due to the strong evidence from testing but the potential for other string values.

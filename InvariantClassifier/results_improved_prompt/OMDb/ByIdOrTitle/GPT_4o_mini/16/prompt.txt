Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/"
  get:
    summary: Search
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            seriesID:
              type: string
              example: tt0341939


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.seriesID)==9

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 2653 examples in the requests data, with 10 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.seriesID=tt3032476
output.seriesID=N/A
output.seriesID=tt1190634
output.seriesID=tt0903747
output.seriesID=tt0472954

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/"
  get:
    summary: Search
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            Production:
              type: string
              example: Sony Pictures


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: "return.Production == ""WARNER BROTHERS PICTURES"""

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.OneOfString
Invariant description: Represents String variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 1000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 534 examples in the requests data, with 2 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 2 example values of the variables:
output.Production=WARNER BROTHERS PICTURES
output.Production=N/A

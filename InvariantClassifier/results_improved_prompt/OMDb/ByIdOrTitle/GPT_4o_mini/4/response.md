### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that returns a JSON object containing a property `Ratings`, which is an array of objects. Each object in the `Ratings` array has properties `Source` and `Value`. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that all elements in the `Ratings` array are not null: `return.Ratings[] elements != null`. This means that every object within the `Ratings` array must be a valid object and cannot be null. 

### Analysis
Given that the invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, it strongly suggests that the API consistently returns non-null elements in the `Ratings` array. Additionally, the specification does not indicate that null values are permissible for the elements of the `Ratings` array. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant holds true based on the provided information and the absence of counterexamples. 

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant `return.Ratings[] elements != null` is classified as a **true-positive** because it is supported by the Swagger definition and has been validated through extensive testing without any counterexamples. 

**Verdict**: true-positive  
**Confidence**: 0.95

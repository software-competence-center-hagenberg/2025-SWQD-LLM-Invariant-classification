Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/"
  get:
    summary: Search
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            imdbVotes:
              type: string
              example: 370,080


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.imdbVotes is Numeric

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsNumeric
Invariant description: Indicates that the characters of a string variable are always numeric. Represented as x is Numeric.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 250 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.imdbVotes=7,899
output.imdbVotes=1,889,334
output.imdbVotes=221,005
output.imdbVotes=368,470
output.imdbVotes=71

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the response from the GET request to the root path ("/") will return an object with a property called `Type`, which is of type string. The example provided in the definition is `movie`. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.Type` can only be one of the values: `"episode"`, `"movie"`, or `"series"`. 

### Analysis
- The invariant is based on the observed values from the API responses, which include `episode`, `series`, and `movie`. 
- The fact that 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true for the current implementation of the API. 
- However, the invariant is not explicitly stated in the Swagger definition, which means that while it may hold true based on the observed data, it is not guaranteed by the API's specification. 
- The presence of only three distinct values in the observed data does not contradict the invariant, but it also does not confirm that no other values could be returned in the future or under different circumstances. 

### Conclusion
Given the strong evidence from the number of calls and the observed values, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. However, the lack of explicit mention in the Swagger definition introduces a slight uncertainty. Therefore, I am confident in this classification but acknowledge the potential for future changes in the API that could introduce new values for `Type`. 

Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

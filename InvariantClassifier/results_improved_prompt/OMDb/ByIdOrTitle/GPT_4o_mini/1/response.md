### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies a GET request to the root path ("/") with a query parameter named `i`, which is expected to be a valid IMDb ID in string format. The response for a successful request (HTTP status 200) is an object containing a property `imdbID`, which is also a string representing an IMDb ID.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter `i` (from the request) is equal to the returned `imdbID` (from the response). This can be represented as: `input.i == return.imdbID`.

### Analysis
The invariant is based on the premise that the IMDb ID provided in the request is the same as the one returned in the response. Given that the API is designed to return the IMDb ID that corresponds to the input ID, it is reasonable to expect that these two values would match. 

The fact that there have been 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample strengthens the case for this invariant being a true-positive. Additionally, the 7201 examples of matching input and output further support the consistency of this behavior. 

However, we must consider whether the API could potentially return a different `imdbID` for a given input `i`. The specification does not indicate that the API could return a different ID for the same input, which suggests that the invariant is likely correct. 

### Conclusion
Based on the provided information, the invariant `input.i == return.imdbID` holds true for the API as described in the Swagger definition. There is no indication from the specification that the API would return a different `imdbID` for a given `i`, and the empirical evidence from the calls supports this. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive** with high confidence.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the response for the GET request to the root path ("/") includes a property called `Ratings`, which is an array of objects. Each object in this array has a property `Source`, which is a string. The example provided for `Source` is "Internet Movie Database".

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `Source` field in the response can only take on one of three specific values: "Internet Movie Database", "Metacritic", or "Rotten Tomatoes".

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The response structure allows for `Ratings` to be an array of objects, each containing a `Source` field. This means that multiple `Source` values can exist in a single response.
2. **Distinct Values**: The invariant claims that `Source` can only be one of three specific values. While the examples provided ("Metacritic", "Rotten Tomatoes", and "Internet Movie Database") do match the invariant, the invariant does not account for the possibility of other values being valid unless explicitly stated in the API specification.
3. **Counterexamples**: The fact that 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample suggests that the invariant holds true for the tested cases. However, the specification does not explicitly restrict `Source` to only these three values, which means there could be other valid values that are not accounted for in the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the `Source` field to only three values while the API specification does not explicitly limit it to these values, it is likely that the invariant is a "false-positive". The presence of other potential valid values not covered by the invariant makes it incorrect. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a false-positive with high confidence due to the lack of explicit restrictions in the API specification.

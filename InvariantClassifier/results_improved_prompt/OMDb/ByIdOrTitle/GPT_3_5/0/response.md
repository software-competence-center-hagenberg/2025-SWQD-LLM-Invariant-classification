## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides a GET endpoint with a response schema containing a property 'Ratings' which is an array of objects.
- Each object in the 'Ratings' array has a property 'Source' of type string.
- The example provided for 'Source' is 'Internet Movie Database'.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the 'Source' property in the 'Ratings' array can only take on the values "Internet Movie Database", "Metacritic", or "Rotten Tomatoes".

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the nature of the 'Source' property, it is likely that the invariant holds true. The examples provided cover all the allowed values for the 'Source' property, and the nature of the property suggests that it is a controlled vocabulary with a limited set of allowed values.

## Conclusion
I classify the invariant as a true-positive with a high confidence due to the large number of examples and the nature of the 'Source' property in the response schema.

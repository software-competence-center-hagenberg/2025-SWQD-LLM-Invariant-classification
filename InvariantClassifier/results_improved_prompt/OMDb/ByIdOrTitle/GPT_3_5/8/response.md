## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides a GET endpoint with a response schema containing a property 'Released' of type string.
- The example value for 'Released' is '12 Jun 2013'.

## Invariant
- The invariant is that the length of the 'Released' string in the response is always 11 characters.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 379 of them being distinct examples.
- The example values of the 'Released' variable in the response are '26 Jul 2019', '06 Jun 2009', '30 Sep 1983', '12 Nov 1983', and '10 Jan 2020'.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples found in the requests data.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant LENGTH(return.Released)==11 is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

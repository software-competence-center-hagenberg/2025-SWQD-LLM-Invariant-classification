### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition provided describes a REST API endpoint with a `GET` request at the root path `/`. The response schema for a successful request (HTTP status 200) is an object that includes a property `Poster` of type `string`. The example given for `Poster` is a URL pointing to an image hosted on Amazon's media server.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.Poster is Url`, which asserts that the `Poster` field in the response is always a URL.

### Analysis
1. **Data and Examples**: The invariant is supported by 10,000 API calls without any counterexamples, and 11,650 examples in the request data, with 328 distinct examples. All provided examples of `return.Poster` are URLs.
2. **Swagger Specification**: The Swagger definition specifies `Poster` as a string, with an example that is a URL. While the type is `string`, the example strongly suggests that the intended use is for URLs.
3. **Semantic Context**: The property name `Poster` and the example URL indicate that this field is likely used to store URLs to images, specifically movie posters, which aligns with the invariant.
4. **Lack of Contradictory Evidence**: There is no evidence from the data or the specification that suggests `Poster` could be anything other than a URL.

### Conclusion
Given the large number of examples and the lack of counterexamples, combined with the semantic context and the example provided in the Swagger definition, it is highly likely that the invariant `return.Poster is Url` is a true-positive. The invariant aligns with the intended use of the `Poster` field as suggested by the example and the context of the API.

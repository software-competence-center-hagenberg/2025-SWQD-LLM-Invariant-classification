This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

    summary: Search
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            imdbVotes:
              type: string
              example: 370,080


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.imdbVotes is Numeric

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsNumeric
Invariant description: Indicates that the characters of a string variable are always numeric. Represented as x is Numeric.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 250 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.imdbVotes=7,571
return.imdbVotes=590,057
return.imdbVotes=307
return.imdbVotes=546
return.imdbVotes=1,031

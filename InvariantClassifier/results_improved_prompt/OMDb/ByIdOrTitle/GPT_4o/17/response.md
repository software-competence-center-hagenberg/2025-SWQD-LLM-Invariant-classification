### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition provides a brief overview of the API endpoint:
- **Path**: `/`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Summary**: Search
- **Response Schema**:
  - **Property**: `totalSeasons`
  - **Type**: `string`
  - **Example**: `2`

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that the `totalSeasons` field in the response is always numeric. This is represented as `return.totalSeasons is Numeric`.

### Analysis
- **Response Type**: The `totalSeasons` field is defined as a `string` in the Swagger definition. However, the invariant suggests that this string is always numeric.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 2,894 examples were observed, with 15 distinct values, all of which were numeric.
- **Example Values**: The provided example values (`1`, `2`, `15`, `34`, `12`) are all numeric, supporting the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the empirical evidence from a large number of calls and the nature of the example values, it is highly likely that the `totalSeasons` field, while defined as a string, is intended to represent numeric values. The lack of counterexamples further supports this conclusion. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a "true-positive" with high confidence.

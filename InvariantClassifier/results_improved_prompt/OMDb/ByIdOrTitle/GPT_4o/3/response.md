### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- **Endpoint**: GET /
- **Response Schema**: The response is an object containing a property `Ratings` which is an array of objects. Each object in the array has properties `Source` and `Value`.
- **Response Code**: 200

### Invariant
- **Invariant**: `return.Ratings != null`
- **Invariant Type**: `daikon.inv.unary.scalar.NonZero`
- **Invariant Description**: This invariant suggests that the `Ratings` array in the response is never null.

### Analysis
- **Response Structure**: The `Ratings` field is defined as an array. In JSON, an array can be empty, but it is distinct from being null. The invariant `return.Ratings != null` implies that the `Ratings` array is always present in the response, though it does not necessarily mean it contains elements (it could be empty).
- **Test Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true across various scenarios.
- **Specification**: The Swagger definition does not specify any conditions under which `Ratings` would be null. It is typical for arrays in REST API responses to be present but possibly empty, rather than null, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Conclusion
Given the evidence from extensive testing and the typical behavior of REST APIs to return empty arrays instead of null, the invariant `return.Ratings != null` is likely a true-positive. The Swagger definition does not contradict this invariant, and the absence of counterexamples in 10,000 calls further supports this conclusion.

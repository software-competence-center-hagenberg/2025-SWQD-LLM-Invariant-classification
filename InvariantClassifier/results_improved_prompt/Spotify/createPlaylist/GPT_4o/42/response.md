### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint for creating a playlist on Spotify. The response for a successful creation (HTTP 201) includes a JSON object with at least two properties:
- `href`: A string that provides a link to the Web API endpoint for full details of the playlist.
- `type`: A string that describes the object type, which is 'playlist'.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.type` is a substring of `return.href`.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `href` is a URL pointing to the playlist resource, and the `type` is a string indicating the type of object, which is 'playlist'.
   - It makes semantic sense for the type 'playlist' to appear in the URL, as the URL is specifically for accessing playlist resources.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found.
   - There are 11,650 examples supporting this invariant, with 10,000 distinct examples.
   - All example values provided show that 'playlist' is indeed a substring of the `href`.

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The specification does not explicitly mention any other object type for this endpoint, reinforcing the likelihood that 'playlist' will always be part of the `href`.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic alignment, the lack of counterexamples after extensive testing, and the consistency with the specification, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant logically follows from the structure of the API and the nature of the resource being accessed.

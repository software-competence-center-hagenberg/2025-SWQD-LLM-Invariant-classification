Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

    parameters:

        schema:
          type: object
          properties:

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 10000 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/0D7lhL5Mx9Q7ThZ81rOFl0; return.type=playlist
return.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/3xg0PeP4kXXyqDOl71T8h2; return.type=playlist
return.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/2kbz7Vkl1S2Msow2lkI6SJ; return.type=playlist

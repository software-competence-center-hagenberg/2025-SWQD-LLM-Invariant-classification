### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/users/{user_id}/playlists` with a `POST` method is used to create a playlist. The response body includes a property `external_urls` which contains an object with a `spotify` property of type string. Additionally, there is a `type` property in the response which is described as 'The object type: 'playlist'.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.type` is a substring of `return.external_urls.spotify`. Specifically, it asserts that the string 'playlist' (the value of `return.type`) is always a substring of the URL provided in `return.external_urls.spotify`.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The `return.type` is explicitly defined as 'playlist' in the response. This is a fixed value according to the swagger definition.
2. **URL Structure**: The `return.external_urls.spotify` is a URL pointing to the created playlist on Spotify. The URL structure `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/{playlist_id}` inherently contains the word 'playlist'.
3. **Empirical Evidence**: With 10,000 calls made and no counterexamples found, and 10,000 distinct examples supporting the invariant, the empirical evidence strongly supports the invariant.
4. **Semantic Alignment**: The invariant makes semantic sense because the URL is specifically for a playlist, and the type is 'playlist', which naturally aligns with the URL structure.

### Conclusion
Given the fixed nature of the `return.type` and the consistent structure of the `return.external_urls.spotify`, along with the strong empirical evidence, the invariant is highly likely to be a "true-positive". The invariant logically follows from the API's design and response structure.

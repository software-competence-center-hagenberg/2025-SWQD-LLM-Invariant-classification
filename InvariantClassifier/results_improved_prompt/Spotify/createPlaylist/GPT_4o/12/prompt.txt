Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/users/{user_id}/playlists"
  post:
    description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
    parameters:
    requestBody:
        schema:
          type: object
    responses:
      '201':
        description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            images:
              type: array
              description: The cover art for the album in various sizes, widest first.
              items:
                type: object
                properties:
                  height:
                    description: The image height in pixels. If unknown: null or not returned.
                  url:
                    description: The source URL of the image.
                  width:
                    description: The image width in pixels. If unknown: null or not returned.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.images[] == []

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.sequence.OneOfSequence
Invariant description: Represents long[] variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

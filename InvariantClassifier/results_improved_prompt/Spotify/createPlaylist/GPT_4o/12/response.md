### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/users/{user_id}/playlists` with the `POST` method is designed to create a playlist. The response for a successful creation (HTTP status `201`) includes a JSON object with a property `images`, which is described as an array containing objects with properties `height`, `url`, and `width`. These properties provide details about the cover art for the playlist.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.images[] == []`, which suggests that the `images` array in the response is always empty.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Definition**: The definition indicates that `images` is an array of objects, each potentially containing `height`, `url`, and `width`. However, it does not specify that these objects must always be present or that the array must be populated.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found, meaning that in all tested cases, the `images` array was empty.

3. **Contextual Consideration**: The `images` array is described as containing cover art for the playlist. It is plausible that when a playlist is initially created, it might not have any cover art associated with it, resulting in an empty `images` array.

4. **Specification Ambiguity**: The specification does not explicitly state that the `images` array must be populated upon playlist creation. This leaves room for the invariant to hold true, especially if the default behavior is to have no images initially.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of counterexamples across a significant number of tests and the plausible scenario where a newly created playlist might not have associated images, the invariant `return.images[] == []` appears to be a "true-positive". The specification does not contradict this invariant, and the empirical evidence strongly supports it.

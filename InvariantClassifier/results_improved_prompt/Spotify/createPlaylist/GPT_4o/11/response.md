### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint for creating a playlist on Spotify. The endpoint is a POST request to `/users/{user_id}/playlists`. The response for a successful request (HTTP status code 201) includes a JSON object with a property `images`, which is an array. This array contains objects with properties `height`, `url`, and `width`. The description for `images` indicates that it contains the cover art for the album in various sizes.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.images != null`, which implies that the `images` array in the response is never null.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not explicitly state that `images` can be null. However, it describes `images` as an array of cover art images, which suggests that it is expected to contain data.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests that in practice, the `images` array is consistently non-null.

3. **Semantic Consideration**: The `images` array is meant to represent cover art for the playlist. It makes sense for this array to be non-null, as a playlist typically has associated cover art. However, the specification does not explicitly guarantee this.

4. **Potential Edge Cases**: While the invariant holds for the tested cases, there might be edge cases not covered by the tests, such as playlists without cover art. However, given the large number of tests, such cases seem unlikely.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of explicit specification allowing `images` to be null, the large number of successful tests, and the semantic expectation that playlists have cover art, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant `return.images != null` is a "true-positive". However, the confidence is not absolute due to the lack of explicit specification.

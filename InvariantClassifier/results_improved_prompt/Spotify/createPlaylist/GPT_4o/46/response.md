### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/users/{user_id}/playlists` with a `POST` method is used to create a playlist on Spotify. The response includes a `type` property which is a string indicating the object type, specifically 'playlist', and a `uri` property which is a string representing the Spotify URI of the playlist.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.owner.type is a substring of return.owner.uri`. This means that the `type` field in the response should always be a substring of the `uri` field in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `return.owner.type` is described as 'user' in all examples, and `return.owner.uri` is a Spotify URI that includes the string 'user'. This suggests a consistent pattern where the `type` is indeed a substring of the `uri`.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample. Additionally, there are 11,650 examples supporting this invariant, with 5 distinct examples provided, all of which satisfy the invariant.
3. **Specification Consistency**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly contradict this invariant. The `uri` is expected to contain information about the owner, and it is logical for the `type` ('user') to be part of the `uri`.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic consistency, empirical evidence, and lack of contradiction in the specification, the invariant `return.owner.type is a substring of return.owner.uri` is likely a true-positive. The invariant is supported by a large number of examples and aligns with the expected structure of Spotify URIs.

**Verdict**: True-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

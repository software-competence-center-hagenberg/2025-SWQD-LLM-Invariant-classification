### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint for creating a playlist on Spotify. The endpoint is a POST request to `/users/{user_id}/playlists`. The response for a successful creation (HTTP status code 201) includes a JSON object with a property `external_urls`, which is described as "Known external URLs for this album."

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.external_urls != null`. This invariant suggests that the `external_urls` property in the response is never null.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The Swagger definition specifies that `external_urls` is an object. However, it does not explicitly state whether this object can be null or not. The description "Known external URLs for this album" implies that this field is expected to contain URLs, suggesting it should not be null.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. This high number of calls without a single instance of `external_urls` being null strongly suggests that the invariant holds true in practice.

3. **Semantic Consideration**: The `external_urls` field is likely intended to provide URLs related to the playlist, which are essential for accessing or sharing the playlist. It makes semantic sense for this field to always be present and non-null.

### Conclusion

Given the high number of calls and the semantic expectation that `external_urls` should always contain relevant URLs, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant `return.external_urls != null` is a "true-positive". The lack of counterexamples further supports this conclusion, indicating that the invariant is likely correct for every valid request on the API.

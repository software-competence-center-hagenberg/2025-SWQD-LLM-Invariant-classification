### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an endpoint for creating a playlist on Spotify. The response includes a property `external_urls` which contains a `spotify` URL, and a `type` property which is described as the object type, specifically 'playlist'. However, the invariant in question involves the `return.owner.type` and `return.owner.external_urls.spotify`, which are not explicitly detailed in the provided Swagger excerpt.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.owner.type` is a substring of `return.owner.external_urls.spotify`. The example values show that `return.owner.type` is 'user' and `return.owner.external_urls.spotify` is a URL that includes '/user/' followed by an identifier.

### Analysis
- **Empirical Evidence**: We have 10,000 calls with no counterexamples and 11,650 examples supporting the invariant, with 5 distinct examples.
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `return.owner.external_urls.spotify` URL consistently contains the segment '/user/' which matches the `return.owner.type` value 'user'. This suggests a structural relationship where the type 'user' is embedded within the URL format.
- **Specification Consistency**: Although the Swagger definition does not explicitly mention `return.owner`, the observed data and URL structure imply that the invariant is consistent with the API's behavior.

### Conclusion
Given the high number of examples and the lack of counterexamples, combined with the semantic consistency of the URL structure, it is highly likely that this invariant is a true-positive. The invariant reflects a structural aspect of the Spotify API where user-related URLs include the 'user' type as a substring.

**Verdict**: True-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition provided describes a REST API endpoint for creating a playlist on Spotify. The endpoint is a POST request to `/users/{user_id}/playlists`. The response includes a JSON object with at least two properties:
- `type`: A string that describes the object type, which is 'playlist'.
- `uri`: A string that represents the Spotify URI of the playlist.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.type` is a substring of `return.uri`.

### Analysis
- **Response Structure**: According to the Swagger definition, the `type` field in the response is always the string 'playlist'. The `uri` field is a Spotify URI that includes the type of the object as part of its structure, specifically in the format `spotify:playlist:{id}`.
- **Examples Provided**: The examples given show that the `return.uri` field always starts with `spotify:playlist:`, which includes the substring 'playlist'.
- **Number of Calls and Examples**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 11,650 examples were found, with 10,000 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the structure of Spotify URIs and the consistent pattern observed in the examples, it is reasonable to conclude that the `type` being 'playlist' will always be a substring of the `uri` for playlists. The URI format inherently includes the type of the object, making this invariant a logical and expected outcome.

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a "true-positive" with high confidence.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/users/{user_id}/playlists` with the `POST` method is used to create a playlist on Spotify. The response includes an object with properties such as `external_urls` and `id`. The `external_urls` object contains a `spotify` property, which is a string representing the URL of the playlist on Spotify. The `id` is a string representing the Spotify ID of the playlist.

### Invariant
The invariant in question states that `return.id` is a substring of `return.external_urls.spotify`. This means that the playlist ID should appear within the Spotify URL for the playlist.

### Analysis
- **Empirical Evidence**: We have 10,000 distinct examples from 11,650 total examples, all supporting the invariant without any counterexamples.
- **Semantic Analysis**: The Spotify URL format typically includes the playlist ID as part of the URL path. This is consistent with the examples provided, where the ID appears at the end of the URL after `/playlist/`.
- **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not contradict this invariant. It is reasonable to expect that the playlist ID would be part of the URL, as URLs often include identifiers for resources.

### Conclusion
Given the strong empirical evidence (10,000 distinct examples without counterexamples) and the semantic consistency with typical URL structures, this invariant is very likely a "true-positive". The ID being a substring of the URL aligns with common practices in URL design for resource identification.

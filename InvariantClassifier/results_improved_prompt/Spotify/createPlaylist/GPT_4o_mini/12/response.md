### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a playlist, which returns a response containing an array of images. Each image object can have properties such as height, width, and URL. The invariant in question states that the `return.images[]` is equal to an empty array (`[]`).

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `images` array in the response will always be empty after a successful playlist creation. 

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The response schema indicates that the `images` property is an array, which can contain multiple image objects. The description suggests that this array is meant to hold cover art for the playlist.
2. **Semantic Meaning**: The invariant implies that no images will ever be returned, which contradicts the purpose of the `images` field as described in the Swagger documentation. If the API is designed to return cover art, it is reasonable to expect that this array may contain image objects, especially if the playlist has associated images.
3. **Testing Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample. However, the absence of counterexamples does not necessarily validate the invariant, especially if the API's design allows for the possibility of images being returned.
4. **Specification Contradiction**: The invariant restricts the `images` array to always being empty, which is not supported by the API's intended functionality as described in the Swagger definition. The API is likely to return images if they are available, making this invariant a false-positive.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant that `return.images[] == []` is a false-positive because it contradicts the expected behavior of the API as described in the Swagger definition. The API is designed to potentially return images, and the invariant's claim that this array will always be empty is not supported by the API's purpose.

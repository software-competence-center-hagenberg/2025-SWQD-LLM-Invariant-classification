### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint for creating a playlist. The response includes two properties: `id`, which is the Spotify ID of the playlist, and `external_urls`, which contains a property `spotify` that is a URL pointing to the playlist.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.id` is a substring of `return.external_urls.spotify`. This means that the playlist ID should appear somewhere within the Spotify URL for that playlist.

### Analysis
- The examples provided show that the `id` is indeed a substring of the `external_urls.spotify` URL. For instance, in the first example, the `id` is `7cSfJ0O7xMVR44LOWl4gwi`, which is found in the URL `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7cSfJ0O7xMVR44LOWl4gwi`. 
- The invariant has been tested against 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, and there are 11,650 examples in total, indicating a strong correlation between the `id` and the `external_urls.spotify`.
- The specification does not contradict this invariant, as it is logical for the ID of a playlist to be part of its URL.

### Conclusion
Given the strong evidence from the examples and the lack of counterexamples, the invariant that `return.id` is a substring of `return.external_urls.spotify` appears to be a true-positive. The invariant is consistent with the expected behavior of the API as described in the Swagger definition.

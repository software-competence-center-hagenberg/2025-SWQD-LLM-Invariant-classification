Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/users/{user_id}/playlists"
  post:
    description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
    parameters:
    requestBody:
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            description:
              type: string
    responses:
      '201':
        description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            description:
              type: string
              description: The playlist description. Only returned for modified, verified playlists, otherwise null.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.description == return.description

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StringEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two String scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 6379 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.description=apple piano; output.description=apple piano
input.description=qwerty italian the; output.description=qwerty italian the
input.description=7Metallica; output.description=7Metallica
input.description=Playlist soundtrack flute; output.description=Playlist soundtrack flute
input.description=1the; output.description=1the

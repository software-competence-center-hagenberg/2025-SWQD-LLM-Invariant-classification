### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a POST endpoint for creating a playlist, which returns a response containing a `tracks` object. Within this object, there is a property called `limit`, which is described as an integer representing the maximum number of items in the response. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.tracks.limit == 100`. This suggests that the `limit` value in the response is always 100, regardless of the input or other conditions. 

### Analysis
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found, which strongly supports the claim that the invariant holds true in the tested scenarios. 
- **Distinct Values**: The invariant description indicates that there is only one distinct value (100) found in the requests data, which further supports the idea that the `limit` is consistently set to 100. 
- **Specification Considerations**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `limit` can take on multiple values or that it can vary based on different conditions. Therefore, the invariant does not contradict the specification. 

### Conclusion
Given the strong empirical evidence from the tests and the lack of contradictory information in the Swagger definition, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the extensive testing and the consistent results observed.

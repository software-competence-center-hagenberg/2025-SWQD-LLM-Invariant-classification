### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint for creating a playlist. The response schema indicates that the response will contain two properties: `type` and `uri`. The `type` is a string that represents the object type, which is specified to be 'playlist'. The `uri` is a string that represents the Spotify URI of the playlist.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.type` is a substring of `return.uri`. In this context, `return.type` will always be 'playlist' based on the Swagger definition, and `return.uri` will contain the Spotify URI of the created playlist.

### Analysis
Given the examples provided:
- `output.type=playlist; output.uri=spotify:playlist:6sxoTIz62pCuW71hPY4yLL`
- `output.type=playlist; output.uri=spotify:playlist:3zy47q2iaJkIcvR3yVSsAu`
- `output.type=playlist; output.uri=spotify:playlist:5SnI7Z7gYIczJRFQZgidUe`
- `output.type=playlist; output.uri=spotify:playlist:5wmt55q5b6ddeqFstWMb9S`
- `output.type=playlist; output.uri=spotify:playlist:3ayWmHOlo8Hi2Yfgr5AAs3`

In all these examples, the `return.type` ('playlist') is indeed a substring of the `return.uri` (e.g., 'spotify:playlist:...'). Since the invariant has been tested against 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, it strongly suggests that this relationship holds consistently across valid responses from the API.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant that `return.type` is a substring of `return.uri` is a true-positive. The invariant holds true for every valid request on the API, as the `type` is always 'playlist' and is consistently found within the `uri`. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive** with high confidence.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/users/{user_id}/playlists"
  post:
    description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
    parameters:
    requestBody:
        schema:
          type: object
    responses:
      '201':
        description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            followers:
              type: object
              description: Information about the followers of the playlist.
              properties:
                total:
                  type: integer
                  description: The total number of followers.
          properties:

              items:
                type: object
                properties:
                  height:
                    description: The image height in pixels. If unknown: null or not returned.
                  url:
                    description: The source URL of the image.
                  width:
                    description: The image width in pixels. If unknown: null or not returned.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.followers.total == size(return.images[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual

Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.

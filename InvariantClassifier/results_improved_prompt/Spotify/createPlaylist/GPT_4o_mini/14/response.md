### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST request to create a playlist for a user. The response schema indicates that the response will include an `external_urls` object under the `owner` property. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.owner.external_urls != null`, meaning that the `external_urls` property in the response should never be null. 

### Analysis
Given that the invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, it suggests that in practice, the API consistently returns a non-null `external_urls` object when a playlist is successfully created. Additionally, the specification does not explicitly state that `external_urls` can be null, which supports the idea that it should always have a value. 

However, we must consider the possibility that the API could change in the future or that there might be edge cases not covered by the tests. Still, the absence of counterexamples in extensive testing strongly indicates that this invariant is likely to hold true. 

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant `return.owner.external_urls != null` is classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the extensive testing conducted without finding any counterexamples.

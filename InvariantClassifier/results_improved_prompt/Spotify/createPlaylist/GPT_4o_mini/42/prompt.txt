Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

    parameters:
    requestBody:
        schema:
          type: object
    responses:
      '201':
        description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            href:

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 10000 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/6Otu3Tx5jfrVi4dwocOHkR; output.type=playlist

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a POST endpoint for creating a playlist, which returns a response containing an 'images' property. This property is described as an array of objects, where each object represents an image with properties for height, width, and URL.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.images != null`, which means that the 'images' field in the response should never be null.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Response**: The 'images' field is defined as an array. In JSON, an array can be empty or contain objects, but it is not expected to be null. The specification does not indicate that 'images' can be null; it only describes it as an array.
2. **Testing Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample. This suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true under normal operation of the API.
3. **Specification Clarity**: The Swagger definition does not contradict the invariant. Since 'images' is an array, it is reasonable to conclude that it should not be null, aligning with typical API design practices.

### Conclusion
Given the definition of the 'images' property as an array and the absence of any counterexamples in extensive testing, the invariant `return.images != null` is classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the strong evidence from testing and the alignment with the API specification.

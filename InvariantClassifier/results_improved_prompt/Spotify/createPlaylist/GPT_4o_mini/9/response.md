### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a playlist. The response for a successful creation (HTTP status 201) includes a schema with a property `external_urls`, which is an object containing known external URLs for the playlist.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `external_urls` field in the response should not be null: `return.external_urls != null`. This implies that every successful response from this endpoint must include a non-null `external_urls` object.

### Analysis
Given that the invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, it suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true for this API. The absence of counterexamples indicates that every response received during testing has included a non-null `external_urls` object. 

Additionally, the specification does not contradict this invariant; it does not mention any scenarios where `external_urls` could be null. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the API is designed to always provide this field when a playlist is successfully created.

### Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the alignment of the invariant with the API's expected behavior as described in the Swagger definition, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the lack of counterexamples and the clear specification of the response structure.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/users/{user_id}/playlists' has a POST operation to create a playlist.
- The response to this operation is expected to have a '201' status code with a response body containing the 'external_urls' property.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.owner.external_urls != null', which checks if the 'external_urls' property in the response body is not null.

## Analysis
- Based on the Swagger definition, the response to the POST operation is expected to have the 'external_urls' property, which implies that it should not be null.
- The invariant aligns with the expected behavior described in the Swagger definition.
- The 10000 calls made to the API did not find a single counter example, indicating a high likelihood of the invariant holding true.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.owner.external_urls != null' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

        schema:
          type: object
    responses:
      '201':
        description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            href:
              type: string
              description: A link to the Web API endpoint providing full details of the playlist.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 10000 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/0xlHgOQkTfzgP7InXkLIyL; return.tracks.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/0xlHgOQkTfzgP7InXkLIyL/tracks

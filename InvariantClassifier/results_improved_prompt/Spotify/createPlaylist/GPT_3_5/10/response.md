## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/users/{user_id}/playlists' has a POST method to create a playlist.
- The response to this POST request includes a 'followers' field, which is an object containing information about the followers of the playlist.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.followers != null', which checks if the 'followers' field in the response is not null.

## Analysis
Based on the Swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to expect that the 'followers' field in the response should not be null. This is because the 'followers' field is described as containing information about the followers of the playlist, and it would make sense for this field to be present in the response when a playlist is created.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

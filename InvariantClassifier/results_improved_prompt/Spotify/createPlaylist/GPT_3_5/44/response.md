## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint /users/{user_id}/playlists has a POST method to create a playlist.
- The response schema includes the fields 'external_urls' and 'type'.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.owner.type is a substring of return.owner.external_urls.spotify

## Analysis
The invariant compares the 'type' field of the response with a substring of the 'spotify' field in 'external_urls'. The 'type' field is expected to be a string, and the 'spotify' field is also expected to be a string.

The invariant has been tested with 10000 calls, and no counterexamples have been found. There are 5 distinct examples of the invariant holding, with example values provided.

Given the nature of the 'type' and 'spotify' fields, and the large number of examples tested, it is likely that the invariant holds for all valid requests on the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

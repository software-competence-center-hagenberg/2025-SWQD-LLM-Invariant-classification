We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 10000 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.external_urls.spotify=https://open.spotify.com/playlist/11gXEBuRNrdBJVgP0uJ2fL; return.type=playlist

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/users/{user_id}/playlists' has a POST method for creating a playlist.
- The response to this POST request contains an array of images, each with properties 'height', 'url', and 'width'.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.images[] == []', which states that the 'images' array in the response should be empty.

## Analysis
- Based on the Swagger definition, there is no explicit constraint on the 'images' array to be non-empty.
- The invariant is a unary sequence invariant, which checks if the array 'images' takes on only a few distinct values.
- The invariant does not contradict the specification, and there is no indication that the 'images' array should always be empty.
- The absence of counterexamples from 10000 API calls suggests that the 'images' array has been consistently empty in the responses.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.images[] == []' is likely a true-positive, as it holds for all the observed responses and is not contradicted by the specification.

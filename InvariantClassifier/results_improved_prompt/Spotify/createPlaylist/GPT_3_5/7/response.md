## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint is for creating a playlist and the response contains information about the followers of the playlist and the cover art for the album.
- The response schema includes a 'followers' object with a 'total' field representing the total number of followers, and an 'images' array containing cover art information.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.followers.total == size(return.images[])
This means that the total number of followers should be equal to the size of the 'images' array in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the nature of the response, it is reasonable to expect that the total number of followers should be equal to the number of cover art images for the playlist. This is because each follower may have a preference for a specific cover art, and the number of followers should correspond to the number of cover art images available.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The POST request to create a playlist returns a response with the Spotify ID of the playlist and the external URLs for the playlist.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the Spotify ID (return.id) is a substring of the Spotify URL (return.external_urls.spotify).

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 10000 of them being distinct examples.
- In all 10000 distinct examples, the Spotify ID is indeed a substring of the Spotify URL, as demonstrated by the provided examples.
- The Spotify ID is a unique identifier for the playlist, and it makes sense for it to be a substring of the Spotify URL for the playlist.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the semantic relationship between the Spotify ID and the Spotify URL, the invariant is a true-positive.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/users/{user_id}/playlists"
  post:
    description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
    parameters:
    requestBody:
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            public:
              type: boolean
    responses:
      '201':
        description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            public:
              type: boolean
              description: The playlist's public/private status: true the playlist is public, false the playlist is private, null the playlist status is not relevant. For more about public/private status, see Working with Playlists.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.public == return.public

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two long scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 2 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 2 example values of the variables:
input.public=false; return.public=false
input.public=true; return.public=true

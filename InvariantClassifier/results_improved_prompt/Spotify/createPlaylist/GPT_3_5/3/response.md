## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The POST request to "/users/{user_id}/playlists" expects a request body with a boolean property 'public'.
- The response to this request includes a boolean property 'public' that represents the playlist's public/private status.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the 'public' property in the request body should be equal to the 'public' property in the response body.

## Analysis
Based on the Swagger definition and the provided examples, it is reasonable to assume that the 'public' property in the request body should indeed be equal to the 'public' property in the response body. The specification does not mention any other possible values for the 'public' property in the response, and the examples provided align with the expected behavior.

## Conclusion
Given the consistency of the examples with the expected behavior and the absence of any contradicting information in the specification, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/users/{user_id}/playlists' has a POST method for creating a playlist.
- The response schema includes a property 'images' which is an array of objects with 'height', 'url', and 'width' properties.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.images != null', which means that the 'images' property in the response should not be null.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to expect that the 'images' property in the response should not be null. The schema does not indicate that 'images' can be null, and the invariant aligns with the expected behavior of the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/users/{user_id}/playlists"
  post:
    description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
    parameters:
    requestBody:
        schema:
          type: object
    responses:
      '201':
        description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            external_urls:
              type: object
              description: Known external URLs for this album.
              properties:
                spotify:
                  type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.external_urls.spotify is Url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsUrl
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable is always a URL. Represented as x is Url.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 10000 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.external_urls.spotify=https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5U8qiYtM4L9MaIeVimM3cJ
return.external_urls.spotify=https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4tM1CZQzkCEFrIPyMC4lXU
return.external_urls.spotify=https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6ls3w3y455k46QaGKdWrYU
return.external_urls.spotify=https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4vDsKDQagqQAijlgz66pkW

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve the tracks of an album, which includes information about the artists associated with each track. The response schema indicates that the `items` property is an array of tracks, each containing an `artists` array. Each artist object within this array includes an `external_urls` property, which is an object containing known external URLs for the artist.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.external_urls != null`, meaning that for every artist in the response, the `external_urls` property should not be null.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The Swagger definition indicates that `external_urls` is part of the artist object. Since the invariant is concerned with the `external_urls` field, we need to consider whether it is guaranteed to be present and non-null for every artist returned in the response.
2. **Testing Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true across a wide range of requests.
3. **Specification Review**: The specification does not explicitly state that `external_urls` can be null or omitted. Given that it is described as part of the artist object, it is reasonable to infer that it should be present for each artist.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the Swagger definition and the extensive testing conducted, the invariant `return.external_urls != null` appears to be a true-positive. There is no indication from the specification that this field can be null, and the lack of counterexamples in testing further supports this conclusion. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a true-positive with high confidence.

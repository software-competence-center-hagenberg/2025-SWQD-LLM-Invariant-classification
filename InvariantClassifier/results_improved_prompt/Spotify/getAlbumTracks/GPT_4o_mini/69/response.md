### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving tracks from a specific album. The response includes an `href` which is a URL pointing to the track's API endpoint and an `id` which is the Spotify ID for the track. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.id` is a substring of `return.href`. This means that the track ID should be found within the URL that points to the track's API endpoint. 

### Analysis
In the examples provided, the `href` values are structured as follows: `https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/{id}`. This indicates that the `{id}` in the URL corresponds directly to the `id` of the track. Given that the `id` is placed in the URL, it is reasonable to conclude that the `id` will always be a substring of the `href`. 

Additionally, the fact that 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample strengthens the case for this invariant. The large number of distinct examples (1,956) also supports the consistency of this relationship. 

### Conclusion
Based on the structure of the API response and the consistent examples provided, the invariant that `return.id` is a substring of `return.href` is a true-positive. The invariant holds true for every valid request on the API as the `id` is always included in the `href` as part of the URL structure.

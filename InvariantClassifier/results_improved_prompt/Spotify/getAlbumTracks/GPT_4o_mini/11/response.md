### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the response for the GET request to `/albums/{id}/tracks` includes an array of items, where each item has a property called `type`. The `type` is specified to be a string, and the description explicitly states that the object type is 'track'. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.type == "track"`, meaning that every item in the response's `items` array should have a `type` value of 'track'. 

### Analysis
Given the definition in the Swagger documentation, it is clear that the API is designed to return tracks from an album, and thus the `type` for each item in the `items` array should indeed be 'track'. The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which strongly suggests that this behavior is consistent across requests. Furthermore, the presence of 164,046 examples in the request data, with only one distinct example, indicates that the API consistently returns 'track' as the type for items. 

### Conclusion
Based on the Swagger definition and the extensive testing that has shown no counterexamples, the invariant `return.type == "track"` is a true-positive. It holds for every valid request on the API as per the provided documentation and testing results.

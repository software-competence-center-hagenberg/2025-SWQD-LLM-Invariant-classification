### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve tracks from an album, with a response schema that includes an array of items. Each item has a property `is_local`, which is a boolean indicating whether the track is local.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.is_local == false`, meaning that every track returned in the response should have `is_local` set to false.

### Analysis
1. **Context of the API**: The API is designed to return tracks from an album, and the `is_local` property indicates whether a track is local or not. The presence of this property suggests that there can be both local and non-local tracks.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, the fact that only 1 distinct example was found among 164,046 examples raises a concern. It suggests that while the invariant holds in the tested cases, it may not represent the full range of possible responses from the API.
3. **Specification Consideration**: The specification does not explicitly state that all tracks must be non-local. Therefore, it is possible that some tracks could be local, which would contradict the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the value of `is_local` to false without any explicit support from the API specification and considering the nature of the `is_local` property (which can logically be both true and false), this invariant is likely a **false-positive**. The lack of counterexamples in the tested calls does not sufficiently justify the claim that `is_local` can only be false, especially when the API's design suggests the possibility of local tracks.

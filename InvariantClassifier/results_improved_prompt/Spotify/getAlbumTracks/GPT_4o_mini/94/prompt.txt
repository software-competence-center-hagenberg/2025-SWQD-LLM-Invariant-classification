Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/albums/{id}/tracks"
  get:
    description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
    parameters:
      - name: limit
        in: query
        description: The maximum number of items to return
        type: integer
        minimum: 0
        maxLength: 50
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                disc_number:
                  type: integer
                  description: The disc number (usually 1 unless the album consists of more than one disc).


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.limit >= return.disc_number

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of >= between two long scalars. Prints as x >= y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 1000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 1073 examples in the requests data, with 151 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.limit=10; output.items.disc_number=3
input.limit=46; output.items.disc_number=4
input.limit=46; output.items.disc_number=5
input.limit=46; output.items.disc_number=2
input.limit=46; output.items.disc_number=3

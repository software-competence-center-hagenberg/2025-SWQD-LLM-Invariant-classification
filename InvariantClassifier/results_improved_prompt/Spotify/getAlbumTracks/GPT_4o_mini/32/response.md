### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies a GET request to the endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` with a query parameter `limit`. This parameter is defined as an integer with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum length of 50. The response schema also includes a `limit` property, which is described as the maximum number of items in the response, corresponding to the `limit` set in the query.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter `limit` (from the request) is equal to the output parameter `limit` (from the response): `input.limit == return.limit`. This means that whatever value is provided in the request for `limit` should be the same value returned in the response.

### Analysis
The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found, which strongly suggests that the invariant holds true for the tested cases. Additionally, there are 5,819 examples of requests, with 50 distinct examples, all showing that the input `limit` matches the output `limit`. The Swagger definition does not contradict this invariant, as it explicitly states that the response's `limit` reflects the maximum number of items as set in the query.

### Conclusion
Given the strong evidence from the testing and the alignment with the Swagger definition, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. The invariant is likely to hold for all valid requests to this API endpoint, as it is directly supported by the API's design and behavior.

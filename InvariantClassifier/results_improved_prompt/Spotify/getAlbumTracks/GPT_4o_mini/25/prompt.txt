Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/albums/{id}/tracks"
  get:
    description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                disc_number:
                  type: integer
                  description: The disc number (usually 1 unless the album consists of more than one disc).
              items:
                duration_ms:
                  type: integer
                  description: The track length in milliseconds.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.disc_number < return.duration_ms

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntLessThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of < between two long scalars. Prints as x < y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 164046 examples in the requests data, with 1745 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.items.disc_number=2; output.items.duration_ms=154453
output.items.disc_number=1; output.items.duration_ms=210880
output.items.disc_number=3; output.items.duration_ms=182760
output.items.disc_number=1; output.items.duration_ms=415306
output.items.disc_number=1; output.items.duration_ms=139453

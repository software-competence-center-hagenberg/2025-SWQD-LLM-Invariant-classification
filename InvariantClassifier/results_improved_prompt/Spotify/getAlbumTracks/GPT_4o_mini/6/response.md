### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve the tracks of a specific album. The response is expected to be an object containing an array of items, where each item represents a track and includes a property `external_urls` which is an object containing known external URLs for the track.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.external_urls != null`, meaning that for every track returned in the response, the `external_urls` property should not be null.

### Analysis
Given that the invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, it suggests a strong likelihood that this invariant holds true for the API. The specification does not indicate that `external_urls` can be null, and since it is described as an object that contains known external URLs, it is reasonable to conclude that it should always be present for tracks that have external URLs available. 

However, it is important to consider that the API might return tracks without external URLs in certain cases, such as if the track does not have any associated external links. If the API specification does not explicitly guarantee that `external_urls` will always be present, then the invariant could potentially be a false-positive.

### Conclusion
While the lack of counterexamples from 10,000 calls strongly suggests that the invariant holds, the absence of explicit guarantees in the API specification regarding the presence of `external_urls` means that we cannot be entirely certain. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** due to the potential for tracks to exist without external URLs, despite the strong empirical evidence.

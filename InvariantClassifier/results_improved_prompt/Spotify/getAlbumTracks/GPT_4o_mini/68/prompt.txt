Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/albums/{id}/tracks"
  get:
    description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                uri:
                  type: string
                  description: The Spotify URI for the track.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.uri)==36

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 164046 examples in the requests data, with 1956 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.items.uri=spotify:track:0nJW01T7XtvILxQgC5J7Wh
output.items.uri=spotify:track:14KJ4z8yElYkBfZ59cRG3a
output.items.uri=spotify:track:5o8OdhjVZSF2wCj7M8UpMN

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/albums/{id}/tracks"
  get:
    description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
    parameters:
      - name: limit
        in: query
        description: The maximum number of items to return
        type: integer
        minimum: 0
        maxLength: 50
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                duration_ms:
                  type: integer
                  description: The track length in milliseconds.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.limit < return.duration_ms

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntLessThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of < between two long scalars. Prints as x < y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 85750 examples in the requests data, with 40977 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.limit=33; output.items.duration_ms=320642
input.limit=27; output.items.duration_ms=254520
input.limit=41; output.items.duration_ms=182162
input.limit=50; output.items.duration_ms=202666
input.limit=14; output.items.duration_ms=242090

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/albums/{id}/tracks"
  get:
    description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
    parameters:
      - name: offset
        in: query
        description: The index of the first item to return
        type: integer
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            total:
              type: integer
              description: The total number of items available to return.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.offset != return.total

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two long scalars. Prints as x != y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 68 examples in the requests data, with 44 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.offset=16; output.total=61
input.offset=5; output.total=67
input.offset=12; output.total=4
input.offset=5; output.total=20
input.offset=14; output.total=16

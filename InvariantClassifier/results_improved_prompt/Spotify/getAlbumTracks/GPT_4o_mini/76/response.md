### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an endpoint that retrieves tracks from an album. The response includes a property `linked_from`, which contains an object with two string properties: `id` and `uri`. The `id` is the Spotify ID for the track, and the `uri` is the Spotify URI for the track. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.linked_from.id` is a substring of `return.linked_from.uri`. This means that the ID should be found within the URI string. 

### Analysis
From the examples provided, we can see that the `id` and `uri` are formatted in a consistent manner. The `uri` for a track is structured as `spotify:track:<id>`, where `<id>` is the actual track ID. This indicates that the ID is indeed a substring of the URI, as the URI contains the ID at the end after the last colon. 

Additionally, the fact that 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample strengthens the case for this invariant being true. The large number of distinct examples (1,736) also supports the consistency of this relationship across different tracks. 

### Conclusion
Given the consistent formatting of the `id` and `uri`, the absence of counterexamples in extensive testing, and the logical relationship between the two fields, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The invariant holds for every valid request on the API, as the structure of the URI inherently includes the ID as a substring.

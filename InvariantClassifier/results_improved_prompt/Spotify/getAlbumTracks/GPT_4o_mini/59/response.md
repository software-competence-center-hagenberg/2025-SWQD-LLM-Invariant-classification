### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` returns a response containing a property `href`, which is a string. The description provided does not specify any constraints on the length of this string, nor does it indicate that it will always have a fixed length.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the string `output.items.linked_from.href` is always equal to 56 characters. This is a very specific constraint on the length of a string that is not supported by the Swagger definition.

### Analysis
1. **Length Constraint**: The invariant imposes a strict length requirement of 56 characters on the `href` string. However, the examples provided show that the `href` values are URLs that vary in length. For instance, the example URLs provided are longer than 56 characters, indicating that the invariant does not hold.
2. **Counterexamples**: Despite the claim of no counterexamples found in 10,000 calls, the nature of URLs suggests that they can vary significantly in length. The examples provided already contradict the invariant, as they are longer than 56 characters.
3. **Specification**: The Swagger definition does not mention any fixed length for the `href` property, which further suggests that the invariant is not supported by the API's specification.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant states a fixed length of 56 characters for a string that is not constrained by the API specification and is contradicted by the examples provided, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear evidence against the invariant.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that retrieves tracks from a specific album. The response includes an array of items, each of which may contain a `linked_from` object. This object has a property `uri`, which is a string representing the Spotify URI for the track.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `linked_from.uri` string is always 36 characters: `LENGTH(return.linked_from.uri)==36`. This suggests that every URI returned by this API endpoint has a fixed length of 36 characters.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the URI Structure**: The Spotify URI format for tracks is `spotify:track:{track_id}`. The `track_id` is a unique identifier for each track. In the examples provided, the `track_id` appears to be a string of 22 characters, and when combined with the prefix `spotify:track:`, the total length becomes 36 characters.
2. **Consistency Across Calls**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong consistency in the length of the `linked_from.uri` values returned by the API.
3. **Distinct Examples**: There are 2,756 examples of the `linked_from.uri`, with 199 distinct values. This indicates that while there are many different tracks, they all conform to the same URI structure.
4. **Specification Support**: The Swagger definition does not contradict the invariant, as it does not specify any other formats or lengths for the `uri` field.

### Conclusion
Given the consistent structure of the Spotify URIs, the lack of counterexamples across a large number of API calls, and the support from the Swagger definition, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. The invariant accurately reflects the behavior of the API regarding the length of the `linked_from.uri` string.

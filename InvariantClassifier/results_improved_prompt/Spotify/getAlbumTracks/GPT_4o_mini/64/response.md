### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is designed to retrieve the tracks of a specific album. The response schema indicates that it returns an object containing an array of items, where each item has a `preview_url` property that is a string. The description of `preview_url` specifies that it is a URL to a 30-second MP3 preview of the track.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `preview_url` string is always 107 characters: `LENGTH(return.preview_url)==107`. This is a fixed-length string invariant.

### Analysis
1. **Nature of URLs**: URLs can vary in length based on various factors, including the specific resource being accessed, query parameters, and identifiers. Given that the `preview_url` is dynamically generated based on the track, it is unlikely that all URLs will consistently have the same length.
2. **Examples Provided**: The examples provided show different `preview_url` values, and while they may have a similar structure, they do not guarantee that all possible URLs will have a length of 107 characters. The presence of 125,786 examples without a counterexample does suggest a strong tendency, but it does not definitively prove that no other lengths exist.
3. **Specification Considerations**: The API documentation does not explicitly state that the `preview_url` will always be of a fixed length. This lack of specification means that the invariant could potentially be violated by other URLs that may be generated in the future or that are not represented in the current dataset.

### Conclusion
Given the nature of URLs and the lack of explicit specification confirming that all `preview_url` strings will always be of length 107, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a **false-positive**. While the data suggests a strong correlation, the possibility of other lengths existing cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the invariant does not hold universally for all valid requests on the API.

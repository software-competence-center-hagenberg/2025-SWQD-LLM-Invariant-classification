Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/albums/{id}/tracks"
  get:
    description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                available_markets:
                  type: array
                  description: A list of the countries in which the track can be played, identified by their ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code.
                  items:
                    type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: All the elements of return.available_markets[] have LENGTH=2

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.stringsequence.SequenceFixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that all the elements of an array of strings have a fixed length n. Represented as All the elements of x have LENGTH=n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 81695 examples in the requests data, with 17 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:
output.items.available_markets=["CA","US"]

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the response for the endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` includes an array of items, where each item contains an array of artists. Each artist object has a property called `type`, which is defined as a string with the description stating that it should be 'artist'.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.type == "artist"`, meaning that the `type` field for each artist in the response should always be equal to the string 'artist'.

### Analysis
Given that the Swagger definition explicitly states that the `type` of the artist object is a string and describes it as 'artist', this suggests that the API is designed to return this specific value for the `type` field. The fact that 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample strongly supports the idea that this invariant holds true for the API. Additionally, the presence of 198,745 examples with only one distinct value further reinforces the likelihood that the `type` will consistently be 'artist'. 

### Conclusion
Based on the provided information, the invariant appears to be a true-positive. The API's design, as indicated by the Swagger definition, supports the invariant, and the extensive testing without counterexamples further solidifies this classification. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a true-positive with high confidence.

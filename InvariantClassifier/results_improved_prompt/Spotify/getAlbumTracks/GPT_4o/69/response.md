### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is used to retrieve the tracks of a specific album from Spotify's API. The response includes an `href` property, which is a URL to the Web API endpoint, and an `items` array, where each item represents a track with an `id` property that is a string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.id` is a substring of `return.href`. This means that the track ID should appear somewhere within the URL provided in the `href` field.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `href` field is a URL that points to a specific track, and the `id` is the Spotify ID for that track. It is logical for the track ID to be part of the URL, as URLs often include identifiers to specify resources.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there were 164,046 examples supporting the invariant, with 1,956 distinct examples.

3. **Example Verification**: The examples provided show that the `id` is indeed a substring of the `href`, as the URL structure includes the track ID as part of the path.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic reasoning that URLs typically include identifiers for resources and the strong empirical evidence from a large number of examples without any counterexamples, it is highly likely that this invariant is a true-positive. The invariant aligns with the expected structure of URLs in REST APIs, particularly for identifying resources like tracks in Spotify's API.

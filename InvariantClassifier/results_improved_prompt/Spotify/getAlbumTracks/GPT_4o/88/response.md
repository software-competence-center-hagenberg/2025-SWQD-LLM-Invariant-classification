### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is used to retrieve tracks from a specific album on Spotify. The request can include a query parameter `market`, which is a string representing an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. The response includes a field `next`, which is a URL string pointing to the next page of items, or null if there are no more items.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `input.market` is a substring of `return.next`. This means that the market code provided in the request should appear somewhere in the `next` URL returned in the response.

### Analysis

- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.
- **Examples**: The examples provided show that the `market` parameter is indeed included as a query parameter in the `next` URL. This is consistent across multiple examples with different market codes.
- **Specification Consistency**: The swagger definition does not explicitly state that the `market` parameter must be included in the `next` URL, but the examples and the lack of counterexamples suggest that this is the case.
- **Semantic Reasoning**: It makes logical sense for the `market` parameter to be included in the `next` URL, as it would ensure that subsequent requests for paginated data remain consistent with the original market context.

### Conclusion

Given the strong empirical evidence, the logical consistency of the invariant, and the semantic reasoning that supports the inclusion of the `market` parameter in the `next` URL, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a "true-positive". The invariant appears to hold true for all valid requests and responses based on the data provided.

**Confidence**: 0.95

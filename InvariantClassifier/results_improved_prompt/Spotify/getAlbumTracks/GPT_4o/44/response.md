### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is used to retrieve tracks from a specific album on Spotify. According to the Swagger definition:
- **offset**: This is an integer representing the starting point in the list of items to return. It is typically used for pagination.
- **total**: This is an integer representing the total number of items available to return.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.offset != return.total`, which suggests that the offset value in the response is never equal to the total number of items available.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Meaning**: 
   - **Offset** is used for pagination and indicates the starting point of the items returned in the current response.
   - **Total** represents the total number of items available in the dataset, not just those returned in the current response.

2. **Logical Consistency**:
   - Given the definitions, it is logically consistent that `offset` should not equal `total` because `offset` is a position within the list, whereas `total` is the size of the entire list.
   - The only scenario where `offset` could equal `total` is if the offset is set to the total number of items, which would mean starting the pagination beyond the available items, typically resulting in an empty response.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - With 100 calls and no counterexamples found, and 71 distinct examples supporting the invariant, the empirical evidence strongly supports the invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic roles of `offset` and `total`, and the empirical evidence from the API calls, the invariant `return.offset != return.total` is consistent with the expected behavior of the API. The invariant is likely a **true-positive** because it aligns with the logical use of pagination and total count in API responses.

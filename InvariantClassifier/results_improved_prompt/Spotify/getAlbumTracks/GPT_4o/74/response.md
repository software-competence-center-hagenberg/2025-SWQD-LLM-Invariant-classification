### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is used to retrieve the tracks of a specific album from the Spotify API. The response includes an `items` array, where each item can have a `linked_from` object. This object is present when track relinking is applied, and it contains information about the originally requested track. The `linked_from` object has a `type` property, which is described as the object type, specifically 'track'. Additionally, there is an `href` property, which is a URL linking to the Web API endpoint for the full result of the request.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.linked_from.type` is a substring of `return.linked_from.href`.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `type` field is explicitly described as having the value 'track'.
   - The `href` field is a URL that includes the path `/tracks/`, which naturally contains the substring 'track'.
   - Given the structure of Spotify's API URLs, it is reasonable to expect that any `href` for a track will include the substring 'track'.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls without finding a counterexample.
   - There are 164,046 examples supporting the invariant, with 1,736 distinct examples.
   - The example values provided show that the `href` indeed contains the substring 'track', consistent with the `type` being 'track'.

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The specification does not mention any other possible values for `type` other than 'track'.
   - The invariant aligns with the expected structure of the API response as per the documentation.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic alignment between the `type` and the structure of the `href`, the empirical evidence from a large number of API calls, and the consistency with the API specification, the invariant is very likely a "true-positive". The invariant is supported by both the API's design and the observed data.

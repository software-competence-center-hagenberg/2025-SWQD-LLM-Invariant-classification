### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is designed to retrieve tracks from a specific album on Spotify. The response schema includes an `items` array, where each item has an `external_urls` object. This object is described as containing known external URLs for the track.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.external_urls != null`, which implies that for every track in the `items` array, the `external_urls` object is not null.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The specification indicates that `external_urls` is an object meant to contain URLs. There is no explicit mention in the provided specification that `external_urls` can be null.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls to the API, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

3. **Semantic Consideration**: The `external_urls` field is likely intended to provide external links related to the track, which is a common feature in music APIs to link to external resources or platforms. It makes semantic sense for this field to be consistently non-null, as tracks typically have associated external URLs.

4. **Common API Practices**: In many APIs, fields that are objects and have a specific purpose (like linking to external resources) are often non-null, especially if they are part of the standard response structure.

### Conclusion

Given the strong empirical evidence from 10,000 API calls without a single null occurrence, the semantic appropriateness of the field being non-null, and the lack of specification indicating that `external_urls` can be null, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is a "true-positive."

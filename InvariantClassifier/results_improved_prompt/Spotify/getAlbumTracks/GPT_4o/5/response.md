### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` which is a GET request to retrieve the tracks of an album. The response schema includes an `items` array, where each item has a `disc_number` property. The `disc_number` is described as an integer representing the disc number, which is usually 1 unless the album consists of more than one disc.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.disc_number >= 1`. This invariant suggests that the `disc_number` for any track returned by this endpoint is always greater than or equal to 1.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Description**: The description of `disc_number` in the Swagger definition states that it is usually 1 unless the album consists of more than one disc. This implies that the minimum value for `disc_number` is 1, as there cannot be a disc number less than 1.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 164,046 examples were observed, with 5 distinct values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), all of which satisfy the invariant `disc_number >= 1`.

3. **Logical Consistency**: The invariant logically aligns with the description provided in the Swagger definition. Since disc numbers start from 1, it is consistent to expect that `disc_number` will always be greater than or equal to 1.

### Conclusion

Given the description in the Swagger definition, the empirical evidence from the calls, and the logical consistency of the invariant, it is highly likely that the invariant `return.disc_number >= 1` is a true-positive. There is no indication from the specification or the data that `disc_number` can be less than 1.

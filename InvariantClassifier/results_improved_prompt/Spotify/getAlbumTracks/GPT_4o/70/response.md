### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is designed to retrieve tracks from a specific album. The response includes a `href` field, which is a string containing a link to the Web API endpoint returning the full result of the request. The `items` array in the response contains track data, and each item may have a `linked_from` object if track relinking is applied. This `linked_from` object contains a `type` field, which is described as the object type and is expected to be 'track'.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.linked_from.type` is a substring of `return.href`. Specifically, it claims that the string value of `linked_from.type` (which is 'track') is a substring of the `href` URL.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `linked_from.type` is a constant string 'track', as per the specification. The `href` is a URL pointing to a track resource. Semantically, it makes sense that the word 'track' could appear in the URL, as the URL is related to track resources.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

3. **Distinct Examples**: Out of 2756 examples, 240 were distinct, and all adhered to the invariant. This further supports the invariant's validity.

4. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not contradict the invariant. The `linked_from.type` is always 'track', and it is reasonable for URLs related to tracks to contain the word 'track'.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic consistency, the empirical evidence from a large number of calls, and the lack of specification contradictions, the invariant that `return.linked_from.type` is a substring of `return.href` is likely a true-positive. The invariant aligns with the expected structure of URLs in the Spotify API, which are likely to include the term 'track' when referring to track resources.

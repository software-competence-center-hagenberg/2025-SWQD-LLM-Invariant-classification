### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is designed to retrieve the tracks of a specific album from Spotify's API. The response schema includes:
- `href`: A string that provides a link to the Web API endpoint returning the full result of the request.
- `items`: An array containing the requested data, where each item has a `type` property described as 'track'.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.items.type` is a substring of `return.items.linked_from.href`.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: According to the swagger definition, each item in the `items` array has a `type` property which is expected to be 'track'. The `linked_from.href` is a URL pointing to a specific track.

2. **Examples Provided**: The examples show that `return.items.type` is consistently 'track', and the `linked_from.href` is a URL that includes the word 'tracks', which is a substring of 'track'.

3. **Number of Calls and Examples**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample. There are 2756 examples, with 199 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.

4. **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant makes semantic sense because the `type` being 'track' is logically related to the `linked_from.href` which is a URL to a track resource.

5. **Specification Consistency**: The swagger definition does not contradict this invariant, as it specifies that the `type` is 'track', and the URL is related to tracks.

### Conclusion
Given the high number of calls and examples supporting the invariant, the semantic consistency, and the lack of contradiction in the specification, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant logically follows from the structure and semantics of the API response.

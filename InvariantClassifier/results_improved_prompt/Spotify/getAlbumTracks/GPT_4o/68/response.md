### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is used to retrieve tracks from a specific album on Spotify. The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a `uri` field, which is a string representing the Spotify URI for the track.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.uri)==36`, which suggests that the URI string for each track is always 36 characters long.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Specification**: The specification describes the `uri` as a string representing the Spotify URI for a track. While the specification does not explicitly state the length of the URI, Spotify URIs typically follow a specific format, such as `spotify:track:<22-character-identifier>`, which indeed results in a fixed length of 36 characters.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 164,046 examples were observed, with 1,956 distinct examples, all adhering to the invariant.

3. **Semantic Consistency**: The URI format `spotify:track:<identifier>` is consistent with the observed length of 36 characters. The identifier part is typically a 22-character string, which, when combined with the prefix `spotify:track:`, results in a total length of 36 characters.

4. **Potential for Variation**: Given the standardized format of Spotify URIs, it is unlikely that the length would vary unless Spotify changes their URI format, which would be a significant change likely documented in their API updates.

### Conclusion
The invariant `LENGTH(return.uri)==36` is consistent with the expected format of Spotify track URIs and is supported by extensive empirical evidence. There is no indication from the specification or observed data that the URI length would vary. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a "true-positive" with high confidence.

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.limit >= size(return.items[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of >= between two long scalars. Prints as x >= y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 5236 examples in the requests data, with 4020 of them being distinct examples.

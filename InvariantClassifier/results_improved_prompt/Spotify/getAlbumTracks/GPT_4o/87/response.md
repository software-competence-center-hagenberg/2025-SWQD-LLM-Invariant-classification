### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is used to retrieve tracks from a specific album on Spotify. The endpoint accepts a query parameter `market`, which is described as an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. The response includes a field `href`, which is a string representing a link to the Web API endpoint that returns the full result of the request.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `input.market` is a substring of `return.href`. This invariant suggests that the market parameter provided in the request is included in the `href` field of the response.

### Analysis

1. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

2. **Example Values**: The provided examples show that the `market` parameter is indeed included in the `href` field as a query parameter, e.g., `market=TZ` in `https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/0swM8EuQkgYV2knrZ8rFl2/tracks?offset=0&limit=22&market=TZ`.

3. **Semantic Analysis**: The `href` field is a URL that includes the query parameters used in the request. Since `market` is a query parameter, it is expected to appear in the URL if it is part of the request.

4. **Specification Alignment**: The specification does not explicitly state that the `market` parameter must appear in the `href`, but given the nature of URLs and query parameters, it is reasonable to expect this behavior.

### Conclusion

Given the strong empirical evidence, the semantic reasoning that URLs typically include query parameters, and the lack of any specification contradiction, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive." The `market` parameter being a substring of the `href` is consistent with how query parameters are typically handled in URLs.

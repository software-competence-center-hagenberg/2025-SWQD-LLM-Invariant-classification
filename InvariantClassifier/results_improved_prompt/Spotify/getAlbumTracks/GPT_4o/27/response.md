### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is designed to retrieve tracks from a specific album. The response schema includes an array of `items`, where each item has two properties:
- `duration_ms`: An integer representing the track's length in milliseconds.
- `track_number`: An integer representing the track's position on the album.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.duration_ms > return.track_number`, which suggests that for each track in the album, the duration in milliseconds is greater than the track number.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - **`duration_ms`**: This represents the length of a track in milliseconds. Typical track durations are in the range of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of milliseconds (e.g., 3 minutes is 180,000 ms).
   - **`track_number`**: This is a simple integer indicating the order of the track on the album. It is usually a small number, often less than 20.

2. **Logical Consistency**:
   - Given the typical values for `duration_ms` (e.g., 120,000 ms for a 2-minute song) and `track_number` (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.), it is logically consistent that `duration_ms` would be greater than `track_number`.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found.
   - A large number of examples (164,046) were observed, with 1,768 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.

4. **Specification Check**:
   - The specification does not mention any special cases or conditions where `duration_ms` could be less than or equal to `track_number`.

### Conclusion

The invariant `return.duration_ms > return.track_number` is logically sound given the typical values and semantics of the involved variables. The extensive empirical evidence further supports this conclusion. Therefore, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive".

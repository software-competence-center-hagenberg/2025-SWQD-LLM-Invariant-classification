### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is used to retrieve tracks from a specific album on Spotify. The response includes an array of items, each potentially containing a `linked_from` object. This object is relevant when track relinking occurs, and it includes a `uri` property, which is a string representing the Spotify URI for the track.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.linked_from.uri)==36`, which suggests that the `uri` string in the `linked_from` object always has a length of 36 characters.

### Analysis
1. **Data Collected**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true.
2. **Distinct Examples**: Out of 2,756 examples, 199 were distinct, and all adhered to the invariant.
3. **Example Values**: The provided example URIs (`spotify:track:3w3y8KPTfNeOKPiqUTakBh`, etc.) are all 36 characters long, consistent with the invariant.
4. **URI Structure**: Spotify URIs typically follow a fixed structure, which includes a prefix (`spotify:track:`) and a unique identifier. The prefix is 13 characters long, and the identifier is 23 characters long, totaling 36 characters.
5. **Specification Consistency**: The swagger definition does not specify any alternative formats or lengths for the `uri`, which supports the invariant's validity.

### Conclusion
Given the consistent length of the Spotify URIs observed, the lack of counterexamples in a large sample size, and the typical structure of Spotify URIs, it is highly likely that the invariant `LENGTH(return.linked_from.uri)==36` is a true-positive. The invariant aligns with the expected format of Spotify track URIs, and there is no evidence to suggest variability in length.

**Verdict**: True-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

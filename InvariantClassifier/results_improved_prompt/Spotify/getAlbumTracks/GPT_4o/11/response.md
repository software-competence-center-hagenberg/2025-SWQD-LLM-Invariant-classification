### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is designed to retrieve tracks from a specific album on Spotify. According to the Swagger definition provided:
- The response schema includes an `items` array.
- Each item in this array has a `type` property.
- The `type` property is described as "The object type: 'track'."

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.type == "track"`.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Definition Alignment**: The Swagger documentation explicitly states that the `type` of each item in the `items` array is 'track'. This aligns perfectly with the invariant, suggesting that the invariant is indeed expected behavior.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested over 10,000 calls without encountering a single counterexample. This high number of calls without deviation strongly supports the invariant's validity.

3. **Distinct Examples**: Out of 164,046 examples, only one distinct value ('track') was observed for `return.items.type`. This further reinforces the invariant as a true representation of the API's behavior.

4. **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant makes semantic sense given the context of the API, which is to retrieve tracks from an album. It is logical that each item returned would be of type 'track'.

### Conclusion

Given the alignment with the Swagger definition, the empirical evidence from a large number of calls, and the semantic consistency of the invariant, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant accurately reflects the expected behavior of the API as documented and observed.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is designed to retrieve tracks from a specific album. The response includes an array of items, each containing a `preview_url`, which is described as a URL to a 30-second preview of the track in MP3 format.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.preview_url` is always a URL.

### Analysis
- **Swagger Specification**: The `preview_url` is explicitly defined as a string that represents a URL. This aligns with the invariant that the value is always a URL.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there were 125,786 examples in the request data, with 2,652 distinct examples, all conforming to the URL format.
- **Example Values**: The provided example values for `preview_url` are all valid URLs, further supporting the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the explicit definition in the Swagger specification that `preview_url` is a URL, the extensive testing without counterexamples, and the large number of examples all conforming to the URL format, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive." The invariant is consistent with the API's intended behavior and the data observed in practice.

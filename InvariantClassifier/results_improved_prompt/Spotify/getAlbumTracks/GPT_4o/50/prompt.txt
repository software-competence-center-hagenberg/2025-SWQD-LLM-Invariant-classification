Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/albums/{id}/tracks"
  get:
    description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                artists:
                  type: array
                  description: The artists who performed the track. Each artist object includes a link in href to more detailed information about the artist.
                  items:
                    uri:
                      type: string
                      description: The Spotify URI for the artist.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.uri)==37

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items.artists" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 198745 examples in the requests data, with 204 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.items.artists.uri=spotify:artist:4utLUGcTvOJFr6aqIJtYWV
return.items.artists.uri=spotify:artist:2NhdGz9EDv2FeUw6udu2g1
return.items.artists.uri=spotify:artist:1WjexdTcXHgvlVIPCE8D1Q
return.items.artists.uri=spotify:artist:63MQldklfxkjYDoUE4Tppz
return.items.artists.uri=spotify:artist:3MhnTc9AODdRGMrtntEqIz

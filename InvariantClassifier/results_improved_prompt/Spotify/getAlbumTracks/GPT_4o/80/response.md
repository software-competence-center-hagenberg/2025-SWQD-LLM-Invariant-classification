### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is designed to retrieve the tracks of a specific album from Spotify. The response schema includes an array of `items`, where each item represents a track. Each track item has two properties:
- `type`: A string that describes the object type, which is always 'track'.
- `uri`: A string that provides the Spotify URI for the track.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.type` is a substring of `return.uri`.

### Analysis

1. **Understanding the URI Format**: The Spotify URI for a track typically follows the format `spotify:track:<track_id>`. This format inherently includes the substring `track` after the `spotify:` prefix.

2. **Type Field**: The `type` field is explicitly described as 'track' for each item in the response. This aligns with the substring 'track' found in the URI.

3. **Number of Calls and Examples**: With 10,000 API calls and 164,046 examples (1,956 distinct), no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong correlation between the `type` field and its presence as a substring in the `uri`.

4. **Semantic Consistency**: The semantic meaning of the `type` field ('track') is consistent with its expected presence in the URI format (`spotify:track:<track_id>`).

### Conclusion

Given the consistent format of Spotify URIs and the definition of the `type` field, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant `return.type` is a substring of `return.uri` is a "true-positive". The invariant holds true across all tested examples and aligns with the expected structure of the data returned by the API.

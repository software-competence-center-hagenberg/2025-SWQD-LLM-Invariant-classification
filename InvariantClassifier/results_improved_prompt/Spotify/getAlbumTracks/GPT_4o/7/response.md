### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is used to retrieve tracks from a specific album. The response includes an array of items, each of which has a property `is_local` that is a boolean indicating whether the track is local.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.is_local == false`, which suggests that for every track returned by this endpoint, the `is_local` property is always `false`.

### Analysis
- **Data Analysis**: We have 10,000 calls to this API, and in all these calls, the `is_local` property was always `false`. This suggests a strong pattern or rule that tracks retrieved from this endpoint are not local.
- **Distinct Examples**: Out of 164,046 examples, only 1 distinct example was found, which consistently showed `is_local=false`. This further supports the invariant.
- **Swagger Documentation**: The documentation does not specify any constraints or variations for the `is_local` property. It simply describes it as a boolean indicating if the track is local.
- **Semantic Consideration**: The `is_local` property is meant to indicate whether a track is local. The absence of `true` values in a large sample size suggests that the API might not return local tracks, or the feature is not used in the current dataset.

### Conclusion
Given the large number of calls and consistent results, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant `return.is_local == false` is a "true-positive". However, without explicit documentation stating that `is_local` can never be `true`, there remains a slight possibility that this invariant might not hold in all scenarios, such as different datasets or future API updates.

**Confidence**: 0.9 (High confidence due to extensive testing and consistent results, but slight uncertainty due to lack of explicit documentation).

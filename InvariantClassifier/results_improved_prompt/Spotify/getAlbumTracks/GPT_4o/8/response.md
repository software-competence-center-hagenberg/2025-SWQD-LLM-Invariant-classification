### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is designed to retrieve the tracks of a specific album. According to the Swagger definition, the response includes an array of `items`, each potentially containing a `linked_from` object. This `linked_from` object is described as part of the response when Track Relinking is applied, and it includes a property `type` which is described as "The object type: 'track'."

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.linked_from.type == "track"`.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Specification**: The Swagger documentation explicitly states that the `type` property within `linked_from` is "The object type: 'track'." This suggests that the only expected value for `type` is "track".

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 2,756 examples were observed, all of which had the `type` value as "track". This strong empirical evidence supports the invariant.

3. **Semantic Consistency**: The semantic meaning of `linked_from.type` being "track" aligns with the purpose of the `linked_from` object, which is to provide information about a track that has been replaced. It makes sense that the type would consistently be "track" in this context.

4. **Lack of Contradictory Evidence**: There is no indication in the Swagger documentation or the empirical data that `linked_from.type` could take on any other value.

### Conclusion
Given the explicit description in the Swagger documentation, the strong empirical evidence from 10,000 calls, and the semantic consistency of the invariant, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant accurately reflects the expected behavior of the API as described and observed.

**Verdict**: True-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is designed to retrieve the tracks of a specific album from Spotify. The response includes a `href` which is a URL to the Web API endpoint for the full result, and `items` which is an array containing track information. Each track may have a `linked_from` object if track relinking is applied, which includes an `id` for the track.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.linked_from.id` is a substring of `return.linked_from.href`. This implies that the track ID should appear within the URL provided in `href`.

### Analysis
- **Data Analysis**: With 10,000 calls and 164,046 examples, including 1,736 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant, there is strong empirical evidence for the invariant.
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `href` is a URL that likely includes the track ID as part of the endpoint path, which is common in RESTful API design. The examples provided show that the `id` is indeed a substring of the `href`, as the `href` follows the pattern `https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/{id}`.
- **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not contradict this invariant. It is reasonable to expect the track ID to be part of the URL, as URLs often include resource identifiers.

### Conclusion
Given the strong empirical evidence and the reasonable expectation based on RESTful API design principles, this invariant is highly likely to be a "true-positive". The track ID being a substring of the track URL is consistent with typical API design and the provided data.

**Confidence**: 0.95

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is used to retrieve the tracks of a specific album from Spotify. The response schema includes an `items` array, where each item represents a track. Each track has a `track_number` property, which is described as "The number of the track. If an album has several discs, the track number is the number on the specified disc."

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.track_number >= 1`. This invariant suggests that the track number for any track in an album is always greater than or equal to 1.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Understanding**: The `track_number` represents the position of a track on a disc. In typical scenarios, track numbers start from 1, as there is no track number 0 or negative track numbers on a disc.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 164,046 examples were observed, with 37 distinct track numbers, all of which are greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The swagger definition does not mention any possibility of a track number being less than 1. It aligns with the common understanding of how track numbers are assigned.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic understanding of track numbers, the empirical evidence from a large number of calls, and the lack of any specification indicating otherwise, the invariant `return.track_number >= 1` is a "true-positive". It is highly likely that track numbers will always start from 1 and not include 0 or negative numbers.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes a REST API endpoint for retrieving tracks from an album on Spotify. The relevant part of the response schema is:

- **items**: An array containing the requested data.
  - **available_markets**: An array of strings, each representing a country where the track is available, using ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

- **Invariant**: All the elements of `return.available_markets[]` have LENGTH=2

This invariant suggests that every string in the `available_markets` array has a fixed length of 2 characters.

### Analysis

1. **ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 Codes**: The description in the Swagger definition specifies that the `available_markets` array contains country codes in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format. By definition, these codes are two-letter country codes, which aligns perfectly with the invariant that all elements have a length of 2.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 81,695 examples were observed, with 17 distinct examples, all conforming to the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The invariant is consistent with the specification provided in the Swagger definition, which explicitly states that the codes are ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes, inherently having a length of 2.

### Conclusion

Given the alignment of the invariant with the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code specification, the extensive empirical evidence supporting the invariant, and the lack of any counterexamples, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive." The invariant is consistent with both the specification and the observed data.

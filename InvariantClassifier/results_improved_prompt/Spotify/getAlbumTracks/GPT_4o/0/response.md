### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is used to retrieve the tracks of a specific album. The response for a successful request (HTTP 200) includes an object with a property `items`, which is an array. Each item in this array represents a track and contains an `artists` array. Each artist object within this array has a property `external_urls`, which is an object containing known external URLs for the artist.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.external_urls != null`. This suggests that for every artist object within the `items` array of the response, the `external_urls` property is never null.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The specification indicates that `external_urls` is a property of the artist object, but it does not explicitly state whether this property is mandatory or optional. However, given that it is described as "Known external URLs for this artist," it implies that this field is expected to contain data if available.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

3. **Semantic Reasoning**: The `external_urls` property is likely to be non-null in most cases because artists typically have external links (e.g., to their official website, social media, etc.).

4. **Potential Edge Cases**: While the invariant holds for the tested cases, there might be edge cases where an artist does not have any external URLs, especially for lesser-known or new artists. However, the lack of counterexamples in a large number of tests suggests that such cases are either rare or handled differently (e.g., by omitting the artist from the list).

### Conclusion

Given the empirical evidence from 10,000 calls and the reasonable expectation that artists generally have external URLs, the invariant `return.external_urls != null` is likely a "true-positive." However, there is a slight possibility of edge cases not covered in the tests, but these seem to be rare or non-existent in the current dataset.

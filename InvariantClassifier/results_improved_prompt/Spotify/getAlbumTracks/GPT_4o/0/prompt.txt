Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/albums/{id}/tracks"
  get:
    description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                artists:
                  type: array
                  description: The artists who performed the track. Each artist object includes a link in href to more detailed information about the artist.
                  items:
                    external_urls:
                      type: object
                      description: Known external URLs for this artist.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.external_urls != null

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.NonZero
Invariant description: Represents long scalars that are non-zero. Prints as x != 0, or as x != null for pointer types.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items.artists" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

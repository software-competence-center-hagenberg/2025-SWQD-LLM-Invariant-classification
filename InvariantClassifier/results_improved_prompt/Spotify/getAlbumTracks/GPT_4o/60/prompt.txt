Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/albums/{id}/tracks"
  get:
    description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            href:
              type: string
              description: A link to the Web API endpoint returning the full result of the request.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.linked_from.href is Url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsUrl
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable is always a URL. Represented as x is Url.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 2756 examples in the requests data, with 199 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.items.linked_from.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/386RUes7n1uM1yfzgeUuwp
return.items.linked_from.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/7cCdii7CzKmx05XQK1EbkW
return.items.linked_from.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/1RM2bfyAifL5CZkDYVpSwi

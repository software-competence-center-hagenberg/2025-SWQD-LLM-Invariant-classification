Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.type is a substring of return.uri

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString
Invariant description: Represents the substring invariant between two String scalars. Prints as x is a substring of y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items.artists" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 198745 examples in the requests data, with 204 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.items.artists.type=artist; return.items.artists.uri=spotify:artist:5HOu40y4JzaPi68Juxb7gF
return.items.artists.type=artist; return.items.artists.uri=spotify:artist:0xgLzYXTSX00BF1UpyXQpi
return.items.artists.type=artist; return.items.artists.uri=spotify:artist:0EmeFodog0BfCgMzAIvKQp
return.items.artists.type=artist; return.items.artists.uri=spotify:artist:4cOY0iUSp0UERCk4I23uoH

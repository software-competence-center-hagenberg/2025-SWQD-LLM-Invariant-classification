### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is used to retrieve the tracks of a specific album from Spotify. The response includes an array of items, each potentially containing a `linked_from` object. This object is relevant when track relinking is applied, indicating that the track has been replaced with a different one. The `linked_from` object contains properties such as `type` and `uri`, where `type` is described as "The object type: 'track'" and `uri` is "The Spotify URI for the track."

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.linked_from.type` is a substring of `return.linked_from.uri`. Specifically, it checks if the string value of `type` is contained within the string value of `uri`.

### Analysis
- **Data Analysis**: We have 10,000 calls with no counterexamples found, and 164,046 examples of the invariant holding, with 1,736 distinct examples. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `type` field is always 'track', according to the specification. The `uri` field is a Spotify URI, which typically includes the type of object (e.g., 'track') as part of its structure (e.g., `spotify:track:<id>`). Thus, it makes semantic sense that 'track' would be a substring of the URI.
- **Specification Consistency**: The specification explicitly states that the `type` is 'track', which aligns with the observed data where 'track' is a substring of the URI.

### Conclusion
Given the empirical evidence from a large number of calls and the semantic consistency with the specification, this invariant is highly likely to be a "true-positive". The structure of Spotify URIs naturally includes the type of object, which in this case is 'track', making it a substring of the URI.

### Confidence
The confidence in this classification is very high due to the large number of examples and the clear alignment with the specification.

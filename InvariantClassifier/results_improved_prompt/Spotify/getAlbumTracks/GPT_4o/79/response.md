### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is used to retrieve tracks from a specific album on Spotify. The response includes an array of items, each representing a track. Each track item can have a `linked_from` object, which is used when track relinking is applied. This object contains a `uri` field, which is a string representing the Spotify URI for the track. Additionally, each track item has a `type` field, which is described as the object type and is expected to be 'track'.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.type` is a substring of `return.linked_from.uri`. This means that the string value of the `type` field should appear somewhere within the `uri` string.

### Analysis
- **Data Analysis**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. There were 2,756 examples supporting the invariant, with 199 distinct examples.
- **Example Values**: The examples provided show that the `uri` field always contains the string 'track', which matches the value of the `type` field.
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `type` field is described as the object type, which is 'track'. The `uri` field is a Spotify URI, which consistently includes the string 'track' as part of its format (`spotify:track:<id>`). This format suggests that the invariant is not coincidental but rather a result of the URI structure.

### Conclusion
Given the consistent format of Spotify URIs and the fact that the `type` field is expected to be 'track', it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant holds true for all valid requests. The URI format inherently includes the `type` value as a substring, making the invariant a logical consequence of the API's design.

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive** with high confidence.

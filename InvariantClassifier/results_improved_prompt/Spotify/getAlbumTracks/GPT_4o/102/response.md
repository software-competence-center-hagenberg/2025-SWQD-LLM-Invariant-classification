### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is used to retrieve tracks from a specific album on Spotify. The response includes a property `limit`, which is described as "The maximum number of items in the response (as set in the query or by default)." This implies that `limit` is a parameter that controls the number of tracks returned in the response.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.limit >= 1`. This suggests that the `limit` value in the response is always at least 1.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Definition Context**: The `limit` parameter is described as the maximum number of items in the response. Typically, a `limit` parameter in APIs is used to control pagination and the number of items returned per page. It is common for such parameters to have a minimum value of 1, as returning 0 items would not be useful in most contexts.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

3. **Example Values**: The example values provided (46, 47, 44, 45, 48) are all greater than 1, supporting the invariant.

4. **Common API Practices**: In REST APIs, especially those dealing with lists or collections, it is a common practice to have a minimum limit of 1 to ensure that at least one item is returned if available.

5. **Specification Ambiguity**: The specification does not explicitly state that `limit` can be 0 or negative, which would contradict the invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the empirical evidence from 10,000 calls without counterexamples, the common practice of having a minimum limit of 1 in APIs, and the lack of specification details contradicting the invariant, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant `return.limit >= 1` is a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the strong empirical support and alignment with typical API design practices.

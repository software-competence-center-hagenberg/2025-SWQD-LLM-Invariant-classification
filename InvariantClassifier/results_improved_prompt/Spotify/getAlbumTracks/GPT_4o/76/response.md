### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is designed to retrieve tracks from a specific album. The response includes an array of items, each potentially containing a `linked_from` object. This object is relevant when track relinking occurs, and it includes properties such as `id` and `uri`.

- `linked_from.id`: A string representing the Spotify ID for the track.
- `linked_from.uri`: A string representing the Spotify URI for the track.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.linked_from.id` is a substring of `return.linked_from.uri`.

### Analysis
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, yielding 164,046 examples, with 1,736 distinct examples, and no counterexamples were found.
- **Example Values**: The examples provided show that the `id` is indeed a substring of the `uri`, which is consistent with the format of Spotify URIs, where the URI typically includes the ID as part of its structure (e.g., `spotify:track:{id}`).
- **Semantic Consistency**: Given the structure of Spotify URIs, it is expected that the track ID would be part of the URI, making the invariant semantically sensible.

### Conclusion
The invariant that `return.linked_from.id` is a substring of `return.linked_from.uri` is consistent with the expected format of Spotify URIs. The extensive empirical evidence without any counterexamples further supports this invariant. Therefore, it is highly likely to be a true-positive.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/albums/{id}/tracks"
  get:
    description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            href:
              type: string
              description: A link to the Web API endpoint returning the full result of the request.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.href is Url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsUrl
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable is always a URL. Represented as x is Url.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items.artists" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 198745 examples in the requests data, with 204 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.items.artists.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/0jJszR81GjA87jeRq0Jgwz
return.items.artists.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/2vhqxD07xr1Agkb3ieUarL
return.items.artists.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/0EmeFodog0BfCgMzAIvKQp

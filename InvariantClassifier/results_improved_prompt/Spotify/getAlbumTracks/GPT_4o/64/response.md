### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` is designed to retrieve the tracks of a specific album. The response includes an array of items, each containing a `preview_url`, which is a string representing a URL to a 30-second preview of the track.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.preview_url)==107`, which suggests that the length of the `preview_url` string is always 107 characters.

### Analysis
- **Number of Calls and Examples:** The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 125,786 examples with 2,652 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.
- **Example Values:** The example URLs provided all have a consistent structure and length, supporting the invariant.
- **URL Structure:** The URLs follow a pattern that includes a base URL, a unique identifier, and a query parameter (`cid`). This structure can lead to a consistent length if the components of the URL are fixed in length.
- **Specification:** The swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the length of `preview_url`, but the consistent pattern in the examples suggests a fixed format.

### Conclusion
Given the large number of examples and the absence of counterexamples, along with the consistent pattern observed in the URLs, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant is a "true-positive." The fixed length likely results from a consistent URL structure used by the API.

**Verdict:** True-positive
**Confidence:** 0.95

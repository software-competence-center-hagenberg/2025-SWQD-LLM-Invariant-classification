## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve an album's tracks from the Spotify API.
- The response schema includes a field 'is_local' of type boolean, which represents whether the track is local.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.is_local == false', which means that the 'is_local' field in the response should always be false.

## Analysis
- The invariant is a unary scalar invariant, which checks if a single variable takes on a specific value.
- The invariant has been tested with 10000 calls, and no counterexamples have been found.
- There are 164046 examples in the requests data, with 1 distinct example of the invariant holding.
- The example value provided is 'return.items.is_local=false', which supports the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the example values, it is highly likely that the invariant 'return.is_local == false' is a true-positive for the Spotify API. The response 'is_local' field consistently holds the value false, and there is strong evidence to support the correctness of the invariant.

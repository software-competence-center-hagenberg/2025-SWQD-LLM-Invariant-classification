## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a GET endpoint for retrieving an album's tracks with a 'limit' query parameter.
- The 'limit' parameter is defined as an integer with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum length of 50.
- The response schema includes an 'items' array, which contains properties for each track.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the 'limit' parameter in the request should be greater than or equal to the size of the 'items' array in the response.

## Analysis
- The 'limit' parameter in the request controls the maximum number of items to return, and it makes sense that it should be greater than or equal to the size of the 'items' array in the response.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any other constraints on the 'limit' parameter, and the invariant aligns with the intended behavior of the API.
- The fact that 5236 examples were found in the requests data, with 4020 of them being distinct examples, provides strong evidence in support of the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

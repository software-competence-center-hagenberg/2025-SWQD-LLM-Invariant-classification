## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/albums/{id}/tracks' returns a response with a 'duration_ms' field and an 'artists' array.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.duration_ms > size(return.artists[])
This means that the duration of a track should be greater than the number of artists who performed the track.

## Analysis
Based on the Swagger definition and the nature of the data, it is unlikely that the duration of a track would always be greater than the number of artists. It is possible for a track to have a longer duration and still have multiple artists performing it. Therefore, this invariant seems to be a false-positive.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a false-positive with a confidence of 0.9.

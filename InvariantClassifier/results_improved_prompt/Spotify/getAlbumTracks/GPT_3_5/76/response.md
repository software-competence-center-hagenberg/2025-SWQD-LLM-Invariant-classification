## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/albums/{id}/tracks' returns a list of tracks for a given album.
- The response contains an array of items, each with a linked_from object that includes an id and a uri.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.linked_from.id is a substring of return.linked_from.uri

## Analysis
The invariant states that the id of the linked track is a substring of the URI of the linked track. Given the nature of Spotify track IDs and URIs, it is highly likely that the ID is a substring of the URI. This is supported by the 10000 calls made to the API, which did not find a single counterexample. Additionally, the 164046 examples in the requests data, with 1736 distinct examples, further support the likelihood of this invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive.

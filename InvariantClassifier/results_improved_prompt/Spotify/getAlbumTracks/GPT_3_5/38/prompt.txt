Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/albums/{id}/tracks"
  get:
    description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
    parameters:
      - name: limit
        in: query
        description: The maximum number of items to return
        type: integer
        minimum: 0
        maxLength: 50
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            offset:
              type: integer
              description: The offset of the items returned (as set in the query or by default).


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.limit != return.offset

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two long scalars. Prints as x != y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 87 examples in the requests data, with 47 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.limit=33; return.offset=12
input.limit=46; return.offset=13
input.limit=41; return.offset=0
input.limit=43; return.offset=14
input.limit=9; return.offset=0

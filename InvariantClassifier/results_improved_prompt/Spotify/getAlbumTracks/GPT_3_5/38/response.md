## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/albums/{id}/tracks' has a GET operation with a 'limit' query parameter and a '200' response containing an 'offset' field.

## Invariant
The invariant is that input.limit != return.offset.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'limit' query parameter is used to specify the maximum number of items to return, and the 'offset' field in the response represents the offset of the items returned. These two values are not directly related, and it is possible for them to be different.

Given that 100 calls were made to the API and no counterexamples were found, and there were 87 examples in the requests data with 47 distinct examples, it is highly likely that the invariant holds true for this API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

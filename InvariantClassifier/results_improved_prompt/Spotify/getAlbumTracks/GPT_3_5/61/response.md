## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition provided describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an album's tracks from the Spotify API. The response schema includes a field 'linked_from' which contains information about the originally requested track, including the 'id' field.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the length of the 'id' in the 'linked_from' object is always 22 characters.

## Analysis
Based on the provided information, the 'id' field in the 'linked_from' object is described as the Spotify ID for the track. The invariant states that this ID should always have a fixed length of 22 characters. The sample data provided includes 199 distinct examples of the 'id' field, and all of them have a length of 22 characters. Additionally, 10000 calls were made to the API, and no counterexamples were found.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The sample data and the extensive testing provide strong evidence that the length of the 'id' in the 'linked_from' object is indeed always 22 characters.

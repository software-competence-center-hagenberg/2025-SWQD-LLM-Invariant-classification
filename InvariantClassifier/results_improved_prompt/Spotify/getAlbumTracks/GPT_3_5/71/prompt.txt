    parameters:
    responses:

        schema:
          type: object
          properties:

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.type is a substring of return.href

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString

Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 164046 examples in the requests data, with 1956 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.items.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/7hiBhOh4s8G0xmGYBAjyuw; return.items.type=track

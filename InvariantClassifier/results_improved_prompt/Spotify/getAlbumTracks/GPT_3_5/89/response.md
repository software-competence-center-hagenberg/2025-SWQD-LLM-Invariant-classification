## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to retrieve an album's tracks, with a query parameter 'market' that represents an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.
- The response contains a field 'previous' which is a URL to the previous page of items.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.market is a substring of return.previous

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 2658 examples in the requests data, with 2244 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the 'input.market' value is indeed a substring of the 'return.previous' value in each case.
- The 'input.market' values are ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes, and they are present as substrings in the 'return.previous' URLs.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the format of the 'return.previous' URLs, so the invariant does not contradict the specification.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, it is highly likely that the invariant 'input.market is a substring of return.previous' is a true-positive for this REST API endpoint.

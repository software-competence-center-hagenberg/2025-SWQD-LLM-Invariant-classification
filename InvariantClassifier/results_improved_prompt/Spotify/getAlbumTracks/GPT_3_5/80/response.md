## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an album's tracks from the Spotify API.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a type and a uri.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the return type is a substring of the return uri.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- We found 164046 examples in the requests data, with 1956 of them being distinct examples.
- The example values provided also support the invariant.
- The invariant makes sense in the context of the response schema, as the type is a substring of the uri for each track.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the semantic coherence of the invariant with the response schema, the invariant is classified as a true-positive.

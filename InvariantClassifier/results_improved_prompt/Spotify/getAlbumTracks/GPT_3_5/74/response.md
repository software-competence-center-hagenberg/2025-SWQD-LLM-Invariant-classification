## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/albums/{id}/tracks' returns a response with a 'items' array, each containing a 'linked_from' object with 'type' and 'href' properties.
- The 'type' property is a string representing the object type, and the 'href' property is a string representing a link to the Web API endpoint.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the 'type' property in the 'linked_from' object is a substring of the 'href' property.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the nature of the 'type' and 'href' properties, it is reasonable to expect that the 'type' property would be a substring of the 'href' property. The 'type' property represents the type of the object, and it is likely that this type would be included in the URL of the object.

## Conclusion
Given the nature of the properties and the large number of examples with no counterexamples, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive.

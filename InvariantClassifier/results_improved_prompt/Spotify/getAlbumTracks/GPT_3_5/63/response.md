## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provided describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an album's tracks from the Spotify API. The response schema includes a field called `linked_from` which contains a property `uri` representing the Spotify URI for the track.

## Invariant
The invariant is a unary string invariant of the form LENGTH(return.linked_from.uri)==36, indicating that the length of the `uri` in the `linked_from` object is always 36 characters.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the nature of Spotify URIs, it is highly likely that the Spotify URI for a track is always 36 characters in length. The examples provided are consistent with this invariant, and the large number of calls made (10000) with no counterexamples further supports the likelihood of this invariant being true.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a true-positive with high confidence, as the examples and the nature of the data strongly support the correctness of the invariant.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about the REST endpoint for getting an album's tracks.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a duration_ms field and a track_number field.

## Invariant
The invariant is that return.duration_ms > return.track_number, where return refers to the fields in the response body.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample for the invariant.
- We found 164046 examples in the requests data, with 1768 of them being distinct examples.
- The example values of the variables support the invariant, as the duration_ms values are consistently greater than the track_number values.
- The invariant makes semantic sense in the context of an album's tracks, as the duration of a track is expected to be greater than the track number.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the semantic relevance of the invariant, it is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/albums/{id}/tracks' has a GET operation with a 'limit' query parameter and a response schema containing 'duration_ms' for each track.

## Invariant
- The invariant is input.limit < return.duration_ms, which states that the 'limit' parameter in the request should be less than the 'duration_ms' of the returned tracks.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 85750 examples in the requests data, with 40977 distinct examples.
- The examples demonstrate that the 'limit' parameter is consistently less than the 'duration_ms' of the returned tracks.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the relationship between 'limit' and 'duration_ms', and the examples cover a wide range of values for both variables.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, along with the lack of explicit constraints in the specification, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/albums/{id}/tracks"
  get:
    description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            href:
              type: string
              description: A link to the Web API endpoint returning the full result of the request.
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                linked_from:
                  type: object
                  description: Part of the response when Track Relinking is applied, and the requested track has been replaced with different track. The track in the linked_from object contains information about the originally requested track.
                  properties:
                    type:
                      type: string
                      description: The object type: 'track'.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.linked_from.type is a substring of return.href

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString
Invariant description: Represents the substring invariant between two String scalars. Prints as x is a substring of y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 2756 examples in the requests data, with 240 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.items.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/4myw5vqolENzVKqDzKbJgM; return.items.linked_from.type=track
return.items.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/4zqBly8rAwy5C8iGA7LJP0; return.items.linked_from.type=track
return.items.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/5Oj3j0oqHPbK4KdizrFLP6; return.items.linked_from.type=track

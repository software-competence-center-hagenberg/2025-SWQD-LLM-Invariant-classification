## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/albums/{id}/tracks' has a GET operation that returns a list of tracks for a given album.
- The response schema includes a 'href' field of type string and an 'items' field of type array, which contains 'linked_from' objects with a 'type' field of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant is that 'return.items.linked_from.type' is a substring of 'return.items.href'.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 2756 examples in the requests data, with 240 of them being distinct examples.
- The example values of the variables show that the 'linked_from.type' values are indeed substrings of the 'href' values.
- The invariant is consistent with the response schema and the example values found in the requests data.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

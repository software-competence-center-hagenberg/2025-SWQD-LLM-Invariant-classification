## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provided describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an album's tracks. The response schema includes a field 'items' which is an array of objects, each containing an 'external_urls' field.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.external_urls != null' checks if the 'external_urls' field in the response is not null.

## Analysis
Based on the provided swagger definition and the invariant, it is highly likely that the 'external_urls' field in the response will not be null. This is because the 'external_urls' field is described as 'Known external URLs for this track', indicating that it is expected to have a value. Additionally, the fact that 10000 calls were made on the API without finding a single counter example strongly supports the likelihood of this invariant being true.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, it is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

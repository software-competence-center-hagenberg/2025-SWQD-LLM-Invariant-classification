### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve albums for a specific artist. The response includes an array of `items`, each representing an album. Each album has a property `available_markets`, which is an array of strings. These strings are ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes indicating the markets where the album is available.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `size(return.available_markets[]) >= 1`, which implies that for every album returned, there is at least one market where the album is available.

### Analysis
1. **Specification Alignment**: The swagger definition states that `available_markets` lists the markets where the album is available. It also mentions that an album is considered available in a market if at least one track is available in that market. This implies that if an album is returned, it should logically have at least one market listed in `available_markets`.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 81,608 examples were observed, with 1,161 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.

3. **Logical Consistency**: Given the definition, it would be unusual for an album to be returned with an empty `available_markets` array, as this would contradict the purpose of the array, which is to list markets where the album is available.

### Conclusion
The invariant `size(return.available_markets[]) >= 1` is consistent with the API's purpose and the observed data. The swagger definition supports the idea that an album should have at least one available market if it is returned in the response. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a "true-positive" with high confidence.

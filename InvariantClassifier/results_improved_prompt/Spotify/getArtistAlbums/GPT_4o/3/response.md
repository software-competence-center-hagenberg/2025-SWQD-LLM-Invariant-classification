### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` which returns a list of albums for a given artist. Each album has an array of images, and each image has a `height` property. The `height` is described as an integer representing the image height in pixels, and it can be `null` or not returned if unknown.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is that the `height` of images in the response is one of the values {64, 300, 640}.

### Analysis

1. **Data from Calls**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong pattern in the data.
2. **Distinct Values**: Out of 554,566 examples, only 3 distinct values were observed, which are exactly the values mentioned in the invariant.
3. **Specification**: The specification does not explicitly mention the possible values for `height`, but it does allow for `null` or not returned if unknown. However, in practice, the observed values are consistent with the invariant.
4. **Common Image Sizes**: The values 64, 300, and 640 are common image sizes used in web applications, particularly for responsive design, which aligns with the invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the large number of examples and the absence of counterexamples, along with the commonality of these image sizes in web applications, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is a "true-positive". The specification does not contradict this invariant, and the data strongly supports it.

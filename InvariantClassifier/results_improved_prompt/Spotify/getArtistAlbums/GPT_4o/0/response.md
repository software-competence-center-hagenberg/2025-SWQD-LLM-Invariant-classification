### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is used to retrieve albums for a specific artist. The response is expected to be an object containing an array of `items`, where each item represents an artist. Each artist item contains an `external_urls` object, which holds known external URLs for the artist.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.external_urls != null`, which implies that for every artist item in the response, the `external_urls` field is not null.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Specification:** The specification describes `external_urls` as an object containing known external URLs for the artist. It does not explicitly state that this field can be null.
2. **Empirical Evidence:** The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.
3. **Semantic Reasoning:** It is reasonable to expect that every artist would have at least one external URL, such as a link to their Spotify profile or other social media accounts. This aligns with the invariant that `external_urls` should not be null.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of counterexamples after extensive testing and the reasonable expectation that artists would have external URLs, the invariant `return.external_urls != null` is likely a true-positive. The specification does not contradict this invariant, and the semantic reasoning supports it.

**Verdict:** True-positive
**Confidence:** 0.95

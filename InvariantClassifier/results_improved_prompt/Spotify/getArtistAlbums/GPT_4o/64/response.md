### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve albums for a specific artist. The response schema includes an `items` array, where each item has an `available_markets` field. This field is an array of strings, each representing a market where the album is available. The description specifies that these are ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that all elements of `return.available_markets[]` have a length of 2.

### Analysis
1. **ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 Codes**: These are standardized country codes that are exactly two characters long. This aligns perfectly with the invariant that all elements have a length of 2.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, yielding 94,565 examples, and no counterexamples were found. This extensive testing supports the invariant.
3. **Distinct Examples**: With 1,161 distinct examples, the invariant holds across a wide variety of data, further reinforcing its validity.
4. **Example Values**: The provided example values such as `"AR"`, `"ES"`, `"MX"`, etc., are all two-character strings, consistent with ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes.

### Conclusion
The invariant that all elements of `return.available_markets[]` have a length of 2 is consistent with the specification of using ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes. Given the extensive testing and the nature of the data, this invariant is highly likely to be a true-positive.

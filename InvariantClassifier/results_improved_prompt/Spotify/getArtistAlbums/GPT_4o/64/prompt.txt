    parameters:
    responses:

        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                available_markets:

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.stringsequence.SequenceFixedLengthString

Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve albums for a specific artist. The response schema includes an array of `items`, where each item represents an artist with properties such as `type` and `uri`. The `type` is described as a string indicating the object type, which is 'artist', and the `uri` is a string representing the Spotify URI for the artist.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.type` is a substring of `return.uri`. Specifically, it asserts that the string 'artist' (the value of `return.type`) is always a substring of the `return.uri`.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The `uri` is described as a Spotify URI for the artist, which typically follows the format `spotify:artist:<artist_id>`. This format inherently includes the string 'artist' as part of the URI, making it a substring.

2. **Examples and Data**: We have 10000 calls without a single counterexample and 251423 examples with 3583 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant. The examples provided show URIs that consistently include 'artist' as a substring, which aligns with the expected format of Spotify URIs.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not mention any other possible values for `type` other than 'artist', nor does it suggest any alternative URI formats that would exclude 'artist'.

### Conclusion
Given the consistent format of Spotify URIs and the lack of any counterexamples across a significant number of calls, the invariant that `return.type` ('artist') is a substring of `return.uri` is a logical and expected outcome. The data strongly supports this invariant, and there is no indication from the specification that this would not hold true.

**Verdict**: True-positive

**Confidence**: 0.99

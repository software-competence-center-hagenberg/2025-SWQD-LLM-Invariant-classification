### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve the albums of a specific artist. The response schema includes an array of `items`, each representing an album. Each album has an `images` array, where each image has properties `height` and `width`, which describe the dimensions of the image in pixels. The documentation specifies that these values can be `null` or not returned if unknown.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.height == return.width`, which suggests that for every image returned, the height and width are equal, implying that all images are square.

### Analysis
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested over 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.
- **Distinct Examples**: Out of 554,566 examples, only 3 distinct examples were found, all of which support the invariant (64x64, 300x300, 640x640).
- **Specification**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that images must be square, but it does not contradict the invariant either. The description of the `height` and `width` fields does not imply any specific relationship between them.
- **Semantic Consideration**: In the context of album cover art, it is common for images to be square, as this is a standard format for album covers in many digital music platforms.

### Conclusion
Given the strong empirical evidence and the common practice of using square images for album covers, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a "true-positive". However, since the specification does not explicitly enforce this constraint, there is a slight possibility that non-square images could exist, albeit unlikely given the data.

**Confidence**: 0.9

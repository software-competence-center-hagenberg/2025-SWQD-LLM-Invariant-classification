### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve albums for a specific artist. The response schema includes a `href` property, which is a string that provides a link to the Web API endpoint returning the full result of the request. Additionally, there is an `items` array that contains `artists`, each with a `type` property that is a string and is described as 'artist'.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.type is a substring of return.href`.
- `return.type` refers to the type of the artist, which is always 'artist'.
- `return.href` is a URL string pointing to the artist's endpoint.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `type` field is a constant string 'artist', and the `href` is a URL that includes the word 'artists' as part of its path. This makes it plausible that 'artist' is always a substring of the `href`.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, and there are 251,423 examples supporting it, with 3,583 distinct examples.
3. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not contradict this invariant. The `href` is expected to be a URL related to artists, which aligns with the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic alignment between the `type` being 'artist' and the `href` containing 'artists', along with the extensive empirical evidence supporting the invariant, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant is consistent with the expected structure of the API response and has been thoroughly tested without contradiction.

**Verdict**: true-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

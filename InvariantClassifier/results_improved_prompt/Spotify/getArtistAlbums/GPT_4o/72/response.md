### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve albums for a specific artist. The response schema includes an array of items, each representing an album. Each album has an `id` (a string representing the Spotify ID for the album) and a `uri` (a string representing the Spotify URI for the album).

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.id` is a substring of `return.uri`. This invariant suggests that the album ID is always contained within the album URI.

### Analysis
1. **Data Analysis**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there were 184,868 examples in the request data, with 13,567 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.
2. **Example Values**: The provided example values show that the `id` is indeed a substring of the `uri` in each case:
   - `return.items.id=7ziE9kDKB4QHzIdZnLL899; return.items.uri=spotify:album:7ziE9kDKB4QHzIdZnLL899`
   - `return.items.id=2c3VDcxOoT3J2tXakLb08j; return.items.uri=spotify:album:2c3VDcxOoT3J2tXakLb08j`
   - `return.items.id=0C00ibrtAGw59osJUg5qOO; return.items.uri=spotify:album:0C00ibrtAGw59osJUg5qOO`
   - `return.items.id=5vg5LkPZost7NGm1mcQ2mX; return.items.uri=spotify:album:5vg5LkPZost7NGm1mcQ2mX`
   - `return.items.id=59Qf8zRZswDDDscEQhwSWM; return.items.uri=spotify:album:59Qf8zRZswDDDscEQhwSWM`
3. **Semantic Analysis**: The URI format `spotify:album:{id}` suggests that the ID is embedded within the URI, making it logical for the ID to be a substring of the URI.

### Conclusion
Given the consistent pattern observed in the examples, the logical URI structure, and the absence of counterexamples after extensive testing, it is highly likely that this invariant is a true-positive. The invariant aligns with the expected format of Spotify URIs, where the ID is a component of the URI.

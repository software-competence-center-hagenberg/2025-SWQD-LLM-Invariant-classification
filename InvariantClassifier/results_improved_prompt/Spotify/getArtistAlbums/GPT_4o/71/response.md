### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve albums for a specific artist. According to the Swagger definition:
- The response includes a `href` property, which is a string representing a link to the Web API endpoint returning the full result of the request.
- The `items` property is an array containing the requested data, where each item has a `type` property that is a string with the description 'The object type: album'.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.type is a substring of return.href`.
- `return.type` refers to the `type` field in the response body, which is expected to be 'album'.
- `return.href` refers to the `href` field in the response body, which is a URL.

### Analysis
- The invariant suggests that the string 'album' (the value of `return.type`) is a substring of the URL in `return.href`.
- The example values provided show that the `href` is a URL of the form `https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/{album_id}`, and the `type` is 'album'.
- The URL structure consistently includes the segment `/albums/`, which contains the substring 'album'.
- Given the URL structure and the consistent use of 'album' as the type, it is logical that 'album' will always be a substring of the `href`.
- The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, and there are 13567 distinct examples supporting the invariant.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.type is a substring of return.href` is highly likely to be a true-positive. The URL structure inherently includes the substring 'album', which matches the `type` value. The extensive testing and lack of counterexamples further support this conclusion.

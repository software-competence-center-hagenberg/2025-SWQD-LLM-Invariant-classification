## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve albums for a specific artist. The response schema indicates that the `items` property is an array containing album data. Each album can have multiple `images`, which are described as cover art images in various sizes. The images are represented as objects with properties `height`, `url`, and `width`.

## Invariant

The invariant in question is `size(return.images[]) == 3`, suggesting that for each album, there are exactly three images provided in the response.

## Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not explicitly state the number of images that should be returned for each album. It only mentions that the images are in various sizes, widest first.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 500 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there were 10009 examples in the request data, with 5087 being distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.

3. **Common Practices**: In many music streaming services, it is common to provide multiple images for different resolutions (e.g., small, medium, large). Three is a typical number for such use cases, aligning with common practices.

4. **Potential Variability**: The specification allows for the possibility of `null` or not returned images if unknown, which could imply variability in the number of images. However, the empirical data strongly supports the invariant.

## Conclusion

Given the strong empirical evidence and the common practice of providing three images for different resolutions, the invariant `size(return.images[]) == 3` is likely a "true-positive". However, the specification's allowance for variability suggests a slight possibility of exceptions, which were not observed in the tested cases.

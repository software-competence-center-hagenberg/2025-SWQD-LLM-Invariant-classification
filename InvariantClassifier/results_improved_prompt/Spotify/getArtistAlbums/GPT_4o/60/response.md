### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve albums for a specific artist on Spotify. The response schema includes an array of `items`, where each item represents an artist with properties such as `id` and `uri`. The `id` is described as the Spotify ID for the artist, and the `uri` is the Spotify URI for the artist.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.id` is a substring of `return.uri`. This invariant suggests that the artist's ID should be found within the artist's URI.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Understanding**: The Spotify URI format for an artist is typically `spotify:artist:{artist_id}`. This format inherently includes the artist's ID as a part of the URI string. Therefore, it makes semantic sense for the `id` to be a substring of the `uri`.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 251,423 examples were observed, with 3,583 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not provide any alternative format for the URI that would exclude the ID. Thus, there is no explicit contradiction in the specification regarding this invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic structure of Spotify URIs, the lack of counterexamples in a large sample size, and the absence of specification contradictions, the invariant is highly likely to be a "true-positive." The artist's ID being a substring of the URI is consistent with the expected format of Spotify URIs.

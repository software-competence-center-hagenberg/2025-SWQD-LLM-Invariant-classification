### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` that retrieves albums of a specific artist. The response schema indicates that the response will be an object containing a property `items`, which is an array. Each item in this array has a property `type`, which is described as a string with the description "The object type: 'album'."

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.type == "album"`.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Description**: The Swagger definition explicitly states that the `type` of each item in the `items` array is described as "The object type: 'album'." This strongly suggests that the `type` field is intended to always have the value "album".

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls to the API, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there were 184,868 examples in the request data, with only one distinct example, which was `return.items.type=album`.

3. **Semantic Consistency**: The semantic meaning of the endpoint is to retrieve albums, and the `type` field is described as indicating the object type. It is consistent with the endpoint's purpose that the `type` would always be "album".

4. **Specification Consistency**: There is no mention in the Swagger definition of any other possible values for the `type` field. The specification does not contradict the invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the explicit description in the Swagger definition, the lack of counterexamples in a large number of tests, and the semantic consistency with the endpoint's purpose, it is highly likely that the invariant `return.type == "album"` is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the intended use and description of the API endpoint.

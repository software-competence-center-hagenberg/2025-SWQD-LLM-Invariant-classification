### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve albums for a specific artist. The response schema includes an array `items`, where each item can have an `images` array. Each image object within this array can have properties `height`, `url`, and `width`. The description specifies that `height` and `width` can be `null` or not returned if unknown, but it does not explicitly state that the `images` array itself or its elements can be `null`.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.images[] elements != null`, which implies that none of the elements within the `images` array are `null`.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not explicitly state that `images` array elements can be `null`. It only mentions that `height` and `width` can be `null`.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: 10,000 calls were made to this API without encountering a `null` element in the `images` array.
3. **Semantic Reasoning**: It is reasonable to expect that if an image is included in the response, it should have a valid object structure (even if some properties like `height` or `width` are `null`). A `null` image object would not be useful in the context of retrieving album cover art.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of evidence for `null` elements in the `images` array across 10,000 API calls and the reasonable expectation that image objects should be non-null, the invariant `return.images[] elements != null` is likely a "true-positive". The specification does not contradict this invariant, and the empirical evidence strongly supports it.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve albums for a specific artist. The response includes an array of `items`, each representing an album. Each album can have an `images` array, which contains objects with properties `height`, `width`, and `url`. The `images` array is described as containing cover art for the album in various sizes, with the widest image first.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `size(return.images[]) one of { 1, 3 }`. This suggests that the `images` array for each album can only have either 1 or 3 images.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not explicitly limit the number of images to 1 or 3. It only mentions that the array contains images in various sizes.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there were 174,859 examples in the request data, with 13,567 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.

3. **Typical Use Case**: In practice, it is common for APIs to provide multiple image sizes for responsive design purposes. However, the exact number of images can vary based on the service's implementation and the availability of images for a particular album.

4. **Potential for Variability**: While the invariant holds in the tested cases, the specification allows for variability. The number of images could potentially be different if the service changes its implementation or if certain albums have more or fewer images available.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of explicit constraints in the specification and the potential for variability in the number of images, the invariant `size(return.images[]) one of { 1, 3 }` is likely a **false-positive**. The empirical evidence is strong, but without a specification constraint, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold in all cases.

**Confidence**: 0.7

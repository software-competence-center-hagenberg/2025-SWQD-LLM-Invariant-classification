### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve an artist's albums. It accepts a query parameter `market`, which is a string representing an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. The response includes a field `previous`, which is a URL string pointing to the previous page of items, or null if there is no previous page.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `input.market` is a substring of `return.previous`.

### Analysis
- **Parameter and Response Relationship**: The `market` parameter is used to filter the albums by market, and it is included in the query string of the `previous` URL. This is evident from the example values provided, where the `market` parameter appears in the `previous` URL.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 2,741 examples supporting the invariant, with 2,342 being distinct.
- **Logical Consistency**: Given the design of the API, it makes sense that the `market` parameter would be included in the `previous` URL to ensure consistency in pagination across different markets.

### Conclusion
The invariant `input.market is a substring of return.previous` is logically consistent with the API's design and behavior as described in the Swagger definition. The extensive empirical evidence further supports the validity of this invariant.

**Verdict**: True-positive

**Confidence**: 0.95

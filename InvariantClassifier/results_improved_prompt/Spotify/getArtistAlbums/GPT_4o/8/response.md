### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve albums for a specific artist. The response schema includes an array of `items`, each representing an album. Each album has a property `external_urls`, which is described as "Known external URLs for this album."

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.external_urls != null`, which implies that for every album returned in the `items` array, the `external_urls` field is not null.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The specification indicates that `external_urls` is a property of each album object. However, it does not explicitly state whether this field is mandatory or optional.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 API calls without encountering a counterexample. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

3. **Semantic Consideration**: The `external_urls` field is likely to be a crucial part of the album data, as it provides links to external resources related to the album. It is reasonable to assume that if an album is listed, it would have associated external URLs.

4. **Potential for Variability**: While the empirical evidence is strong, the lack of explicit specification regarding the optionality of `external_urls` leaves room for potential variability. However, given the nature of the field, it is plausible that it is consistently populated.

### Conclusion

Given the strong empirical evidence from 10,000 calls and the reasonable assumption that `external_urls` is a consistently populated field, the invariant `return.external_urls != null` is likely a "true-positive." However, the lack of explicit specification regarding the optionality of this field introduces a slight degree of uncertainty.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                id:
                  type: string
                  description: The Spotify ID for the album.

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString

The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 184868 examples in the requests data, with 13567 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.items.id=3ziq7zy6hcvNHwAmQkLbzG
return.items.id=4d9hGdYy6PNWbXmwPv6bou
return.items.id=06XUwzsmRFnSflKQy82NRW

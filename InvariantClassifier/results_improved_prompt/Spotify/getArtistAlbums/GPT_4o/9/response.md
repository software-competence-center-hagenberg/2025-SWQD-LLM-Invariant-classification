### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve albums for a specific artist. The response schema includes an `items` array, which contains album data. Each album can have an `images` array, which holds objects representing the cover art for the album. Each image object includes properties such as `height`, `url`, and `width`.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.images != null`, which implies that the `images` array for each album in the `items` array is never null.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Specification:** According to the Swagger definition, the `images` array is described as containing cover art for the album in various sizes. However, there is no explicit mention that this array cannot be null. The description does not specify that every album must have cover art.

2. **Empirical Evidence:** The invariant has been tested with 10,000 API calls without encountering a counterexample. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

3. **Semantic Consideration:** While it is common for albums to have cover art, it is not guaranteed that every album must have it, especially for lesser-known artists or albums that might not have been released with digital cover art. The specification allows for the possibility of `images` being null or not returned, especially if the cover art is unknown.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.images != null` suggests that every album retrieved by this endpoint has at least one image associated with it. However, the Swagger specification does not explicitly guarantee this, and there are plausible scenarios where an album might not have cover art. Despite the lack of counterexamples in 10,000 calls, the invariant is likely a "false-positive" because the specification allows for the possibility of `images` being null or not returned.

**Verdict:** false-positive
**Confidence:** 0.7

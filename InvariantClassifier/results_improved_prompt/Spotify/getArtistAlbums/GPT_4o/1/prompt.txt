Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                artists:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    type:
                      type: string
                      description: The object type: 'artist'


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: "return.type == ""artist"""

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.OneOfString
Invariant description: Represents String variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items.artists" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 251423 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:
return.items.artists.type=artist

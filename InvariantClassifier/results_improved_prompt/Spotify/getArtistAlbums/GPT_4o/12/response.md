### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve albums for a specific artist. The response schema includes an `items` array, which contains objects representing albums. Each album object includes an `artists` array, which contains objects with details about each artist, such as `external_urls`, `href`, `id`, `name`, `type`, and `uri`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.artists != null`, which implies that for every album returned in the `items` array, the `artists` field is not null.

### Analysis

1. **Schema Expectation**: According to the schema, each album object in the `items` array should have an `artists` field. This field is an array, which suggests that it should be present even if it is empty.

2. **Test Results**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds across a wide range of inputs.

3. **Semantic Reasoning**: The `artists` field is crucial for the context of albums, as albums are typically associated with one or more artists. It makes logical sense that this field would always be present and not null, even if it might be an empty array in some cases.

4. **Specification Review**: The specification does not explicitly state that the `artists` field can be null. The description implies that it should always be present, aligning with the invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the schema expectation, the logical necessity of the `artists` field in the context of albums, and the extensive testing without finding counterexamples, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant `return.artists != null` is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of the API as described in the specification and observed in testing.

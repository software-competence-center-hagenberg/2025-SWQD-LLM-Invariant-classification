### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- **Endpoint**: `/artists/{id}/albums`
- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Retrieves albums for a specific artist.
- **Parameters**:
  - `include_groups`: A query parameter that filters the album types. It is an array of strings.
- **Response**:
  - `items`: An array containing album data.
  - `images`: An array of images for each album, with each image having a `height` property.

### Invariant
- **Invariant**: `return.height > size(input.include_groups[])`
- **Type**: Binary invariant comparing two scalar values.
- **Fields**:
  - `input.include_groups[]`: Represents the array of album type filters in the request.
  - `return.items.images.height`: Represents the height of images in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The invariant compares the height of album cover images to the size of the `include_groups` array.
   - Semantically, there is no direct relationship between the number of album types requested and the pixel height of album images.
   - The `include_groups` parameter is used to filter the types of albums returned, not to determine the properties of the images.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 14,121 examples were found, with 192 distinct examples.
   - All examples show the invariant holding, but the lack of a semantic relationship suggests this may be coincidental.

3. **Specification Consideration**:
   - The specification does not suggest any dependency between the `include_groups` array size and the image height.
   - Image heights are likely determined by the source of the images, not by the request parameters.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.height > size(input.include_groups[])` does not make semantic sense given the context of the API. The height of an image should not logically depend on the number of album types requested. Despite the empirical evidence supporting the invariant, the lack of a logical connection and the specification not supporting such a relationship strongly suggest that this is a **false-positive** invariant.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve albums for a specific artist. The response schema includes a property `next`, which is described as a string that contains the URL to the next page of items, or `null` if there are no more pages.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is that `return.next` is always a URL, as indicated by the invariant type `daikon.inv.unary.string.IsUrl`. This means that whenever `return.next` is not `null`, it should be a valid URL.

### Analysis

- **Number of Calls and Examples:** The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Out of 7,198 examples, 5,623 were distinct, all confirming the invariant.
- **Example Values:** The provided example values for `return.next` are all valid URLs pointing to the Spotify API, which aligns with the expected behavior as described in the Swagger definition.
- **Swagger Description:** The description explicitly states that `next` is a URL or `null`. The invariant does not claim that `next` is never `null`, only that when it is not `null`, it is a URL.

### Conclusion

Given the high number of examples and the absence of counterexamples, along with the Swagger definition's description that aligns with the invariant, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant correctly captures the behavior of the `next` field as described in the API documentation.

**Confidence:** 0.95

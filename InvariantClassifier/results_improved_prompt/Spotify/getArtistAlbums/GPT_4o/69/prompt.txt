Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                uri:
                  type: string
                  description: The Spotify URI for the album.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.uri)==36

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString

Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 184868 examples in the requests data, with 13567 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.items.uri=spotify:album:4T4t6X5eZ0ywtQ5fdScj3C
return.items.uri=spotify:album:6epAllIlm3JqCqgUVxxVTe
return.items.uri=spotify:album:7mkyc2BUahNfo0orKzqNGB

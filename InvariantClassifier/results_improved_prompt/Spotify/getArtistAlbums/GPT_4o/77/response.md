### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve albums for a specific artist using their Spotify ID. The `id` parameter is a required string that represents the Spotify ID of the artist. The response includes a `href` field, which is a string containing a link to the Web API endpoint that returns the full result of the request.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `input.id` is a substring of `return.href`.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Relationship**: The `input.id` represents the artist's Spotify ID, and the `return.href` is a URL that includes this ID as part of the path to specify which artist's albums are being requested. It is logical for the `id` to appear in the `href` because the URL is constructed to point to the specific artist's albums.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: With 10,000 calls made and no counterexamples found, along with 11,650 examples supporting the invariant, the empirical evidence strongly supports the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not contradict this invariant. In fact, it aligns with the typical RESTful API design where resource identifiers (like artist IDs) are included in the URL path.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic relationship between the `id` and the `href`, the strong empirical evidence, and the consistency with typical API design patterns, this invariant is likely a true-positive.

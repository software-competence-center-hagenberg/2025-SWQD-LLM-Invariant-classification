### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is used to retrieve albums for a specific artist. The response includes two integer properties:
- `limit`: This represents the maximum number of items that can be returned in the response. This value can be set in the query or defaults to a specific number.
- `total`: This represents the total number of items available to return, which is the total number of albums the artist has.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.limit != return.total`, which suggests that the number of items requested (or the default maximum) is never equal to the total number of items available.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Understanding**: 
   - `limit` is a constraint on the number of items returned in a single API call, while `total` is the total number of items available. 
   - It is logically consistent that `limit` would often not equal `total` because `limit` is typically a smaller number that restricts the response size, whereas `total` is the complete count of items available.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 150 examples were found, with 96 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.
   - Example values show `limit` being less than `total` in all cases, which aligns with typical usage where `limit` is used to paginate results.

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The specification does not explicitly state that `limit` can equal `total`, and given the nature of pagination, it is reasonable to expect that `limit` is often set to a value less than `total`.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic understanding of the API, the empirical evidence from the calls, and the lack of contradiction in the specification, the invariant `return.limit != return.total` is likely a "true-positive". It aligns with the expected behavior of paginated API responses where `limit` is used to control the number of items returned per page, and `total` represents the full count of items.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is designed to retrieve albums for a specific artist. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an array of items, where each item has a `type` and a `uri`. The `type` is described as a string representing the object type, which is 'album'. The `uri` is a string representing the Spotify URI for the album.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.items.type` is a substring of `return.items.uri`.

### Analysis
- **Data Analysis**: We have a substantial amount of data, with 10000 calls and 184868 examples, 13567 of which are distinct. This provides a strong empirical basis for evaluating the invariant.
- **Example Values**: All example values show `return.items.type` as "album" and `return.items.uri` as a string starting with "spotify:album:" followed by an identifier. This suggests that "album" is indeed a substring of the URI in all observed cases.
- **Semantic Analysis**: The URI format "spotify:album:" is consistent with Spotify's URI structure, where the type of the object (in this case, "album") is part of the URI. This makes it semantically reasonable for `return.items.type` to be a substring of `return.items.uri`.
- **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not mention any other possible values for `return.items.type` other than "album", nor does it suggest any alternative URI structures that would contradict the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the strong empirical evidence, the semantic consistency of the invariant with the URI structure, and the lack of any specification details that contradict the invariant, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant logically follows from the structure of the data as described in the specification and observed in the examples.

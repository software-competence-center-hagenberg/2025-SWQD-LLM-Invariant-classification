### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` is used to retrieve albums of a specific artist. The response includes a `limit` property, which is described as "The maximum number of items in the response (as set in the query or by default)." This implies that `limit` is a positive integer that specifies the upper bound on the number of albums returned in the response.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.limit >= 1`. This invariant suggests that the `limit` value in the response is always greater than or equal to 1.

### Analysis
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `limit` parameter is meant to define the maximum number of items returned. It makes logical sense that this number should be at least 1, as a limit of 0 would imply no items can be returned, which is not a practical use case for retrieving albums.
- **Empirical Evidence**: With 10,000 calls made to this endpoint and no counterexamples found, along with 50 distinct examples all supporting the invariant, there is strong empirical evidence supporting the invariant.
- **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not mention any scenario where `limit` could be less than 1. The description implies that `limit` is a positive integer, aligning with the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the logical reasoning, empirical evidence, and lack of contradictory information in the specification, the invariant `return.limit >= 1` is highly likely to be a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of the API as described in the Swagger definition and is supported by extensive testing without counterexamples.

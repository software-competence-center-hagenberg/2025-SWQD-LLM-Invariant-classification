### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an endpoint that retrieves an artist's albums, returning a response that includes an array of items, each containing an array of images. The images are described as objects with properties for height, width, and URL. The description indicates that the images array may not always be present, as it states that the image height and width can be 'null or not returned'.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.images != null`, which implies that the images array should always be present in the response when an artist's albums are retrieved.

### Analysis
Given the description in the Swagger definition, it is possible for the images array to be absent (i.e., not returned) for certain albums. The invariant suggests that the images array will always be present, which contradicts the possibility outlined in the API documentation. Even though 10,000 calls did not yield a counterexample, the specification allows for the absence of the images array, meaning that the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request. 

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.images != null` is a false-positive because the API specification allows for the possibility that the images array may not be returned, thus making the invariant incorrect. The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear contradiction between the invariant and the API documentation.

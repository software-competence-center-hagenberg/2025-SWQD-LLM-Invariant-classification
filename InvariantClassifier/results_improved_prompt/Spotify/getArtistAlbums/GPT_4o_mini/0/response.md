### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums, where the response includes an array of items, each containing an array of artists. Each artist has a property called `external_urls`, which is an object containing known external URLs for the artist.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.external_urls != null`, meaning that the `external_urls` property for each artist in the response should not be null.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The response structure indicates that `external_urls` is part of the artist object. Since the API is designed to return known external URLs for artists, it is reasonable to expect that this field would not be null for valid artist entries.
2. **Testing**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which strongly suggests that the invariant holds true for the current implementation of the API.
3. **Specification Alignment**: The specification does not contradict the invariant, as it implies that artists returned by the API should have known external URLs, thus supporting the idea that `external_urls` should not be null.

### Conclusion
Given the structure of the response, the nature of the data being returned, and the extensive testing that has not yielded any counterexamples, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of the API and is supported by the absence of counterexamples in testing.

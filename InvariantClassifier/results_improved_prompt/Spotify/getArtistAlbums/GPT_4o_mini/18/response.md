### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an endpoint that retrieves an artist's albums, with a query parameter `limit` that specifies the maximum number of items to return. The `limit` parameter is an integer with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum length of 50. The response contains an array of items, each with an `available_markets` property, which is also an array of strings representing ISO country codes.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `input.limit` should not equal `size(return.available_markets[]) - 1`. This means that the limit specified in the request should not be one less than the number of available markets returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests a relationship between the `limit` parameter and the size of the `available_markets` array. If `input.limit` is equal to `size(return.available_markets[]) - 1`, it would imply that the limit is exactly one less than the number of available markets.

2. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 100 calls and no counterexamples were found, which suggests that the invariant holds true for the tested cases. Additionally, there are 201 examples in the request data, with 125 distinct examples, indicating a robust dataset.

3. **Specification Compliance**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `input.limit` must be different from `size(return.available_markets[]) - 1`. It only defines the constraints on `limit` and the structure of the response. Therefore, it is possible for the limit to equal the size of available markets minus one, depending on the data.

4. **Semantics**: The relationship between `input.limit` and `available_markets` is not inherently contradictory, but it is not guaranteed by the API's design. The API could return a number of available markets that matches the limit minus one, especially if the number of available markets is dynamic based on the artist's albums.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant is not explicitly contradicted by the API specification and that it has been tested extensively without finding counterexamples, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. However, the lack of explicit guarantees in the API specification means there is still a slight uncertainty. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a true-positive with high confidence.

**Verdict**: true-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums, where the response contains an array of artists. Each artist object has a 'type' field and a 'uri' field. The 'type' is specified to be a string that indicates the object type, which in this case is 'artist'. The 'uri' is a string that represents the Spotify URI for the artist.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the 'type' of the artist (which is always 'artist') is a substring of the 'uri' of the artist. This is expressed as: `return.type is a substring of return.uri`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Values**: The 'type' field for all examples is consistently 'artist'. The 'uri' field contains values like 'spotify:artist:0rmB1nZVDjwoCN3kQVS7UZ'. The substring check would mean that the string 'artist' should be found within the 'uri'. 
2. **Checking the Examples**: In the provided examples, the 'type' is 'artist', and the 'uri' is of the format 'spotify:artist:<id>'. The string 'artist' does indeed appear as a substring in the 'uri'. 
3. **Generalization**: Since the invariant holds true for all tested cases (10,000 calls with no counterexamples), and given that the 'type' is explicitly defined as 'artist', it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant will hold for all valid responses from the API.
4. **Specification Compliance**: The invariant does not contradict any part of the specification, as the 'type' being 'artist' is consistent with the URI format provided.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant that 'return.type is a substring of return.uri' is a true-positive. It holds for every valid request on the API, as evidenced by the extensive testing and the nature of the data returned by the API.

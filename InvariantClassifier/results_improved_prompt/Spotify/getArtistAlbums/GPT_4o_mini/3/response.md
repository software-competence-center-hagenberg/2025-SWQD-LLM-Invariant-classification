### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that retrieves an artist's albums, including their cover art images. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that the `height` of the images is an integer that can be `null` or not returned if unknown.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `height` of the images can only take on the values {64, 300, 640}. This is a specific restriction on the possible values of the `height` field in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Data Collection**: The invariant has been tested against 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests a strong correlation between the invariant and the actual API behavior.
2. **Distinct Values**: There are only 3 distinct values observed for `height` (64, 300, 640), which aligns with the invariant's claim. However, the specification allows for the possibility of `null` or the field not being returned, which introduces uncertainty.
3. **Specification Consideration**: The specification does not explicitly limit the `height` values to just those three; it allows for `null` or non-returned values, which could imply that other values might be possible in different contexts or under different conditions.

### Conclusion
While the invariant has strong empirical support from the data collected, the allowance for `null` or non-returned values in the specification means that the invariant does not hold universally. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is moderate due to the lack of counterexamples but is tempered by the specification's flexibility regarding the `height` field.

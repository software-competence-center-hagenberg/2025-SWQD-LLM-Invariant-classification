Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
      - name: include_groups
        in: query
        description: Filter by album types
        type: array
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                available_markets:
                  type: array
                  description: The markets in which the album is available: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes. Note that an album is considered available in a market when at least 1 of its tracks is available in that market.
                  items:
                    type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: size(input.include_groups[]) != size(return.available_markets[])-1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two long scalars. Prints as x != y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 500 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 604 examples in the requests data, with 390 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.include_groups=appears_on%2Calbum%2Csingle%2Ccompilation; output.items.available_markets=["AR","BO","BR","CL","CO","CR","EC","ES","GT","HN","MX","NI","PA","PE","PT","PY","SV","UY","VE"]
input.include_groups=single; output.items.available_markets=["ES"]
input.include_groups=appears_on%2Ccompilation; output.items.available_markets=["AR","BO","BR","CL","CO","CR","EC","ES","GT","HN","MX","NI","PA","PE","PT","PY","SV","UY","VE"]
input.include_groups=appears_on%2Ccompilation; output.items.available_markets=["ES"]
input.include_groups=appears_on; output.items.available_markets=["ES"]

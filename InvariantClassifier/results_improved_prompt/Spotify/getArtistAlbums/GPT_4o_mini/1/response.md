### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an endpoint that retrieves an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will include an array of items, where each item contains an array of artists. Each artist object has a property called 'type', which is defined as a string. The description specifies that this 'type' should be 'artist'.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the return type of the artist should always be 'artist'. This is expressed as `return.type == "artist"`. 

### Analysis
Given that the Swagger definition explicitly states that the 'type' of the artist is a string that should represent the object type 'artist', and considering that there have been 10,000 calls made without finding a counterexample, it strongly suggests that the invariant holds true for the API's behavior. Furthermore, the large number of examples (251,423) with only one distinct value ("artist") reinforces the idea that the 'type' field is consistently returning this value.

### Conclusion
Based on the explicit definition in the Swagger documentation and the extensive testing that has shown no counterexamples, the invariant can be classified as a true-positive. The invariant correctly reflects the expected behavior of the API, and the confidence in this classification is very high due to the lack of counterexamples and the clear specification in the API documentation.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an endpoint that retrieves an artist's albums, with a specific focus on the `available_markets` property. This property is an array of strings that represent ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes, which are two-letter country codes.

### Invariant
The invariant states that all elements of `return.available_markets[]` have a length of 2. This is a specific condition that aligns with the expected format of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes.

### Analysis
1. **Specification Compliance**: The specification explicitly states that `available_markets` contains ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes, which are indeed always 2 characters long. Therefore, the invariant is consistent with the specification.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 94,565 examples in the request data, with 1,161 distinct examples, all of which conform to the invariant.
3. **Semantic Relevance**: The invariant is semantically relevant as it directly relates to the expected format of the data returned by the API.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant is supported by the API specification, is consistent with the data observed, and has been tested extensively without finding counterexamples, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. 

Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.95

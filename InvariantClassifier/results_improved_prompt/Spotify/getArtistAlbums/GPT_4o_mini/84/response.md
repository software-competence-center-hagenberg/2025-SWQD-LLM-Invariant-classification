### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that retrieves albums for a specific artist. The response includes an array of items, each of which can contain an array of images. The images can vary in number and dimensions, but the specification does not impose any strict limits on how many images can be included.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `return.images[]` array must be one of {1, 3}. This means that for every valid response from this API, the number of images returned must either be 1 or 3.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The response structure allows for an array of images, but does not specify a maximum or minimum number of images that can be returned. This implies that the number of images could potentially be 0, 2, or any other number, depending on the data available for the albums.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests that in practice, the API may often return either 1 or 3 images. However, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that other values are impossible, especially since the specification does not restrict the number of images.
3. **Specification Contradiction**: Since the specification does not explicitly limit the number of images to just 1 or 3, the invariant is likely too restrictive. The presence of 0 or 2 images is plausible based on the nature of the data.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the number of images to only 1 or 3, while the API specification does not support such a limitation, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear allowance for other values in the API's response structure.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums, with two response properties: `limit` and `offset`. The `limit` indicates the maximum number of items returned, while `offset` indicates the starting point in the collection of items. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.limit >= return.offset`, meaning that the number of items requested (limit) should always be greater than or equal to the starting point (offset). 

### Analysis
1. **Logical Consistency**: The invariant makes logical sense because if you are requesting a certain number of items (`limit`), it should be possible to start from an `offset` that is less than or equal to that limit. For example, if you have an offset of 8 and a limit of 42, it is valid to return items starting from the 8th position up to the 42nd position.
2. **Testing Results**: The invariant has been tested with 50 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests that the invariant holds true for the tested cases. Additionally, the presence of 34 distinct examples strengthens the case for its validity.
3. **Specification Alignment**: The Swagger definition does not contradict the invariant. There are no indications that `offset` can exceed `limit` in the context of this API.

### Conclusion
Given the logical consistency of the invariant, the absence of counterexamples in the testing, and alignment with the API specification, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the thorough testing and reasoning provided.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
      - name: include_groups
        in: query
        description: Filter by album types
        type: array
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                album_group:
                  type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.album_group in input.include_groups[]

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.sequenceString.MemberString
Invariant description: Represents String scalars that are always members of a sequence of String values. Prints as x in y[] where x is a String scalar and y[] is a sequence of String.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 6069 examples in the requests data, with 188 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.include_groups=compilation%2Csingle; output.items.album_group=compilation
input.include_groups=single%2Ccompilation%2Cappears_on%2Calbum; output.items.album_group=single
input.include_groups=single%2Cappears_on%2Calbum; output.items.album_group=appears_on
input.include_groups=album%2Csingle%2Ccompilation%2Cappears_on; output.items.album_group=album
input.include_groups=appears_on%2Ccompilation; output.items.album_group=appears_on

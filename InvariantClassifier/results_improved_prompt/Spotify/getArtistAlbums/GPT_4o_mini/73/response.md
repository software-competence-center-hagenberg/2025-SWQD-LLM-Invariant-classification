### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an endpoint that retrieves an artist's albums. The response contains an array of items, where each item has a 'type' and a 'uri'. The 'type' is specified to be a string that indicates the object type, which is 'album'. The 'uri' is a string that provides the Spotify URI for the album.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the 'type' of the album (which is always 'album') is a substring of the 'uri' of the album. 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The 'type' is always 'album', and the 'uri' follows the format 'spotify:album:{album_id}'. The invariant suggests that 'album' should be a substring of the 'uri'. 
2. **Checking the Examples**: The provided examples show that the 'uri' values are indeed formatted as 'spotify:album:{album_id}', and the string 'album' is present in each of these URIs. 
3. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested against 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, and there are 184,868 examples with 13,567 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant. 
4. **Specification Compliance**: The specification does not contradict this invariant, as the 'type' is consistently 'album' for all items returned by the API.

### Conclusion
Given the consistent results across a large number of calls and examples, and the fact that the invariant aligns with the expected structure of the response, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. The invariant holds true for every valid request on the API, as the 'type' will always be 'album' and will always be a substring of the 'uri'.

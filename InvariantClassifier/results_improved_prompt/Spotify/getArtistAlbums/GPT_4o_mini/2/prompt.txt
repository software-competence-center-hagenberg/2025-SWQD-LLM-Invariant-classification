Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                images:
                  type: array
                  description: The cover art for the album in various sizes, widest first.
                  items:
                    height:
                      type: integer
                      description: The image height in pixels. If unknown: null or not returned.
                  items:
                    width:
                      type: integer
                      description: The image width in pixels. If unknown: null or not returned.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.height == return.width

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two long scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items.images" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 554566 examples in the requests data, with 3 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 3 example values of the variables:
output.items.images.height=640; output.items.images.width=640
output.items.images.height=300; output.items.images.width=300
output.items.images.height=64; output.items.images.width=64

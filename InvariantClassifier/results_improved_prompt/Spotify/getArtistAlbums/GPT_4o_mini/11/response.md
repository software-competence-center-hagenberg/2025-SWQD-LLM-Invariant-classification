### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` returns a response with a schema that includes an `items` property, which is an array of objects. Each object in this array has a `type` property that is described as a string with the value 'album'. This suggests that the expected value for `type` is strictly defined as 'album'.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.type == "album"`, which implies that the `type` field in the returned items will always be 'album'. This is consistent with the Swagger definition, which specifies that the object type is 'album'.

### Analysis
Given that the Swagger definition explicitly states that the `type` of the items is 'album', it aligns with the invariant. Additionally, the testing conducted (10,000 calls without finding a counterexample) strongly supports the validity of this invariant. The fact that there is a large number of examples (184,868) with only one distinct value further reinforces the idea that the `type` is consistently 'album'. 

### Conclusion
Based on the information provided, the invariant is a true-positive because it is supported by the API specification and the extensive testing results. The invariant correctly reflects the expected behavior of the API endpoint, and there is no indication from the specification that other values for `type` are permissible. 

Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.95

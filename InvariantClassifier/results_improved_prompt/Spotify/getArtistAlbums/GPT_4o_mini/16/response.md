### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that retrieves an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an `items` array, which holds the album data. Each album can have an `images` array, which contains objects representing the cover art for the album.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `return.images[]` is equal to 3, meaning that every response from this endpoint should contain exactly 3 images for each album.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The Swagger definition does not specify that the `images` array must contain exactly 3 items. It only states that it can contain an array of objects, and it allows for the possibility of having fewer or more images, or even none at all (as indicated by the description that states "If unknown: null or not returned").
2. **Counterexamples**: Although 500 calls did not yield any counterexamples, the fact that the invariant restricts the number of images to exactly 3 is a strong limitation that is not supported by the API specification. The presence of 10009 examples with 5087 distinct examples does not guarantee that the invariant holds universally, especially since the API could return albums with varying numbers of images.
3. **Semantic Consideration**: The invariant's assertion that `return.images[]` must always be of size 3 does not align with the flexibility typically found in APIs, where the number of items in an array can vary based on the data available.

### Conclusion
Given that the API specification does not enforce that the `images` array must contain exactly 3 items, and considering the possibility of albums having different numbers of images, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, as it contradicts the flexibility implied in the API's response structure.

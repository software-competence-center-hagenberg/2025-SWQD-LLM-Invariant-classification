Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                images:
                  type: array
                  description: The cover art for the album in various sizes, widest first.
                  items:
                    url:
                      type: string
                      description: The source URL of the image.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.url is Url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsUrl

The return fields refer to the path "items.images" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 554566 examples in the requests data, with 40699 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies an endpoint that retrieves an artist's albums, including a property `available_markets` which is an array of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes. The description indicates that an album is considered available in a market when at least one of its tracks is available in that market.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `available_markets` array must be greater than or equal to 1, i.e., `size(return.available_markets[]) >= 1`. This means that every response from this endpoint should have at least one market where the album is available.

### Analysis
- The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls and no counterexamples were found, which strongly suggests that the invariant holds true in practice.
- Additionally, there are 81,608 examples in the request data with 1,161 distinct examples, indicating a robust dataset supporting the invariant.
- The nature of the `available_markets` array implies that it should contain at least one entry if the album is available in any market. If an album has no available markets, it would be counterintuitive to return it as part of the response, as it would not be meaningful to the user.

### Conclusion
Given the strong empirical evidence from the tests and the logical reasoning based on the API's purpose, the invariant `size(return.available_markets[]) >= 1` is classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the lack of counterexamples and the nature of the data being returned by the API.

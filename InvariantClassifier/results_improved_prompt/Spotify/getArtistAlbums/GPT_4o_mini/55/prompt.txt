Invariant: LENGTH(return.id)==22

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString

Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
      - name: offset
        in: query
        description: The index of the first item to return
        type: integer
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            offset:
              type: integer
              description: The offset of the items returned (as set in the query or by default).


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.offset == return.offset

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two long scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 5454 examples in the requests data, with 20 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.offset=13; output.offset=13
input.offset=17; output.offset=17
input.offset=6; output.offset=6
input.offset=4; output.offset=4
input.offset=12; output.offset=12

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums, with the response containing two properties: `limit` and `total`. The `limit` indicates the maximum number of items that can be returned in the response, while `total` indicates the total number of items available.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.limit != return.total`, meaning that the limit of items returned should never equal the total number of items available.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `limit` is a parameter that can be set by the user (either through a query parameter or by default), while `total` is a property that reflects the total number of items available for that artist. 
2. **Possible Scenarios**: It is entirely possible for the `limit` to equal the `total` in cases where the total number of albums for an artist is less than or equal to the limit set by the user. For example, if an artist has 5 albums and the user sets the limit to 5, then `limit` would equal `total`.
3. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 100 calls and no counterexamples were found, which suggests that it may hold true in the tested scenarios. However, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that it will hold in all cases, especially since the API's behavior could vary with different artists or under different conditions.
4. **Specification Considerations**: The specification does not explicitly state that `limit` must always be less than `total`, and given the nature of pagination in APIs, it is reasonable to expect that there could be cases where `limit` equals `total`.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant `return.limit != return.total` is likely a false-positive. While it may hold true in the tested cases, the nature of the API allows for scenarios where the limit can equal the total. Therefore, it cannot be classified as a true-positive with certainty. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

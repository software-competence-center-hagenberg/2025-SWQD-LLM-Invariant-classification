### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums, which includes a response schema with two key properties: `available_markets` and `images`. 

- `available_markets`: An array of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes indicating where the album is available.
- `images`: An array of objects representing the cover art for the album, with properties for height, width, and URL.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `available_markets` array is not equal to the size of the `images` array minus one: 

`size(return.available_markets[]) != size(return.images[]) - 1`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests a specific relationship between the number of available markets and the number of images. It implies that for every album, the number of markets where the album is available should not equal the number of images minus one.

2. **Contextual Relevance**: There is no inherent logical relationship between the number of available markets and the number of images. An album can have multiple images regardless of how many markets it is available in. The invariant seems to impose a restriction that does not naturally arise from the data structure or the API's purpose.

3. **Testing Results**: The invariant has been tested across 100 calls without finding a counterexample, and there are 1074 examples in the request data, which suggests that it holds true in the tested cases. However, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that it will hold true universally, especially given the arbitrary nature of the relationship it asserts.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant imposes a specific relationship between two unrelated properties (available markets and images), and considering that the API documentation does not suggest such a relationship exists, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is moderate, at **0.75**, due to the lack of counterexamples but the inherent logical disconnect between the two properties.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will be an object containing an array of items, where each item has an `external_urls` property that is an object. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.external_urls != null`, meaning that for every album returned, the `external_urls` property should not be null. 

### Analysis
Given that the Swagger definition specifies that `external_urls` is an object, it implies that it should have a defined structure. While it is possible for the `external_urls` to be an empty object ({}), it cannot be null based on the schema provided. Since you have tested 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, this strongly suggests that the invariant holds true across all valid responses from the API. 

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the Swagger definition and the extensive testing conducted, the invariant `return.external_urls != null` is classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the lack of counterexamples and the clear definition in the API specification that supports the invariant.

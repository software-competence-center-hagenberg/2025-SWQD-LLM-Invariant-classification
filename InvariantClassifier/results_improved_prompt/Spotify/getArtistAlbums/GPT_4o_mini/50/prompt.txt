Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
      - name: include_groups
        in: query
        description: Filter by album types
        type: array
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            limit:
              type: integer
              description: The maximum number of items in the response (as set in the query or by default).


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.limit != size(input.include_groups[])-1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two long scalars. Prints as x != y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 77 examples in the requests data, with 41 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.include_groups=single%2Ccompilation%2Cappears_on; output.limit=20
input.include_groups=appears_on%2Csingle; output.limit=25
input.include_groups=appears_on%2Csingle; output.limit=20
input.include_groups=appears_on; output.limit=20
input.include_groups=album%2Csingle; output.limit=14

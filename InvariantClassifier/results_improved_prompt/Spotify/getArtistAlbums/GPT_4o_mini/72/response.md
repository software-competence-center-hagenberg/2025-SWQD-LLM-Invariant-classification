### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the API endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` returns a response containing an array of items, where each item has two properties: `id` (the Spotify ID for the album) and `uri` (the Spotify URI for the album). The `id` is a string that uniquely identifies the album, while the `uri` is a string that provides a uniform resource identifier for the album in the format `spotify:album:{id}`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.id` is a substring of `return.uri`. Given the examples provided, we can see that the `uri` is constructed using the `id` as follows: `spotify:album:{id}`. This means that the `id` is indeed a substring of the `uri` since the `uri` always contains the `id` at the end after the prefix `spotify:album:`.

### Analysis
- The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which strongly suggests that it holds true for the API's responses.
- The examples provided confirm that for each `id`, the corresponding `uri` contains that `id` as a substring, which aligns with the expected format of the `uri`.
- The specification does not contradict this invariant, as it clearly defines the structure of the `uri` and how it relates to the `id`.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant that `return.id` is a substring of `return.uri` is a true-positive. It holds for every valid request on the API, as evidenced by the extensive testing and the consistent format of the returned data.

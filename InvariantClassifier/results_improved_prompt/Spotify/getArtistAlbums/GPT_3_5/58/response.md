## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' returns a list of albums for a given artist.
- The response schema includes a field 'items' which contains an array of artists, each with 'id' and 'href' fields.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the 'id' of each artist in the response is a substring of the 'href' for that artist.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 251423 examples in the requests data, with 3583 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the 'id' of each artist is indeed a substring of the 'href' for that artist.
- The invariant type is 'daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString', which specifically represents the substring invariant between two String scalars.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, it is highly likely that the invariant 'return.id is a substring of return.href' is a true-positive for this REST API endpoint.

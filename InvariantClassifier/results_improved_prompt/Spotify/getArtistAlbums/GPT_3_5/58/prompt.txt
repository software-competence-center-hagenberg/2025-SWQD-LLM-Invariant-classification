Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            href:
              type: string
              description: A link to the Web API endpoint returning the full result of the request.
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                artists:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    id:
                      type: string
                      description: The Spotify ID for the artist.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.id is a substring of return.href

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString
Invariant description: Represents the substring invariant between two String scalars. Prints as x is a substring of y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items.artists" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 251423 examples in the requests data, with 3583 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.items.artists.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/1TA5sGRlKUJXBN4ZyJuDIX; return.items.artists.id=1TA5sGRlKUJXBN4ZyJuDIX
return.items.artists.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/1bpzpALZwOoKXzwMg2i8WB; return.items.artists.id=1bpzpALZwOoKXzwMg2i8WB
return.items.artists.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/76iBBRevLm9bGNAo9bBnIK; return.items.artists.id=76iBBRevLm9bGNAo9bBnIK
return.items.artists.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/5KZfRaQHfjizCZsoRV9vqA; return.items.artists.id=5KZfRaQHfjizCZsoRV9vqA
return.items.artists.href=https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/4AA474G2hRfrHyGrfyDseO; return.items.artists.id=4AA474G2hRfrHyGrfyDseO

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
      - name: offset
        in: query
        description: The index of the first item to return
        type: integer
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object

              items:

                    properties:
                      external_urls:

                      href:

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.offset >= size(return.artists[])-1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of >= between two long scalars. Prints as x >= y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 454 examples in the requests data, with 307 of them being distinct examples.

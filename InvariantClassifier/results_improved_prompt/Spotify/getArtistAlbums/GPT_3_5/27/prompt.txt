Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                total_tracks:
                  type: integer
              items:
                available_markets:
                  type: array
                  description: The markets in which the album is available: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes. Note that an album is considered available in a market when at least 1 of its tracks is available in that market.
                  items:
                    type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.total_tracks != size(return.available_markets[])-1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two long scalars. Prints as x != y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 320 examples in the requests data, with 138 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.items.total_tracks=39; return.items.available_markets=["AR","BO","BR","CL","CO","CR","EC","ES","GT","HN","MX","NI","PA","PE","PT","PY","SV","UY","VE"]
return.items.total_tracks=37; return.items.available_markets=["AR","BO","BR","CL","CO","CR","EC","ES","GT","HN","MX","NI","PA","PE","PT","PY","SV","UY","VE"]
return.items.total_tracks=31; return.items.available_markets=["AR","BO","BR","CL","CO","CR","EC","ES","GT","HN","MX","NI","PA","PE","PT","PY","SV","UY","VE"]
return.items.total_tracks=33; return.items.available_markets=["AR","BO","BR","CL","CO","CR","EC","ES","GT","HN","MX","NI","PA","PE","PT","PY","SV","UY","VE"]
return.items.total_tracks=30; return.items.available_markets=["AR","BO","BR","CL","CO","CR","EC","ES","GT","HN","MX","NI","PA","PE","PT","PY","SV","UY","VE"]

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' has a GET operation with a 'offset' query parameter.
- The response schema includes an array of 'images' with an 'height' field for each image.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'input.offset < return.items.images.height'. It states that the 'offset' parameter in the request should be less than the 'height' of the images returned in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, we have tried 10000 calls on the API and did not find a single counterexample. We found 13563 examples in the requests data, with 60 of them being distinct examples. The examples provided also show that the 'offset' values are consistently less than the 'height' values of the images in the response.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent examples found, the invariant 'input.offset < return.items.images.height' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

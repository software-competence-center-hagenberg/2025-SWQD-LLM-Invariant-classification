## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' has a GET operation that returns a list of albums for a given artist.
- The response schema includes a field 'available_markets', which is an array of strings representing ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes.

## Invariant
The invariant is that all the elements of 'return.items.available_markets[]' have a length of 2.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the nature of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes, it is reasonable to assume that these codes will always have a length of 2. The examples provided also support the invariant, and the large number of calls (10000) with no counterexamples adds to the confidence in the invariant.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a true-positive with high confidence.

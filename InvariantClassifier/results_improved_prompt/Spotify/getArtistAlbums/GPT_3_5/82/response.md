## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint is a GET request to "/artists/{id}/albums" with a query parameter 'market' that represents an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.
- The response contains a field 'previous' which is a string representing the URL to the previous page of items.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.market is a substring of return.previous

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 2741 examples in the requests data, with 2342 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the 'input.market' is indeed a substring of 'return.previous' in all cases.
- The 'market' parameter is a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, and it is reasonable to expect it to be a substring of the 'return.previous' URL.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the nature of the variables involved, it is highly likely that the invariant 'input.market is a substring of return.previous' is a true-positive.

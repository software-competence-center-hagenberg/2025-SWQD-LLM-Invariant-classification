## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' returns a response with a 'items' array, which contains an 'images' array. Each 'images' array contains 'height' and 'width' fields.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the height of the image is equal to the width of the image: return.height == return.width

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the nature of image dimensions, it is reasonable to expect that the height and width of an image would be equal for square images. The examples provided also support this expectation, as all three examples have the height equal to the width.

## Conclusion
Given the nature of image dimensions and the examples provided, it is likely that the invariant return.height == return.width holds true for the 'items.images' in the response body. Therefore, the invariant is classified as true-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' returns a list of albums for a given artist.
- The response contains an array of items, each with 'available_markets' and 'images' properties.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the size of 'available_markets' array minus 1 should not be equal to the size of the 'images' array.

## Analysis
Based on the Swagger definition and the nature of the response, it is unlikely that the size of 'available_markets' array minus 1 would have a specific relationship with the size of the 'images' array. The two arrays represent different aspects of the album data and are not inherently related in a way that would satisfy this invariant.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a false-positive. The relationship between the sizes of these arrays is not supported by the API specification, and it is unlikely to hold for every valid request.

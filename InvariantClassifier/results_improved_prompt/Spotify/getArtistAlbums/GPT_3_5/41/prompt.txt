Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            total:
              type: integer
              description: The total number of items available to return.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.total >= 0

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.LowerBound
Invariant description: Represents the invariant x >= c, where c is a constant and x is a long scalar.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 915 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.total=1078
return.total=1075
return.total=1079
return.total=260
return.total=262

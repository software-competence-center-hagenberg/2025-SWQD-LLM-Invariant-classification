## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' has a GET operation with a parameter 'include_groups' of type array in the query.
- The response schema includes a field 'available_markets' which is an array of strings.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(input.include_groups[]) <= size(return.available_markets[])
This means that the size of the 'include_groups' array in the request should be less than or equal to the size of the 'available_markets' array in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the 'include_groups' parameter can take multiple values, and the 'available_markets' array in the response can have varying sizes.
For all 100 calls made, the invariant holds true, and 89 distinct examples were found where the invariant holds.

## Conclusion
Given the large number of examples and the absence of any counterexamples, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The semantic relationship between the 'include_groups' parameter and the 'available_markets' array also aligns with the invariant, further supporting its correctness.

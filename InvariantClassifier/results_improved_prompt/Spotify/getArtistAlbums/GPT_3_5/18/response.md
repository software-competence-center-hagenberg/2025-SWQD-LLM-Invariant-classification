## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' has a 'get' operation with a 'limit' query parameter.
- The response schema includes an array of available markets for the albums.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.limit != size(return.available_markets[])-1

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the 'limit' parameter is not equal to the size of 'available_markets' array minus 1. This means that the 'limit' should not be one less than the number of available markets.

Given the examples provided, the invariant holds true for all 100 calls made to the API. The examples show that for each request, the 'limit' parameter is not equal to the size of 'available_markets' array minus 1.

The examples also demonstrate a variety of 'limit' values and corresponding 'available_markets' arrays, indicating that the invariant is consistently satisfied across different input values.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'input.limit != size(return.available_markets[])-1' is classified as a true-positive. The examples provided and the absence of counterexamples support the conclusion that the invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
      - name: include_groups
        in: query
        description: Filter by album types
        type: array
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                images:
                  type: array
                  description: The cover art for the album in various sizes, widest first.

                    properties:
                      height:
                        description: The image height in pixels. If unknown: null or not returned.
                      url:
                        description: The source URL of the image.
                      width:

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: size(input.include_groups[])-1 <= size(return.images[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntLessEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of <= between two long scalars. Prints as x <= y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 1000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11528 examples in the requests data, with 6614 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:
input.include_groups=compilation%2Cappears_on; return.items.images=[{"width":300,"url":"https:\/\/i.scdn.co\/image\/40450f23a34e81861938ca19e7738085b0337070","height":300}]

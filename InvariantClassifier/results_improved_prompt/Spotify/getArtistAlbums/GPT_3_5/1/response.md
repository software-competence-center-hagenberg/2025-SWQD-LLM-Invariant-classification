## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' returns a list of albums for a given artist.
- The response schema includes a field 'items' which contains an array of 'artists', each with a 'type' field.

## Invariant
The invariant is "return.type == 'artist'" which checks if the 'type' field of each artist in the response is equal to 'artist'.

## Analysis
- The invariant checks a specific field 'type' within the 'artists' array in the response.
- The specification does not explicitly mention other possible values for the 'type' field.
- The invariant has been tested with 10000 calls, and all examples found in the requests data support the invariant.
- The example value provided also matches the expected value for the 'type' field.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant "return.type == 'artist'" is classified as a true-positive. The high number of examples and the absence of counterexamples provide strong evidence for the correctness of the invariant.

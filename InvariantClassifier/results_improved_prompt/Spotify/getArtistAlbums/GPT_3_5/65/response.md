## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' returns a response with a 'href' field of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant is LENGTH(return.href)==56, which indicates that the length of the 'href' field in the response body is always 56 characters.

## Analysis
We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example. Additionally, we found 184868 examples in the requests data, with 13567 of them being distinct examples, all of which had a 'href' field with a length of 56 characters. The example values provided also confirm this.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the large number of examples, it is highly likely that the invariant LENGTH(return.href)==56 is a true-positive for this REST API endpoint.

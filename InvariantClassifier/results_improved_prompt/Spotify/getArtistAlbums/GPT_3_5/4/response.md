## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' has a GET operation with a 'limit' query parameter.
- The response schema includes an array of 'images' with each item having a 'height' field.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.limit < return.height
This means that the 'limit' specified in the request should be less than the 'height' of the images returned in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the nature of the API, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The examples show that for different values of 'limit' in the request, the 'height' of the images in the response consistently satisfies the invariant. Additionally, the nature of the 'limit' parameter and the 'height' field in the response suggests that the invariant is a valid condition for this API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.95

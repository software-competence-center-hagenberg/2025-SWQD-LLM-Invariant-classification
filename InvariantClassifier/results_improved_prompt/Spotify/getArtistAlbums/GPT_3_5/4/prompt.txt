Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
      - name: limit
        in: query
        description: The maximum number of items to return
        type: integer
        minimum: 0
        maxLength: 50
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                images:
                  type: array
                  description: The cover art for the album in various sizes, widest first.
                  items:
                    height:
                      type: integer
                      description: The image height in pixels. If unknown: null or not returned.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.limit < return.height

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntLessThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of < between two long scalars. Prints as x < y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items.images" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 15726 examples in the requests data, with 150 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.limit=35; return.items.images.height=64
input.limit=14; return.items.images.height=64
input.limit=49; return.items.images.height=300
input.limit=3; return.items.images.height=300
input.limit=6; return.items.images.height=64

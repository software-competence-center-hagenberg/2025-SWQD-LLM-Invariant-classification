## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' has a GET method with a 'limit' query parameter.
- The response schema includes an array of 'images' for each album, with each 'image' object containing 'height', 'url', and 'width' properties.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.limit >= size(return.images[])-1
This means that the value of the 'limit' parameter in the request should be greater than or equal to the number of images returned for each album minus 1.

## Analysis
Based on the Swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to expect that the number of images returned for an album should be related to the 'limit' parameter. If the 'limit' parameter is set to a certain value, the API should return at least that many images for each album. The invariant aligns with this expectation.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes a field 'items' which contains an array of objects, each with a field 'images' that contains an array of objects representing cover art for the album.
- Each cover art object has fields 'height', 'url', and 'width'.

## Invariant
The invariant is size(return.images[]) == 3, which means that the number of images for each album should be 3.

## Analysis
Based on the response schema, the 'images' field is an array of cover art objects, and the invariant checks if the size of this array is always 3. Since we have tried 500 calls on the API and did not find a single counterexample, and we have found 10009 examples in the requests data with 5087 distinct examples, it is highly likely that the invariant holds true for this API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.95

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes a field 'items' which is an array of objects, each with a 'type' field of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant is LENGTH(return.type)==5, which means that the length of the 'type' field in the 'items' array is always 5.

## Analysis
Given the example value 'return.items.type=album', it is clear that the length of the string 'album' is not 5, so the invariant is a false-positive.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive
Confidence: 1

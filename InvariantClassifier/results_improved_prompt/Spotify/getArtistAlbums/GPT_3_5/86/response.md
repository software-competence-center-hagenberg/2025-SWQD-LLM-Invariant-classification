## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums, with a 'limit' parameter to specify the maximum number of items in the response.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.limit >= 1', which specifies that the 'limit' parameter in the response must be greater than or equal to 1.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, all 10000 calls returned a 'limit' value that is greater than or equal to 1. This suggests that the invariant holds true for all valid requests on the API. Additionally, the specification does not explicitly mention any other possible values for the 'limit' parameter, further supporting the likelihood of the invariant being true.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.limit >= 1' is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

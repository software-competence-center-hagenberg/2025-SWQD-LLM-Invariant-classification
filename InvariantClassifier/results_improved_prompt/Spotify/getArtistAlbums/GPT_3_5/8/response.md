## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint is a GET request to "/artists/{id}/albums"
- The response schema includes a field "items" which contains an array of objects
- Each object in the array has a field "external_urls" of type object

## Invariant
- The invariant is that "return.external_urls != null"

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, it is highly likely that the field "external_urls" will not be null in the response. This is because the Swagger definition specifies that the field "external_urls" is of type object, and objects in most programming languages cannot be null. Additionally, the API has been tested with 10000 calls without finding a counter example, further supporting the likelihood of the invariant holding true.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant "return.external_urls != null" is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

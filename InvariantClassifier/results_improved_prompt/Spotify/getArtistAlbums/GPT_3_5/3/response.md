## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' returns a list of albums for a given artist.
- The response contains an array of items, each of which has an 'images' field that contains an array of cover art for the album, with each cover art object having a 'height' field.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the 'height' of the cover art images in the response is one of {64, 300, 640}.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the nature of cover art images, it is reasonable to expect that the heights of the cover art images would be limited to specific values such as 64, 300, and 640. The examples provided also align with this expectation.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a true-positive. The confidence level is high given the large number of examples and the nature of cover art images having specific heights.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the provided examples and the nature of the 'limit' parameter and 'total' field, it is likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The examples cover a significant portion of the possible input values, and the invariant holds true for all of them. Therefore, the verdict is true-positive with a high confidence.

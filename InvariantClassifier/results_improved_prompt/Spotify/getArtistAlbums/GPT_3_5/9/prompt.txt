Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                images:
                  type: array
                  description: The cover art for the album in various sizes, widest first.
                  items:
                    type: object
                    properties:
                      height:
                        description: The image height in pixels. If unknown: null or not returned.
                      url:
                        description: The source URL of the image.
                      width:
                        description: The image width in pixels. If unknown: null or not returned.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.images != null

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.NonZero
Invariant description: Represents long scalars that are non-zero. Prints as x != 0, or as x != null for pointer types.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

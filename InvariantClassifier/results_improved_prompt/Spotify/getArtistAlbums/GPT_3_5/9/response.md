## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' returns a list of albums for a specific artist.
- The response body contains an array of items, each of which has an 'images' field.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.images != null', which checks if the 'images' field in the response is not null.

## Analysis
Based on the Swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to expect that each item in the response array should have an 'images' field that is not null. This is consistent with the structure of the response as described in the Swagger definition.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

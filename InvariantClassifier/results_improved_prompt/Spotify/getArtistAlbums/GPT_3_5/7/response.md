## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provided describes a REST endpoint for getting an artist's albums. The response schema includes a field 'album_type' which is a string representing the type of the album, with possible values 'album', 'single', or 'compilation'.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the 'album_type' in the response should be one of { 'album', 'compilation', 'single' }.

## Analysis
Based on the provided information, the invariant seems to be a true-positive. The response field 'album_type' is explicitly defined to have only three possible values, and the examples provided in the request data also confirm this. The invariant aligns with the specification and the examples found in the request data.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' returns a list of albums for a given artist.
- The response schema includes an array of 'artists' with 'type' and 'uri' fields.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the 'type' field is a substring of the 'uri' field for each artist in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the nature of the Spotify URI, it is likely that the 'type' field is a substring of the 'uri' field. The Spotify URI seems to contain the type of the artist as a prefix, making it highly probable that the 'type' is a substring of the 'uri'.

## Conclusion
Given the nature of the Spotify URI and the large number of examples, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive.

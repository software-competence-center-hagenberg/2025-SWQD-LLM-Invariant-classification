## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint returns a list of albums for a given artist, with each album containing an ID and a link to the Web API endpoint.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the ID of each album is a substring of the corresponding href link.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 184868 examples in the requests data, with 13567 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided also demonstrate that the ID is indeed a substring of the href for each album.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The relationship between the ID and href for each album seems to hold consistently, and the large number of examples provides strong evidence for the correctness of the invariant.

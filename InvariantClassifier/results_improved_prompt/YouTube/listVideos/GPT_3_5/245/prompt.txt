    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.recordingDetails.recordingDate is Timestamp. Format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmZ (Miliseconds are optional)

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.dates.IsTimestampYYYYMMHHThhmmssmm
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable is always a timestamp. Represented as x is Timestamp. Format
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 398 examples in the requests data, with 23 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.items.recordingDetails.recordingDate=2019-03-14T00:00:00Z
return.items.recordingDetails.recordingDate=2022-10-05T00:00:00Z
return.items.recordingDetails.recordingDate=2022-09-19T00:00:00Z
return.items.recordingDetails.recordingDate=2022-08-30T00:00:00Z
return.items.recordingDetails.recordingDate=2022-10-03T00:00:00Z

## Analysis
- 10000 calls were made on the API, and no counterexamples were found, indicating that the invariant holds for all these calls.
- 398 examples were found in the requests data, with 23 distinct examples, demonstrating that the invariant is satisfied by a variety of values.
- The example values provided are consistent with the specified timestamp format.

## Conclusion

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                snippet:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video, including title, description, uploader, thumbnails and category.
                  properties:
                    thumbnails:
                      type: object
                      description: Internal representation of thumbnails for a YouTube resource.
                      properties:
                        standard:
                          type: object
                          description: A thumbnail is an image representing a YouTube resource.
                          properties:
                            url:
                              type: string
                              description: The thumbnail image's URL.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.url is Url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsUrl
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable is always a URL. Represented as x is Url.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 20849 examples in the requests data, with 2565 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:

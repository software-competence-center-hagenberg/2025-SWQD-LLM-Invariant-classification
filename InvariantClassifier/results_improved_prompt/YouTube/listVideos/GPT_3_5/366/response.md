## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation with a parameter 'maxWidth' in the query.
- The response schema includes a 'pageInfo' object with a 'totalResults' field of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxWidth != return.pageInfo.totalResults

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and found 5040 examples in the requests data, with 4023 of them being distinct examples.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples we found, indicating that for every valid request, the 'maxWidth' in the input is not equal to the 'totalResults' in the response.
- The semantics of the variables 'maxWidth' and 'totalResults' make sense in the context of the invariant, as they represent different aspects of the request and response.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any relationship between 'maxWidth' and 'totalResults', and there are no constraints on their values that would contradict the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, as well as the semantic coherence and lack of contradictory constraints in the specification, the invariant 'input.maxWidth != return.pageInfo.totalResults' is classified as a true-positive.

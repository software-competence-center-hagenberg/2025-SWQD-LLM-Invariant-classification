## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provided describes a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response schema includes a field 'dimension' under 'contentDetails' which indicates whether the video is available in 3D or in 2D.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the length of the 'dimension' field in the response contentDetails is always 2.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the 'dimension' field takes on values '3d' and '2d', both of which have a length of 2. The examples provided align with the invariant, and the large number of calls (10000) with no counterexamples increases the confidence in the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant LENGTH(return.contentDetails.dimension)==2 is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

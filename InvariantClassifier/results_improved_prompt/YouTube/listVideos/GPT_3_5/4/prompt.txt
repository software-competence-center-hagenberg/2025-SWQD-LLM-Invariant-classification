This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                snippet:

                  properties:
                    localized:
                      type: object
                      description: Localized versions of certain video properties (e.g. title).
                      properties:
                        description:
                          type: string
                          description: Localized version of the video's description.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.snippet.description == return.snippet.localized.description

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StringEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two String scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 500 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 2105 examples in the requests data, with 630 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.items.snippet.description=THIS IS AMAZING ðŸ’ªðŸ‘?
(via @chaseunfiltered); return.items.snippet.localized.description=THIS IS AMAZING ðŸ’ªðŸ‘?
(via @chaseunfiltered)
return.items.snippet.description=toei animators were eatin good that day; return.items.snippet.localized.description=toei animators were eatin good that day
return.items.snippet.description=Thank you for watching. Subscribe for more.; return.items.snippet.localized.description=Thank you for watching. Subscribe for more.
return.items.snippet.description=; return.items.snippet.localized.description=
return.items.snippet.description=Welcome to neilthegarageguy or Neil the garage guy channel.; return.items.snippet.localized.description=Welcome to neilthegarageguy or Neil the garage guy channel.

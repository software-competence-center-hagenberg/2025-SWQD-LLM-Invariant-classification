## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- It takes a query parameter 'id' which is an array of video ids.
- The response schema includes a 'thumbnails' object under 'snippet' which contains a 'high' object with a 'height' property.

## Invariant
- The invariant is: return.snippet.thumbnails.high.height > size(input.id[])
- This means that the height of the high thumbnail should be greater than the size of the array of video ids.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 562 examples in the requests data, with 343 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the height of the high thumbnail is consistently 360, while the size of the input id array varies.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples tested.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the height of the high thumbnail.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent behavior of the API, the invariant 'return.snippet.thumbnails.high.height > size(input.id[])' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

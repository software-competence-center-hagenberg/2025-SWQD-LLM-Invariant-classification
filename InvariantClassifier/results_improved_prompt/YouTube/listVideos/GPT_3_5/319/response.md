## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation with a parameter named "maxHeight" of type integer and a response body containing a field "regionRestriction" with a property "allowed" of type array.

## Invariant
- The invariant is: input.maxHeight > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[])
- This means that the value of "maxHeight" in the request should be greater than the size of the array "allowed" in the response.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- There are 301 distinct examples of the invariant holding, with a total of 351 examples in the requests data.
- The examples provided show that the value of "maxHeight" in the request is consistently greater than the size of the array "allowed" in the response.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the values of "maxHeight" or the size of the array "allowed" that would contradict the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the large number of examples, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a 'snippet' and 'topicDetails' object.
- The 'snippet' object contains a 'thumbnails' object, which in turn contains a 'high' object with a 'width' property.
- The 'topicDetails' object contains a 'topicCategories' array of strings.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a numeric divides invariant, represented as 'return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width % size(return.topicDetails.topicCategories[]) == 0'.
- It checks if the width of the high thumbnail is divisible by the number of topic categories.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 5717 examples in the requests data, with 163 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the width of the high thumbnail is consistently divisible by the number of topic categories.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples we have, indicating a strong likelihood of being a true-positive.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent validation of the invariant across multiple examples, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

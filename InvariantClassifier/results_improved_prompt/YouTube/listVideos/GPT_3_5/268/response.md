## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources.
- The response schema includes a property "items" which contains an array of objects.
- Each object in the array has a property "player" which is an object with properties "embedHeight" and "embedHtml" of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant is that the value of "return.player.embedHeight" is a substring of the value of "return.player.embedHtml".
- This is a daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString invariant, representing the substring relationship between two string scalars.

## Analysis
- The invariant has been tested with 10000 calls on the API, and no counterexamples have been found.
- There are 21277 examples in the requests data, with 17881 distinct examples.
- The nature of the data (string variables) and the large number of examples support the likelihood of this invariant being a true-positive.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the nature of the data, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources. The response body contains an array of items, each with a snippet and contentDetails object. The snippet object contains a thumbnails object, which in turn contains a default object with a height property. The contentDetails object contains a regionRestriction object, which has a blocked property that is an array of region codes.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])
This invariant checks if the height of the default thumbnail is greater than the number of region codes in the blocked array.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 4 distinct examples. The height of the default thumbnail is 90 in all cases, and the size of the blocked array is less than 90 in each example. Therefore, the invariant holds for the given examples.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant holds true for all the examples tested, and there are no counterexamples found in 100 calls. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

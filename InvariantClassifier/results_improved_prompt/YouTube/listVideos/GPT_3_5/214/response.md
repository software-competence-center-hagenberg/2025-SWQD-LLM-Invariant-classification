## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint is a GET request to "/youtube/v3/videos" with a query parameter "id" that is an array of strings.
- The response schema includes a field "nextPageToken" of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant is "return.nextPageToken in input.id[]" which means that the nextPageToken in the response is always a member of the input id array.

## Analysis
Based on the provided swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to assume that the nextPageToken in the response should be related to the input id array. However, the swagger definition does not explicitly state that the nextPageToken is related to the input id array. It is possible that the nextPageToken is related to the request in a different way or not related at all.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant "return.nextPageToken in input.id[]" is a false-positive. The swagger definition does not provide enough evidence to support this invariant, and it is possible that the nextPageToken is not directly related to the input id array. Therefore, the verdict is false-positive.

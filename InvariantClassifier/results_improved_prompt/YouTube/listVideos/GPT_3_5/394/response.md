## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation with a parameter 'maxHeight' in the query.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with 'items' containing 'snippet' containing 'thumbnails' containing 'default' containing 'width'.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxHeight != return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width
This invariant checks if the 'maxHeight' in the request is not equal to the 'width' in the response.

## Analysis
- The invariant has been tested with 10000 calls, and no counterexamples were found.
- There are 1237 examples in the requests data, with 1077 distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that 'maxHeight' and 'width' have different values in the response for various 'maxHeight' values in the request.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any relationship between 'maxHeight' and 'width', so the invariant does not contradict the specification.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the lack of counterexamples, along with the examples found and the lack of specification contradiction, the invariant is classified as a true-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies an endpoint that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes a field 'pageInfo' of type object, which contains the field 'totalResults' of type integer.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.pageInfo.totalResults >= 0', indicating that the total number of results in the response must be greater than or equal to 0.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 10000 examples in the requests data, with 164 of them being distinct examples.
- The example values of 'return.pageInfo.totalResults' are all greater than or equal to 0, as shown by the provided examples.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the range of 'totalResults', and it makes semantic sense for this value to be non-negative.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.pageInfo.totalResults >= 0' is a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is very high.

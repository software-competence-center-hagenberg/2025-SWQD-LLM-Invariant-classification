## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources, possibly filtered.
- The response body contains an array of items, each with a snippet and contentDetails object.
- The snippet object contains a thumbnails object, which in turn contains a high object with a height property.
- The contentDetails object contains a regionRestriction object, which has a blocked property that is an array of region codes.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a comparison between the height property of the high object in the thumbnails and the size of the blocked array in the regionRestriction object.
- The invariant states: return.snippet.thumbnails.high.height > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample for the invariant.
- There are 488 examples in the requests data, with 27 distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the height property of the high object is consistently greater than the size of the blocked array.
- The values of the variables in the examples support the invariant.
- The semantics of the variables also make sense in the context of the invariant, as the height is compared to the size of the blocked array.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent examples found, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

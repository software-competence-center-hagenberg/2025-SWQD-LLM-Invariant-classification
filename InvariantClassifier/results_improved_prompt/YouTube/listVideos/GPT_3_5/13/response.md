## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes a property "items" which is an array of objects, and each object may contain the property "ageGating".

## Invariant
- The invariant is a unary scalar invariant that checks if the field "ageGating" in the response is null.

## Analysis
- The invariant has been tested with 10000 calls on the API, and no counterexamples were found. This indicates a high level of confidence in the invariant.
- The response schema does not explicitly mention any other possible values for the field "ageGating", and the invariant aligns with the expectation that the field may be null.

## Conclusion

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a 'snippet' and 'contentDetails' object.
- The 'snippet' object contains a 'thumbnails' object, which in turn contains a 'default' object with a 'width' property.
- The 'contentDetails' object contains a 'regionRestriction' object, which in turn contains a 'blocked' array of region codes.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.items.snippet.thumbnails.default.width % size(return.items.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) == 0
This invariant checks if the width of the default thumbnail is divisible by the size of the blocked region codes array without a remainder.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 4 distinct examples. The width of the default thumbnail is 120, and the size of the blocked region codes array is 1, 6, 3, and 1 for the respective examples. In each case, the width is divisible by the size of the array without a remainder.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the examples and the structure of the response data, the invariant holds true for the given examples. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

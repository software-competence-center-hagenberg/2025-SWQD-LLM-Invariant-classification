## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of resources from the YouTube API.
- The 'maxResults' parameter is an optional query parameter of type integer with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum length of 50.
- The response schema includes a 'regionRestriction' object within the 'contentDetails' object, which contains a 'blocked' array of region codes.

## Invariant
The invariant is as follows:
- Invariant: input.maxResults != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])-1
- Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual
- Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two long scalars. Prints as x != y.
- Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
- Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
- The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

## Analysis
- The invariant checks if the value of 'maxResults' in the request is not equal to the size of the 'blocked' array in the response contentDetails.
- The provided examples show different values for 'maxResults' and the corresponding 'blocked' arrays in the response.
- The invariant holds true for all the provided examples, indicating that the size of the 'blocked' array is always one less than the value of 'maxResults'.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the relationship between 'maxResults' and the size of the 'blocked' array, and the examples support the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant appears to be a true-positive. The examples provided and the absence of counterexamples from 10000 calls on the API support the correctness of the invariant. Therefore, the verdict is true-positive.

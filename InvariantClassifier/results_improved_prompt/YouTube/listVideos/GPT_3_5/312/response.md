## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The Swagger definition provides a description of the REST endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`.
- The response schema includes a property `items` which contains a property `contentDetails`.
- Within `contentDetails`, there is a property `regionRestriction` which contains a property `blocked`.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a lower bound invariant that states `size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) >= 1`.
- This means that the size of the array `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked` must be greater than or equal to 1.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 1822 examples, with 40 distinct examples.
- The examples demonstrate that the `blocked` array always contains at least one region code.
- The Swagger definition does not explicitly mention any scenarios where the `blocked` array can be empty.
- The invariant aligns with the semantics of the `regionRestriction` property and the expected behavior of the API.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant `size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) >= 1` is classified as a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is high due to the large number of examples and the semantic alignment with the API specification.

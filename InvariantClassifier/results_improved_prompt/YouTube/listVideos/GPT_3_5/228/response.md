## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos with details about the content of each video.
- The 'definition' property of 'contentDetails' is a string with an enum of ['sd', 'hd'], indicating whether the video is available in standard definition or high definition.

## Invariant
The invariant is that LENGTH(return.contentDetails.definition)==2, indicating that the length of the 'definition' string is always 2.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the 'definition' property has the values 'hd' and 'sd', both of which have a length of 2. This aligns with the enum values specified in the swagger definition.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a true-positive. The examples from the API calls align with the specified enum values, and the invariant holds true for all the examples. Therefore, the invariant is correct and holds for every valid request on the API.

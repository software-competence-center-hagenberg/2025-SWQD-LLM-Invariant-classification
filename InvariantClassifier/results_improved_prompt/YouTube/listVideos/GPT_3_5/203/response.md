## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint is a GET request to "/youtube/v3/videos" which retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- It takes a query parameter "id" which is an array of video ids.
- The response contains a field "pageInfo" with a subfield "resultsPerPage" indicating the number of results included in the API response.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage == size(input.id[])
This means that the number of results per page in the response should be equal to the size of the array of video ids in the request.

## Analysis
- We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 28 examples in the requests data, with 19 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the number of results per page in the response matches the size of the array of video ids in the request.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any other values that the "resultsPerPage" field can take on, and the invariant makes semantic sense in the context of the API.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The invariant holds for all the examples tested, and there is no indication from the specification that it should not hold. Therefore, the verdict is true-positive.

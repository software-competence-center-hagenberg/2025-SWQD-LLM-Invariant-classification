## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a 'snippet' and 'contentDetails' object.
- The 'snippet' object contains a 'thumbnails' object, which in turn contains a 'default' object with a 'width' property.
- The 'contentDetails' object contains a 'regionRestriction' object, which in turn contains a 'blocked' array of region codes.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])
This invariant checks if the width of the default thumbnail is not equal to the size of the array of blocked region codes.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 27 distinct examples found in the 474 requests data. The examples show that the width of the default thumbnail is always different from the size of the array of blocked region codes.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.95

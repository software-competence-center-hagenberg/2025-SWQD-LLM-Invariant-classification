## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes a field 'pageInfo' with a subfield 'resultsPerPage' that represents the number of results included in the API response.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 0', which specifies that the number of results per page should be greater than or equal to 0.
- The invariant type is 'daikon.inv.unary.scalar.LowerBound', indicating that it represents the invariant x >= c, where c is a constant and x is a long scalar.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample for the invariant.
- We found 10000 examples in the requests data, with 51 of them being distinct examples, indicating a wide coverage of the API.
- The example values of 'return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage' include 2, 3, 0, 1, and 22, all of which satisfy the invariant.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the minimum value of 'resultsPerPage', and the values found in the examples are consistent with the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, as well as the consistency of the example values with the invariant, the invariant 'return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 0' is classified as a true-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a 'get' operation with a 'maxResults' query parameter of type integer and a minimum value of 1.
- The response schema includes a 'thumbnails' object under 'snippet', which contains a 'maxres' object with a 'width' property of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxResults < return.items.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.width

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 821 examples, with 50 distinct values for 'input.maxResults'. The examples demonstrate that the 'maxResults' value is consistently less than the 'width' of 'maxres' in the response.

The 'maxResults' parameter specifies the maximum number of items to be returned, and the 'width' of 'maxres' represents the width of a thumbnail image. It makes sense that the maximum number of items requested would be less than the width of a thumbnail image.

The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the relationship between 'maxResults' and 'width', and the examples cover a wide range of values for 'maxResults', increasing confidence in the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'input.maxResults < return.items.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.width' is classified as a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is high due to the large number of examples and the semantic coherence of the variables involved.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides a clear description of the REST endpoint and its parameters.
- The 'maxResults' parameter is defined as an integer with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum length of 50.
- The response schema includes a 'thumbnails' object with a 'high' object containing a 'width' property.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxResults < return.items.snippet.thumbnails.high.width
This invariant checks if the 'maxResults' parameter is less than the width of the high thumbnail in the response.

## Analysis
- The invariant is based on the comparison between the 'maxResults' parameter and the width of the high thumbnail in the response.
- The 'maxResults' parameter is an integer, and the 'width' property is also an integer.
- The invariant holds true for the provided examples, indicating that the 'maxResults' is consistently less than the width of the high thumbnail in the response.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the relationship between 'maxResults' and the width of the high thumbnail.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing with 10000 calls, the invariant 'input.maxResults < return.items.snippet.thumbnails.high.width' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation with a parameter named "maxWidth" of type integer.
- The response schema includes a field "items" which contains a field "snippet" with a field "tags" of type array of strings.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxWidth > size(return.items.snippet.tags[])

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 8981 examples in the requests data, with 7346 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show different values for input.maxWidth and return.items.snippet.tags, and in each case, the invariant holds true.
- The invariant compares the integer value of input.maxWidth with the size of the array return.items.snippet.tags, which is a valid comparison.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples provided, the invariant "input.maxWidth > size(return.items.snippet.tags[])" is likely a true-positive for the given REST API endpoint.

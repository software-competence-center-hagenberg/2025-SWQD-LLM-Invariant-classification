Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                liveStreamingDetails:
                  type: object
                  description: Details about the live streaming metadata.
                  properties:
                    concurrentViewers:
                      type: string
                      description: The number of viewers currently watching the broadcast. The property and its value will be present if the broadcast has current viewers and the broadcast owner has not hidden the viewcount for the video. Note that YouTube stops tracking the number of concurrent viewers for a broadcast when the broadcast ends. So, this property would not identify the number of viewers watching an archived video of a live broadcast that already ended.
              items:
                snippet:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video, including title, description, uploader, thumbnails and category.
                  properties:
                    categoryId:
                      type: string
                      description: The YouTube video category associated with the video.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.snippet.categoryId is a substring of return.liveStreamingDetails.concurrentViewers

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString
Invariant description: Represents the substring invariant between two String scalars. Prints as x is a substring of y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 1000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 2 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:
return.items.liveStreamingDetails.concurrentViewers=310; return.items.snippet.categoryId=10

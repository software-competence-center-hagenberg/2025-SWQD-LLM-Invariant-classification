## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes a property 'items' which contains an array of items, each with a 'liveStreamingDetails' object.
- The 'liveStreamingDetails' object has a property 'scheduledEndTime' of type string, representing the time that the broadcast is scheduled to end.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime == "2022-10-04T18:00:00Z"

## Analysis
The invariant is checking if the 'scheduledEndTime' in the response is always equal to the specific value "2022-10-04T18:00:00Z". The provided example value of 'scheduledEndTime' matches the expected value in the invariant.

Given that 1000 calls have been made to the API and no counterexamples have been found, and there are 2 distinct examples in the requests data, the invariant seems to hold true for the tested cases.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

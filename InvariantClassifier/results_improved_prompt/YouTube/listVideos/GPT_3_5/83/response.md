## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation with a parameter named "maxResults" of type integer and a minimum value of 1.
- The response body contains a nested structure with the field "regionRestriction" which has a field named "blocked" of type array of strings.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxResults > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])
This means that the value of the "maxResults" parameter in the request should be greater than the number of elements in the "blocked" array in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all the tested cases. The examples show that the value of "maxResults" is consistently greater than the size of the "blocked" array in the response.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

The invariant holds true for all tested cases, and the examples provide strong evidence that the invariant is correct. The examples cover a range of values for "maxResults" and different sizes of the "blocked" array, supporting the validity of the invariant. However, the confidence is not 1.0 due to the limited number of distinct examples and the possibility of untested edge cases.

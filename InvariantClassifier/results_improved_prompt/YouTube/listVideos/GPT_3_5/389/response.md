## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a 'snippet' and 'contentDetails' object.
- The 'snippet' object contains a 'thumbnails' object, which in turn contains a 'standard' object with a 'width' property.
- The 'contentDetails' object contains a 'regionRestriction' object with an 'allowed' array of region codes.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a comparison between the 'width' property of 'return.items.snippet.thumbnails.standard' and the size of the 'return.items.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed' array.
- The invariant states that the 'width' should be greater than the size of the 'allowed' array.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- We found 72 examples in the requests data, with 17 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the 'width' property is consistently greater than the size of the 'allowed' array.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the relationship between these two properties.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent examples found, the invariant 'return.items.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width > size(return.items.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[])' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

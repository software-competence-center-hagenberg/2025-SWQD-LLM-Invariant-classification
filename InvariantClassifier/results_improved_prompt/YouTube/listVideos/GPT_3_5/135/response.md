## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing 'contentDetails' and 'status' objects.
- The 'contentDetails' object contains a 'regionRestriction' object, which in turn contains a 'blocked' array of region codes.
- The 'status' object contains a 'privacyStatus' field with an enum of ['public', 'unlisted', 'private'].

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.status.privacyStatus in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]
This invariant checks if the 'privacyStatus' of a video is in the 'blocked' array of region codes.

## Analysis
The invariant is checking if the 'privacyStatus' is in the 'blocked' array, which seems to be a valid check for whether a video is blocked in a specific region.
Given that 50 calls have been made to the API without finding a single counterexample, it is likely that the invariant holds true for this API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

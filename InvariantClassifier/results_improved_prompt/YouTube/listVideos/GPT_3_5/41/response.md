## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with properties for the video items, including the snippet and thumbnails.
- The thumbnails property contains a medium property, which in turn contains a width property.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the width of the medium thumbnail must be 320.

## Analysis
- The invariant is a unary scalar invariant, specifying that the width of the medium thumbnail must be 320.
- The example provided in the request data confirms that the invariant holds for at least one valid response.
- The specification does not explicitly mention other possible values for the width of the medium thumbnail.
- The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of the API, as it ensures that the medium thumbnail width is consistently 320.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing (10000 calls) with no counterexamples, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation with a parameter 'id' in the query.
- The response schema includes the field 'pageInfo.resultsPerPage' of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= size(input.id[])-1

## Analysis
The invariant compares the 'resultsPerPage' field in the response with the size of the 'id' array in the request. It checks if the number of results per page is greater than or equal to the size of the 'id' array minus 1.

Given the examples provided, the invariant holds true for all 366 examples, with 198 distinct examples. The examples cover a wide range of 'id' array sizes and corresponding 'resultsPerPage' values.

The invariant makes semantic sense in the context of the API, as it ensures that the number of results per page is at least as large as the number of ids requested minus 1.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the semantic coherence of the invariant with the API, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

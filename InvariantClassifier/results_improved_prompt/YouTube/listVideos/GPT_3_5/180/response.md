## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about the structure of the API response.
- The response contains an array of items, each with a snippet and contentDetails object.
- The snippet object contains a thumbnails object, which in turn contains a medium object with a width property.
- The contentDetails object contains a regionRestriction object, which has a blocked property that is an array of region codes.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.items.snippet.thumbnails.medium.width > size(return.items.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])
This invariant checks if the width of the medium thumbnail is greater than the size of the blocked region codes array.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all the tested cases.
- The examples show that the width of the medium thumbnail is consistently greater than the size of the blocked region codes array.
- The invariant makes semantic sense in the context of the API response structure.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the width of the medium thumbnail or the size of the blocked region codes array.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing (10000 calls) with no counterexamples, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

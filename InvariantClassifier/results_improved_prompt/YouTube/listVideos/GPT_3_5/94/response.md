## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET method that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The 'maxWidth' parameter is a query parameter of type integer with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192.
- The response schema includes a 'thumbnails' object within the 'snippet' object, which contains a 'standard' object with a 'width' property of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxWidth > return.items.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width
This invariant checks if the 'maxWidth' provided in the request is greater than the 'width' of the standard thumbnail in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 5 examples. The 'maxWidth' values are consistently greater than the 'width' of the standard thumbnail in the response.

## Conclusion
Given that the invariant holds for all 5 examples and no counterexamples were found in 100 calls, it is classified as a true-positive. The confidence is high due to the consistency of the examples and the number of calls made.

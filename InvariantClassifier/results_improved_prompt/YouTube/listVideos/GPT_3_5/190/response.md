## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about the structure of the response for the endpoint.
- It includes details about the properties of the response object, such as 'items', 'snippet', 'thumbnails', 'standard', 'width', and 'contentDetails', 'regionRestriction', 'blocked'.

## Invariant
The invariant is as follows:
return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])
This invariant checks if the width of the standard thumbnail is greater than the number of blocked regions.

## Analysis
- The invariant compares the width of the standard thumbnail with the number of blocked regions. This comparison seems to be semantically valid in the context of the YouTube API.
- The examples provided show that the width of the standard thumbnail is consistently greater than the number of blocked regions in the contentDetails.
- The large number of examples (371) and distinct examples (24) found in the requests data support the likelihood of this invariant being a true-positive.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints or conditions that would contradict this invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

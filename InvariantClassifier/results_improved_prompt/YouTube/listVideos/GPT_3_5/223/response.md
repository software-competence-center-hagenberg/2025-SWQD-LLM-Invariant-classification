## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The 'part' parameter is specified as an array of video resource properties that the API response will include.
- The 'pageInfo' object in the response contains the 'resultsPerPage' field, which indicates the number of results included in the API response.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage != size(input.part[])-1
This invariant checks if the number of results per page in the API response is not equal to the size of the 'part' parameter array minus 1.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the 'part' parameter takes on different values, and the 'resultsPerPage' field in the response also varies. The invariant holds true for all the provided examples, indicating that the number of results per page is consistently not equal to the size of the 'part' parameter array minus 1.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the provided examples and the nature of the 'part' parameter and 'resultsPerPage' field, it is likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The invariant holds for the tested examples, and the semantics of the variables support the invariant. Therefore, the verdict is true-positive with a high confidence.

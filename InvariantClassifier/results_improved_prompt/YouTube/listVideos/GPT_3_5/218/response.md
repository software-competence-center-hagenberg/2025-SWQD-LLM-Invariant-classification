## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a GET operation on the endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" with a parameter named "maxResults" of type integer and a minimum value of 1.
- The response schema includes a field "pageInfo" with a subfield "totalResults" of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxResults != return.pageInfo.totalResults

## Analysis
- We have tried 1000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample, indicating that the invariant holds for all the tested requests.
- We found 556 examples in the requests data, with 168 of them being distinct examples, providing a substantial amount of data to support the invariant.
- The examples provided also demonstrate different values for the variables, showing that the invariant holds across various input and return values.
- The invariant makes sense in the context of the API, as the maxResults parameter specifies the maximum number of items to be returned, and the totalResults field represents the total number of results in the result set. It is reasonable to expect that these values can be different.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant "input.maxResults != return.pageInfo.totalResults" is classified as a true-positive. The substantial amount of data, the absence of counterexamples, and the semantic context of the variables support this classification.

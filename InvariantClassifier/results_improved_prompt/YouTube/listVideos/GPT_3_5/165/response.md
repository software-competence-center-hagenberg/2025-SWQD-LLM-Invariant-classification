## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The 'part' parameter is specified as an array of video resource properties that the API response will include.
- The response schema includes a 'snippet' object, which contains a 'thumbnails' object, which in turn contains a 'maxres' object with a 'height' property.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a numeric divides invariant, represented as return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.height % size(input.part[]) == 0
- This means that the height of the maxres thumbnail must be divisible by the size of the 'part' parameter array without a remainder.

## Analysis
- We have tried 50 calls on this API and found 13 distinct examples, all of which satisfy the invariant.
- The examples show that for different values of 'part', the 'maxres.height' is consistently 720, which is divisible by the size of the 'part' array.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the 'maxres.height' based on the 'part' parameter.
- The examples provide strong evidence that the invariant holds for the given API.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the examples found, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

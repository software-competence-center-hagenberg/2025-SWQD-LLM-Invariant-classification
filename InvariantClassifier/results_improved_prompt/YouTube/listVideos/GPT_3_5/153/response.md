## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The operation takes a query parameter named "part" which specifies a comma-separated list of video resource properties to include in the API response.
- The response body contains a field "items" which contains a field "snippet" which in turn contains a field "thumbnails" which contains a field "high" which contains a field "height" representing the height of a thumbnail image.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a numeric divides invariant represented as return.snippet.thumbnails.high.height % size(input.part[]) == 0
- This means that the height of the thumbnail image must be divisible by the number of properties specified in the "part" parameter.

## Analysis
- We have tried 50 calls on this API and found 13 distinct examples of the invariant holding.
- The examples of the variables show that the height of the thumbnail image is consistently 360, and the "part" parameter contains different combinations of properties.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples, indicating that the height of the thumbnail image is indeed divisible by the number of properties specified in the "part" parameter.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the height of the thumbnail image or the properties that can be specified in the "part" parameter.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

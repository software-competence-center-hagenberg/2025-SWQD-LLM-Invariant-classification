## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The operation takes a query parameter named "part" which specifies a comma-separated list of video resource properties to include in the API response.
- The response schema includes a field "items" which contains a field "contentDetails" with a nested field "regionRestriction" containing a field "blocked" which is an array of region codes.

## Invariant
The invariant is as follows:
- Invariant: size(input.part[]) != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])
- Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual
- Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two long scalars. Prints as x != y.
- Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
- Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
- The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant states that the size of the input parameter "part" array should not be equal to the size of the array "blocked" within the "regionRestriction" field in the response. The examples provided show different values for the input parameter and the corresponding "blocked" array in the response. The sizes of these arrays are indeed different in all the examples, which supports the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant holds true for all the provided examples. The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the sizes of these arrays, and the examples cover a variety of input parameter values and corresponding response arrays. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

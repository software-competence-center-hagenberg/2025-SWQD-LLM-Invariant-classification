## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources. The response body contains an array of items, each with a snippet and contentDetails object. The snippet object contains a thumbnails object, which in turn contains a high object with a height property. The contentDetails object contains a regionRestriction object with a blocked property, which is an array of region codes.

## Invariant
The invariant is a numeric divides invariant that checks if the height of the high thumbnail is divisible by the size of the blocked region array without a remainder.

## Analysis
The invariant is applied to the response body of the API, specifically to the fields return.items.snippet.thumbnails.high.height and return.items.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]. The invariant checks if the height of the high thumbnail is divisible by the size of the blocked region array without a remainder.

The provided examples of the variables show that the height of the high thumbnail is 360, and the blocked region arrays have varying sizes. In all 4 examples, the height of the high thumbnail is divisible by the size of the blocked region array without a remainder.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided examples and the nature of the variables involved, the invariant holds true for all the examples. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

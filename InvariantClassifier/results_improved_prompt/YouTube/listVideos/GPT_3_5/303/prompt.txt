Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                contentDetails:
                  type: object
                  description: Details about the content of a YouTube Video.
                  properties:
                    hasCustomThumbnail:
                      type: boolean
                      description: Indicates whether the video uploader has provided a custom thumbnail image for the video. This property is only visible to the video uploader.
                  properties:
                    licensedContent:
                      type: boolean
                      description: The value of is_license_content indicates whether the video is licensed content.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.contentDetails.hasCustomThumbnail == return.contentDetails.licensedContent

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two long scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 61 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:
return.items.contentDetails.hasCustomThumbnail=false; return.items.contentDetails.licensedContent=false

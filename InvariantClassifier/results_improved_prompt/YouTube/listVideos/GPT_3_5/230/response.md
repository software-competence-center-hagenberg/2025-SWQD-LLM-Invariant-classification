## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos.
- The response schema includes a field 'contentDetails' with a property 'projection' of type string and with an enum of values [rectangular, 360].

## Invariant
- The invariant is LENGTH(return.contentDetails.projection)==11, indicating that the length of the 'projection' string in the response should always be 11.

## Analysis
- The response schema does not specify a fixed length for the 'projection' string, and the enum values provided are 'rectangular' and '360', neither of which has a length of 11.
- The invariant does not align with the specification and the possible values for the 'projection' field.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive. The specification does not support the fixed length of 11 for the 'projection' field, and the enum values contradict this length requirement. Therefore, the invariant is not correct for this REST API.

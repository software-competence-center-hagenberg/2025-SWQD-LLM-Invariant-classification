## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The 'part' parameter is a query parameter of type array, and the response contains a 'snippet' object with a 'thumbnails' object, which in turn contains a 'standard' object with a 'width' property.

## Invariant
- Invariant: return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width > size(input.part[])
- Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
- Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
- Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
- Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
- The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

## Analysis
The invariant states that the width of the standard thumbnail in the response should be greater than the size of the 'part' parameter in the request.

- The 'part' parameter is a comma-separated list of video resource properties, and the 'size(input.part[])' represents the number of properties included in the 'part' parameter.
- The 'return.items.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width' represents the width of the standard thumbnail in the response.
- The invariant does not explicitly contradict the specification of the API.
- The examples provided show that the width of the standard thumbnail is always 640, which is greater than the size of the 'part' parameter in each example.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the examples provided, the invariant 'return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width > size(input.part[])' is classified as a true-positive. The invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

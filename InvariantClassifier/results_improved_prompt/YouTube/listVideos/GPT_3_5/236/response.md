## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provides information about the REST endpoint and the structure of the response.

## Invariant
The invariant is a fixed-length string invariant that specifies the length of the `actualEndTime` field in the `liveStreamingDetails` object.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the nature of the `actualEndTime` field, it is reasonable to assume that the length of the `actualEndTime` string will always be 20 characters. The examples provided are consistent with this assumption, and the large number of calls (10000) with no counterexamples increases the confidence in the invariant.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive

The invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence due to the large number of calls and the consistency of the examples with the specified fixed length of the `actualEndTime` string.

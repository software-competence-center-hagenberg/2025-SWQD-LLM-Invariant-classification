## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered, with a response schema containing 'items' that have 'contentDetails' and 'snippet' properties.
- The 'contentDetails' property contains 'regionRestriction' with a 'blocked' array, and the 'snippet' property contains 'tags' array.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the size of the 'blocked' array in 'contentDetails.regionRestriction' should not be equal to the size of the 'tags' array in 'snippet'.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 384 examples in the requests data, with 65 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show different values for the 'blocked' and 'tags' arrays, supporting the invariant.
- The invariant makes semantic sense as it compares the size of two arrays that represent different properties.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the semantic coherence of the invariant, it is classified as a true-positive.

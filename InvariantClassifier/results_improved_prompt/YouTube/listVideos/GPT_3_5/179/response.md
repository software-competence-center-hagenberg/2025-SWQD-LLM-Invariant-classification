## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The 'part' parameter is specified as an array of video resource properties that the API response will include.
- The response schema includes a 'thumbnails' object within the 'snippet' object, which contains a 'medium' object with a 'width' property.

## Invariant
- Invariant: return.items.snippet.thumbnails.medium.width > size(input.part[])
- Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
- Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
- Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
- Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
- The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

## Analysis
The invariant states that the width of the medium thumbnail in the response should be greater than the size of the 'part' parameter array in the request. The 'part' parameter specifies the properties to be included in the API response, and the 'width' property represents the width of the medium thumbnail.
Given the nature of the 'part' parameter and the response schema, it is reasonable to expect that the width of the medium thumbnail should be greater than the number of properties specified in the 'part' parameter. The examples provided also support this expectation.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing (10000 calls) with no counterexamples, it is classified as a true-positive invariant with high confidence.

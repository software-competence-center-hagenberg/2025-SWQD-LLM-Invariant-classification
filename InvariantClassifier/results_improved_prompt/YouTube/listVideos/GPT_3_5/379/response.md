## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about the REST endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`.
- The response schema includes a field `items` which contains a field `status` with properties `publicStatsViewable` and `selfDeclaredMadeForKids`.

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the `publicStatsViewable` field is equal to the `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` field within the `status` object in the response.

## Analysis
- We have tried 1000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example, indicating that the invariant holds for all the tested cases.
- We found 4 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples, which provides some evidence in favor of the invariant.
- The example values of the variables show that `publicStatsViewable` and `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` are both `true`, satisfying the invariant.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any other values that `publicStatsViewable` and `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` can take on, which supports the likelihood of the invariant being true.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant `return.status.publicStatsViewable == return.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids` is classified as a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is high due to the extensive testing and the lack of counterexamples.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of resources from the YouTube API.
- The endpoint accepts a query parameter 'maxHeight' of type integer, with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192.
- The response schema includes a 'pageInfo' object with a 'totalResults' field of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxHeight != return.pageInfo.totalResults

## Analysis
- The invariant compares the 'maxHeight' input parameter with the 'totalResults' field in the response.
- The 'maxHeight' parameter represents the maximum height of the resources to be retrieved, while 'totalResults' represents the total number of results in the result set.
- It is unlikely that the maximum height of the resources would be equal to the total number of results, as these are different properties.
- The 1000 calls made to the API did not find a single counterexample, and 895 examples in the requests data support the invariant.
- The examples provided show distinct values for 'maxHeight' and 'totalResults', further supporting the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing with 1000 calls, the invariant 'input.maxHeight != return.pageInfo.totalResults' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

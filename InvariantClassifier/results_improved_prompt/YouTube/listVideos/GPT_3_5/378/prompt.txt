Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                status:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video category, such as its localized title. Next Id: 17
                  properties:
                    madeForKids:
                      type: boolean
                  properties:
                    selfDeclaredMadeForKids:
                      type: boolean


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.status.madeForKids == return.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two long scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 46 examples in the requests data, with 2 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 2 example values of the variables:
return.items.status.madeForKids=false; return.items.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids=false
return.items.status.madeForKids=true; return.items.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids=true

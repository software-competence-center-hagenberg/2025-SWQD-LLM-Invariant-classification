## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint is a GET request to "/youtube/v3/videos" with a query parameter "maxHeight" of type integer.
- The response contains an array of video items.

## Invariant
- The invariant is that input.maxHeight is greater than the size of the return.items array.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- There are 5915 distinct examples of input.maxHeight and return.items from 6899 examples in the requests data.
- The examples show that for each request, the input.maxHeight is indeed greater than the size of the return.items array.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the relationship between input.maxHeight and the size of return.items.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The examples from the requests data also support the correctness of the invariant. Therefore, the verdict is true-positive with high confidence.

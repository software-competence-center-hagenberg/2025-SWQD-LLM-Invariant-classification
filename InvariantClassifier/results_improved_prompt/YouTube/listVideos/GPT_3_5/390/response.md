## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- It takes a query parameter 'id' which is an array of video ids.
- The response contains a list of items, each with a 'contentDetails' object containing 'regionRestriction' with a 'blocked' array of region codes.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(input.id[]) % size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) == 0
This means that the size of the input video ids array should be divisible by the size of the blocked region codes array without a remainder.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all the tested cases. The input video ids array size is always divisible by the size of the blocked region codes array without a remainder.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a true-positive. The invariant holds for all tested cases, and the examples provide strong evidence that it holds for a variety of input video ids and corresponding blocked region codes. Therefore, I am confident in classifying this invariant as a true-positive.

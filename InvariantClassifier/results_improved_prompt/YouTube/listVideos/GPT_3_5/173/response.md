## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The 'part' parameter is a required query parameter of type array, specifying a comma-separated list of one or more video resource properties that the API response will include.
- The response schema includes a 'snippet' object, which contains a 'thumbnails' object, which in turn contains a 'medium' object with a 'height' property.

## Invariant
- The invariant is: return.items.snippet.thumbnails.medium.height % size(input.part[]) == 0
- This invariant checks if the height of the medium thumbnail is divisible by the number of properties specified in the 'part' parameter.

## Analysis
- We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 13 distinct examples in the requests data, with 13 distinct values for the 'input.part' parameter and 'return.items.snippet.thumbnails.medium.height'.
- All 13 examples show that the height of the medium thumbnail is 180, and the 'part' parameter contains different combinations of properties.
- The invariant holds true for all 13 examples, indicating that the height of the medium thumbnail is divisible by the number of properties specified in the 'part' parameter.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the API calls and the examples, the invariant 'return.items.snippet.thumbnails.medium.height % size(input.part[]) == 0' is a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is high due to the large number of examples and the consistency of the results.

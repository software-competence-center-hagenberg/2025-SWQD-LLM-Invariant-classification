## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes a property 'items' which contains an array of objects with 'contentDetails' and 'liveStreamingDetails' properties.
- The 'contentDetails' object includes a 'regionRestriction' property with a 'blocked' array of region codes.
- The 'liveStreamingDetails' object includes an 'actualEndTime' property.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]
This invariant checks if the 'actualEndTime' in the 'liveStreamingDetails' is present in the 'blocked' array of region codes in the 'regionRestriction' of the 'contentDetails'.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, it is highly unlikely that the 'actualEndTime' in 'liveStreamingDetails' would be present in the 'blocked' array of region codes in 'regionRestriction'. These two properties are semantically unrelated, and there is no indication in the specification that they should be related in this way. Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive
Confidence: 0.9

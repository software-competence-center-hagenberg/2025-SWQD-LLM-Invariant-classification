## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a GET operation on the endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" with a "maxResults" query parameter of type integer and a minimum value of 1.
- The response schema includes a field "items" containing a field "contentDetails" with a field "regionRestriction" containing a field "blocked" of type array of strings.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxResults != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])
This means that the value of the "maxResults" parameter in the request should not be equal to the size of the "blocked" array in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 178 examples, with 102 distinct examples. The examples show different values of "maxResults" in the request and the corresponding sizes of the "blocked" array in the response. The invariant is consistent with the behavior observed in the API responses.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.95

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                liveStreamingDetails:
                  type: object
                  description: Details about the live streaming metadata.
                  properties:
                    scheduledEndTime:
                      type: string
                      description: The time that the broadcast is scheduled to end. If the value is empty or the property is not present, then the broadcast is scheduled to contiue indefinitely.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime)==20

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 47 examples in the requests data, with 7 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.items.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime=2022-10-08T16:25:00Z
return.items.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime=2022-10-07T18:55:00Z
return.items.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime=2022-10-05T18:00:00Z
return.items.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime=2022-10-04T18:30:00Z
return.items.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime=2019-03-14T18:00:00Z

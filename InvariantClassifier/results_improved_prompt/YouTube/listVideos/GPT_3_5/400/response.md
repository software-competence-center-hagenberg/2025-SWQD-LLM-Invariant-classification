## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of resources, possibly filtered. The response schema includes a property 'items' which contains 'liveStreamingDetails' with a property 'scheduledEndTime' of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant is LENGTH(return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime)==20, which means that the length of the 'scheduledEndTime' string in the response should always be 20 characters.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample. Additionally, we found 47 examples in the requests data, with 7 of them being distinct examples. The example values of the 'scheduledEndTime' variable all have a length of 20 characters.
- The examples provided are valid ISO 8601 date and time strings, which indeed have a length of 20 characters.

## Conclusion
- Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The examples align with the specification, and the invariant holds for all the tested cases.

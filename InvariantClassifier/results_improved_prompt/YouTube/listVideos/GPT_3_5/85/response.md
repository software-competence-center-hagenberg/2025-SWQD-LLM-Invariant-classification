## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation with a parameter 'maxWidth' in the query.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with 'items' containing 'snippet' containing 'thumbnails' containing 'default' containing 'height'.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxWidth > return.items.snippet.thumbnails.default.height

## Analysis
The invariant compares the 'maxWidth' parameter in the request with the 'height' field in the response. The invariant suggests that the 'maxWidth' should be greater than the 'height'.

Given the examples provided, the invariant holds true for all 5 examples. Additionally, out of 100 calls, no counterexamples were found. The examples cover a range of 'maxWidth' values and consistently show that 'maxWidth' is greater than 'height'.

The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the relationship between 'maxWidth' and 'height', and the examples provide strong evidence in favor of the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided examples and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant 'input.maxWidth > return.items.snippet.thumbnails.default.height' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

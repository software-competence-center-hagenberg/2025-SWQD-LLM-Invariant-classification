## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes a property 'items' which contains an array of 'fileDetails'. Each 'fileDetails' object contains a property 'videoStreams' which is an array of video stream objects.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.fileDetails.videoStreams == null

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the information about the API, the invariant 'return.fileDetails.videoStreams == null' is a false-positive. This is because the 'videoStreams' property is an array of video stream objects, and it cannot be null based on the schema definition. The 'videoStreams' property is expected to contain detailed metadata about a video stream, and it is represented as an array of objects. Therefore, the invariant 'return.fileDetails.videoStreams == null' does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive
Confidence: 1.0

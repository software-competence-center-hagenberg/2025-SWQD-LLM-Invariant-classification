## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing 'contentDetails' and 'player' objects.
- The 'contentDetails' object contains a 'regionRestriction' object with an 'allowed' array of region codes.
- The 'player' object contains an 'embedHeight' field of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.player.embedHeight in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]
This means that the 'embedHeight' value in the response player object should be a member of the 'allowed' array in the response contentDetails object.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to assume that the 'embedHeight' value in the 'player' object should be a valid region code that identifies countries where the video is viewable. This makes semantic sense and aligns with the structure of the response.

## Conclusion
Given that 100 calls have been made on this API without finding a single counter example, and considering the semantic alignment of the invariant with the response structure, I classify this invariant as a true-positive with high confidence.

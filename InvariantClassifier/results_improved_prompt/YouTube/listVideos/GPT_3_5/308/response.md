## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube video resources.
- The response schema includes a field 'contentDetails' which contains a field 'projection' of type string with an enum of ['rectangular', '360'].

## Invariant
The invariant is "return.contentDetails.projection one of { "360", "rectangular" }". This means that the 'projection' field in the response body should be either '360' or 'rectangular'.

## Analysis
Based on the provided information, the invariant is consistent with the response schema in the swagger definition. The enum constraint on the 'projection' field ensures that it can only take on the values '360' or 'rectangular'. The examples provided also match the expected values based on the enum constraint.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provided describes a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources, including details about videos and their region restrictions.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a numerical constraint that checks if the height of the default thumbnail is divisible by the size of the array of blocked region codes.
- Invariant: return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height % size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) == 0

## Analysis
- We have tried 100 calls on this API and found 4 distinct examples where the invariant holds true.
- The examples show that the height of the default thumbnail is 90, and the size of the array of blocked region codes varies from 1 to 6.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples, indicating that the height of the default thumbnail is indeed divisible by the size of the array of blocked region codes.
- The semantics of the variables also make sense in the context of the invariant, as the height of the thumbnail and the number of blocked region codes are both numerical values.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the examples found, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

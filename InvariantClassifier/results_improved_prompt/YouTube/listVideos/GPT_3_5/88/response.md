## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation with a parameter 'maxWidth' in the query.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with 'items', 'snippet', 'thumbnails', and 'high' containing a 'width' field.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxWidth > return.items.snippet.thumbnails.high.width
This invariant checks if the 'maxWidth' in the request is greater than the 'width' in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 5 examples. The values of 'maxWidth' in the requests are consistently greater than the 'width' in the responses.

## Conclusion
Given the 100 calls made on the API and the 5 examples provided, all of which satisfy the invariant, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is high.

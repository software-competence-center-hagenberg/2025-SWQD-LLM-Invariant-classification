## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources.
- The response schema includes a field "items" which contains a field "snippet" with a field "thumbnails" containing a field "medium" with a field "width".
- The response schema also includes a field "tags" which is an array of strings.

## Invariant

- The invariant states: return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.width > size(return.snippet.tags[])

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 20349 examples in the requests data, with 2362 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the width of the thumbnail is consistently 320, and the tags array contains various strings.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples provided.
- The comparison between the width of a thumbnail and the size of the tags array is semantically valid in the context of the API.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a true-positive. The invariant holds for every valid request on the API, and the provided examples support this conclusion.

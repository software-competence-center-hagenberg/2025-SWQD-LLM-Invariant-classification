## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with properties like "items", "contentDetails", and "player".
- The "embedWidth" property is a string within the "player" object, and the "allowed" property is an array of strings within the "regionRestriction" object.

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking if the value of "return.player.embedWidth" is a member of the array "return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]".
- This means that the embed width of the player should be one of the allowed region codes for the video to be viewable in that country.

## Analysis
- We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example for the invariant.
- The invariant makes semantic sense in the context of the API, as the embed width of the player could be restricted based on the region where the video is viewable.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any other values for the embed width or the allowed region codes, so the invariant is not contradicted by the specification.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is likely a true-positive. The semantic relevance and the absence of counterexamples from a significant number of calls support this classification.

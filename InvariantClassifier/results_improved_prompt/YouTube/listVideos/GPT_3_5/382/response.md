## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each with a 'status' object containing a 'selfDeclaredMadeForKids' boolean property.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids == true', which checks if the 'selfDeclaredMadeForKids' property in the response is true.
- The invariant type is 'OneOfScalar', representing long variables that take on only a few distinct values.

## Analysis
- We have tried 1000 calls on this API and found 4 examples in the requests data, with 1 distinct example where 'return.items.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids' is true.
- The invariant has been validated for 1000 calls and holds true for all examples found.
- The specification does not explicitly mention other possible values for 'selfDeclaredMadeForKids', and the invariant makes semantic sense in the context of the response.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, as well as the semantic coherence of the invariant with the response schema, the invariant 'return.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids == true' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

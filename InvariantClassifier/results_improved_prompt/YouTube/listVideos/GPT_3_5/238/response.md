## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about the REST endpoint and the structure of the response.
- The response contains a field 'actualStartTime' within 'liveStreamingDetails' which is a string representing the time that the broadcast actually started.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a fixed-length string invariant, indicating that the length of the 'actualStartTime' string is always 20 characters.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and found 3186 examples in the requests data, with 473 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided for the 'actualStartTime' field all have a length of 20 characters, which supports the invariant.
- The invariant does not contradict the specification and is consistent with the nature of the 'actualStartTime' field.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistency of the examples with the invariant, the invariant is classified as true-positive.

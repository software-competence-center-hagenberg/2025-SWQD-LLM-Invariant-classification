## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provided describes a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with properties like 'items', 'snippet', 'thumbnails', 'medium', 'height', and 'contentDetails', 'regionRestriction', 'blocked'.

## Invariant
The invariant is as follows:
- Invariant: return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.height % size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) == 0
- Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.NumericInt$Divides
- Invariant description: Represents the divides without remainder invariant between two long scalars. Prints as x % y == 0.

## Analysis
- The invariant checks if the height of the medium thumbnail is divisible by the size of the 'blocked' array in the region restriction of the video.
- The invariant is based on the assumption that the height of the medium thumbnail should be divisible by the number of blocked regions.
- The examples provided show that the height of the medium thumbnail is 180, and the number of blocked regions varies from 1 to 6.
- The invariant holds true for all the provided examples.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant holds true for the examples provided and aligns with the structure of the response schema. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

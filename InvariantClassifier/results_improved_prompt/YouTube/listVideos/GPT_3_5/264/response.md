## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing an ID and a snippet with thumbnails.
- The thumbnail object contains a high property, which in turn contains a URL.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the ID of a video is a substring of the URL of the high-quality thumbnail for that video.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 27720 examples in the requests data, with 3421 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the ID of the video is indeed a substring of the URL of the high-quality thumbnail for each video.
- The invariant type is daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString, which specifically represents the substring invariant between two String scalars.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The invariant holds for all valid requests on the API, and the confidence in this classification is very high.

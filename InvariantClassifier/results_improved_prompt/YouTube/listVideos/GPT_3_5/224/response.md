## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes a 'pageInfo' object with a 'resultsPerPage' field and an 'items' array of video resources.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= size(return.items[])', which states that the number of results per page should be greater than or equal to the number of items in the response.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- We found 11630 examples in the requests data, with 8234 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that for each response, the 'resultsPerPage' is indeed greater than or equal to the size of the 'items' array.
- The invariant makes semantic sense in the context of the API, as the number of results per page should logically be greater than or equal to the number of items returned.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the semantic coherence of the invariant with the API's purpose, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

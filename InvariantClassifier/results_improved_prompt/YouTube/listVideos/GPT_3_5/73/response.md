## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a 'get' operation with a 'maxResults' query parameter of type integer and a minimum value of 1.
- The response schema includes a 'thumbnails' object within the 'snippet' object, which contains a 'default' object with a 'height' property of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxResults < return.items.snippet.thumbnails.default.height

## Analysis
The invariant compares the 'maxResults' parameter in the request with the 'height' property in the response. The 'maxResults' parameter specifies the maximum number of items to be returned, and the 'height' property represents the height of a thumbnail image. Since the 'maxResults' parameter is an integer and the 'height' property is also an integer, the comparison is valid.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided data, the invariant holds true for all 842 examples found in the requests data, with 50 distinct examples. The comparison between 'maxResults' and 'height' is semantically valid and aligns with the purpose of the API endpoint. Therefore, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

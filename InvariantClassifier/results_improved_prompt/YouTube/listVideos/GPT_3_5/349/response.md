## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a 'snippet' and 'contentDetails' object.
- The 'snippet' object contains a 'thumbnails' object, which in turn contains a 'default' object with a 'width' property.
- The 'contentDetails' object contains a 'regionRestriction' object, which has a 'blocked' property that is an array of region codes.

## Invariant
- The invariant is: return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])-1
- This invariant checks if the width of the default thumbnail is not equal to the size of the blocked region codes array minus 1.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- We found 474 examples in the requests data, with 27 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the width of the default thumbnail is always the same, regardless of the size of the blocked region codes array.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples we have.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a true-positive. The examples and the extensive testing provide strong evidence that the invariant holds for this API.

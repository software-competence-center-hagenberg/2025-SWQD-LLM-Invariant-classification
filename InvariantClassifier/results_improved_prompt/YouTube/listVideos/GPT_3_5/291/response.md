## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources, possibly filtered.
- The response body contains an array of items, each with a snippet and contentDetails object.
- The snippet object contains a thumbnails object, which in turn contains a high object with a width property.
- The contentDetails object contains a regionRestriction object with a blocked property, which is an array of region codes.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width % size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) == 0

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the width of the high thumbnail is divisible by the size of the blocked region codes array without remainder. This means that the width should be a multiple of the number of blocked region codes.

Given the examples provided, we have 4 distinct examples where the width is 480 and the blocked region codes arrays have different sizes. In all cases, the invariant holds true, as 480 is divisible by the size of each array without remainder.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the response body in the swagger definition, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The invariant holds for all the examples tested, and it aligns with the structure of the response body. Therefore, the verdict is true-positive with high confidence.

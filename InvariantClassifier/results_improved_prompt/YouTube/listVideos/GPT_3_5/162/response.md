## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes a 'snippet' object with a 'thumbnails' object containing a 'high' object with a 'width' property, and a 'tags' array.

## Invariant
- Invariant: return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width > size(return.snippet.tags[])
- Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
- Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
- The return fields refer to the path 'items' in the response body.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 20349 examples in the requests data, with 2362 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the 'width' property of 'thumbnails.high' is consistently greater than the size of the 'tags' array in the response.
- The invariant is comparing the width of a thumbnail to the size of the tags array, which is a valid comparison based on the response schema.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent examples found, the invariant 'return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width > size(return.snippet.tags[])' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides a description of the '/youtube/v3/videos' endpoint, which returns a list of resources with a 'player' object containing 'embedHtml' and 'embedWidth' properties.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that 'return.player.embedWidth' is a substring of 'return.player.embedHtml'.

## Analysis
- Based on the swagger definition, 'embedHtml' and 'embedWidth' are both string properties within the 'player' object. The invariant checks if 'embedWidth' is a substring of 'embedHtml', which seems semantically reasonable for HTML embed code.
- The large number of examples (21277) and distinct examples (17881) in the requests data provide strong evidence in favor of the invariant being a true-positive.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: true-positive
- Confidence: 0.95

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The operation takes a query parameter 'id' which is an array of video ids.
- The response schema includes a 'thumbnails' object under 'snippet' which contains a 'medium' object with a 'width' property.

## Invariant
- The invariant is: return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.width > size(input.id[])
- This means that the width of the medium thumbnail in the response should be greater than the size of the array of video ids in the request.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 562 examples in the requests data, with 343 of them being distinct examples.
- The example values of the variables show that the width of the medium thumbnail is consistently 320, while the size of the input.id array varies.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples we have collected.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the width of the medium thumbnail or the size of the input.id array.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent examples, the invariant 'return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.width > size(input.id[])' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

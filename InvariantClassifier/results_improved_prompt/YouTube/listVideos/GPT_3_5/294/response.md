## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The operation takes a query parameter 'id' which is an array of video ids.
- The response schema includes a 'maxres' object under 'thumbnails' under 'snippet', which contains the 'width' of the thumbnail image.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.width > size(input.id[])'.
- This means that the width of the thumbnail in the response should be greater than the size of the array of video ids in the request.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 463 examples in the requests data, with 301 of them being distinct examples.
- The example values of the variables show that the width of the thumbnail is consistently 1280, which is greater than the size of the input id array in all cases.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples we have.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent examples, the invariant 'return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.width > size(input.id[])' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

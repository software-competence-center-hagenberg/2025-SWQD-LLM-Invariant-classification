## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The operation takes a query parameter 'id' which is an array of video ids.
- The response schema includes a 'thumbnails' object under 'snippet', which contains a 'default' object with a 'width' property.

## Invariant
- The invariant is: return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width > size(input.id[])
- This means that the width of the default thumbnail in the response should be greater than the size of the input array of video ids.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 562 examples in the requests data, with 343 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples of the variables show that the width of the default thumbnail is consistently 120, regardless of the size of the input array of video ids.
- The invariant does not align with the behavior observed in the API responses.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width > size(input.id[])' is a false-positive. The observed behavior in the API responses contradicts this invariant, and the confidence in this classification is high.

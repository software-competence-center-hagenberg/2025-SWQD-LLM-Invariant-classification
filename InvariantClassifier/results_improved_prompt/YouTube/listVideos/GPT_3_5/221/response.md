## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation with a parameter named "maxWidth" of type integer and a response schema that includes a field "pageInfo" with a subfield "totalResults" of type integer.

## Invariant
- The invariant is: input.maxWidth > return.pageInfo.totalResults
- This means that the maxWidth parameter in the request should be greater than the totalResults in the response.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 76 examples, with 48 distinct examples.
- The examples show that the maxWidth values are consistently greater than the totalResults values in the response.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints or relationships between maxWidth and totalResults, so there are no contradictions with the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

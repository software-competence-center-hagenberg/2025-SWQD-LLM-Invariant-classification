## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation with a parameter 'maxWidth' in the query.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with 'contentDetails' and 'regionRestriction' containing a 'blocked' array.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxWidth > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])

## Analysis
The invariant compares the 'maxWidth' parameter in the request with the size of the 'blocked' array in the response. The invariant holds true if the 'maxWidth' is greater than the size of the 'blocked' array.

- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- There are 665 examples in the requests data, with 563 distinct examples.
- The example values of the variables support the invariant, showing that for each example, the 'maxWidth' is indeed greater than the size of the 'blocked' array.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, the invariant 'input.maxWidth > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])' is classified as a true-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provided describes a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of resources, possibly filtered. The response schema includes a property called "items", which contains an array of objects. Each object in the array has a property called "fileDetails", which in turn has a property called "audioStreams".

## Invariant
The invariant provided is a unary scalar invariant of type OneOfScalar. It specifies that the field "audioStreams" within the "fileDetails" object should be null.

## Analysis
Based on the swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to expect that the absence of audio streams in the file details could result in the "audioStreams" field being null. Since 10000 calls have been made on this API without finding a single counter example, it is highly likely that the invariant holds true for this API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.95

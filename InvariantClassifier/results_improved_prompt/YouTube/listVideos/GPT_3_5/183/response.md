## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The operation takes a query parameter named "part", which is a comma-separated list of video resource properties to include in the API response.
- The response body contains a field "items" which has a field "snippet" containing a field "thumbnails" which in turn contains a field "standard" with a property "height".

## Invariant
- The invariant is: return.items.snippet.thumbnails.standard.height % size(input.part[]) == 0
- This invariant checks if the height of the standard thumbnail is divisible by the number of properties specified in the "part" parameter.

## Analysis
- We have tried 50 calls on this API and found 13 distinct examples of the invariant holding true.
- The examples of the variables show that the height of the standard thumbnail is consistently 480, and the "part" parameter values do not affect this height.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any relationship between the "part" parameter and the height of the standard thumbnail.
- The invariant seems to hold true for all the examples we have tested.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant "return.items.snippet.thumbnails.standard.height % size(input.part[]) == 0" is likely a true-positive. The consistent examples and the lack of specification contradicting the invariant support this conclusion.

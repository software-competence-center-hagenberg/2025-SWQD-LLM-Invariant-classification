## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos, with a specific schema for the response.
- The response contains an array of items, each with a contentDetails object that includes a projection field.
- The projection field is a string with an enum of values [rectangular, 360].

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the return contentDetails projection is equal to "rectangular".

## Analysis
- The invariant is checking a specific value of the projection field in the response.
- The Swagger definition specifies that the projection field can only have the values [rectangular, 360].
- The invariant aligns with the allowed values specified in the Swagger definition.
- The example provided also shows that the projection field can indeed have the value "rectangular".

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a true-positive as it aligns with the allowed values specified in the Swagger definition and is supported by the example provided. The confidence is high due to the large number of examples and the alignment with the API specification.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a 'get' operation with a 'maxResults' query parameter that specifies the maximum number of items to be returned.
- The response schema includes a 'snippet' object with a 'thumbnails' object, which in turn contains a 'standard' object with a 'height' property.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxResults < return.items.snippet.thumbnails.standard.height

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample to the invariant.
- There are 823 examples in the requests data, with 50 of them being distinct examples.
- The example values provided for the variables show that the 'maxResults' values are consistently less than the 'height' values in the response.
- The invariant makes semantic sense as it compares the maximum number of results requested with the height of the standard thumbnail.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the semantic coherence of the invariant, it is classified as a true-positive.

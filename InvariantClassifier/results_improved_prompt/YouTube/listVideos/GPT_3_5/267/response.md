- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing an ID and a snippet with thumbnails.
- The thumbnail object has a standard property containing a URL.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.id is a substring of return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.url

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- We found 20849 examples in the requests data, with 2565 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the ID in the return is indeed a substring of the URL in the return.
- The invariant makes sense in the context of the YouTube video ID being a part of the URL for the thumbnail image.

## Conclusion

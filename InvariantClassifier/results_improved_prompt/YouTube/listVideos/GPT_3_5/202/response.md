## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of resources from the YouTube API.
- The 'maxResults' parameter is a query parameter of type integer with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum length of 50.
- The response schema includes a 'pageInfo' object with a 'resultsPerPage' field of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the 'maxResults' parameter in the request should be equal to the 'resultsPerPage' field in the response.

## Analysis
- The invariant has been tested with 10000 calls on the API, and no counterexamples have been found.
- There are 3945 examples in the requests data, with 50 distinct examples, all of which satisfy the invariant.
- The examples provided show that for each 'maxResults' value in the request, the corresponding 'resultsPerPage' value in the response is the same.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any other values that 'resultsPerPage' can take on, and the invariant aligns with the intended behavior of the API.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the alignment with the API specification, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos with details about the content of each video.
- The response schema includes a property 'contentDetails' which contains the property 'regionRestriction' with the property 'allowed' that is an array of strings representing region codes.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the size of the array 'return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]' should be one of { 80, 94}.

## Analysis
- The invariant is checking the size of the array 'return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]' and expects it to be either 80 or 94.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the size of the 'allowed' array, so the invariant is not contradicted by the specification.
- The invariant is based on the assumption that the 'allowed' array should have a specific size, which is not explicitly stated in the specification.
- The invariant has been tested with 50 calls, and no counterexamples have been found.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is likely a true-positive as it is not contradicted by the specification, and there are no counterexamples found in the tested calls.

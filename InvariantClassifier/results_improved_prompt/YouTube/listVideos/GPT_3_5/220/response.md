## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation with a parameter "maxWidth" in the query.
- The response schema includes a field "pageInfo" with a subfield "resultsPerPage" of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxWidth > return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage

## Analysis
The invariant compares the request parameter "maxWidth" with the response field "resultsPerPage". The request parameter "maxWidth" is expected to be an integer representing the maximum height of the player, while the response field "resultsPerPage" is the number of results included in the API response. The comparison checks if the maximum width is greater than the number of results per page, which seems reasonable in the context of the API.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing with 10000 calls and 5116 examples, with 4000 distinct examples, and the semantic relevance of the comparison, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

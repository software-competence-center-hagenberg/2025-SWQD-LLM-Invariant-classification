Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
      - name: maxWidth
        in: query
        description: Return the player with maximum height specified in
        required: false
        type: integer
        minimum: 72
        maxLength: 8192
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            pageInfo:
              type: object
              description: Paging details for lists of resources, including total number of items available and number of resources returned in a single page.
              properties:
                resultsPerPage:
                  type: integer
                  description: The number of results included in the API response.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.maxWidth > return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 5116 examples in the requests data, with 4000 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.maxWidth=3688; return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage=2
input.maxWidth=693; return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage=29
input.maxWidth=6006; return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage=2
input.maxWidth=3729; return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage=4
input.maxWidth=1647; return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage=5

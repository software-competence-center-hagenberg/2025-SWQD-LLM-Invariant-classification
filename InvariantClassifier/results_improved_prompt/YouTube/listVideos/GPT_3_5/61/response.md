## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation with a parameter 'maxHeight' in the query.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with 'items' containing 'snippet' containing 'thumbnails' containing 'default' containing 'width'.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxHeight > return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width

## Analysis
The invariant compares the 'maxHeight' parameter in the request with the 'width' field in the response. The invariant suggests that the 'maxHeight' should be greater than the 'width'.

The examples provided show that the 'width' is always 120, and the 'maxHeight' varies. This indicates that the invariant holds true for the provided examples.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the API, the invariant seems to be a true-positive. The examples cover a significant portion of the possible combinations, and there are no counterexamples found in 1000 calls. Therefore, the verdict is true-positive with high confidence.

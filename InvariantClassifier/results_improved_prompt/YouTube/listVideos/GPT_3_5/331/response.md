## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The Swagger definition provides a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources, with a query parameter 'maxWidth' specified as an integer.
- The response schema includes a 'thumbnails' object within the 'snippet' object, which contains a 'standard' object with a 'width' property.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxWidth != return.items.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width
This invariant checks if the 'maxWidth' parameter in the request is not equal to the 'width' property in the response.

## Analysis
- The invariant has been tested with 10000 calls on the API, and no counterexamples were found.
- There are 1008 examples in the requests data, with 786 distinct examples, indicating a diverse set of test cases.
- The examples provided show that the 'maxWidth' in the request is consistently not equal to the 'width' in the response.
- The invariant aligns with the semantics of the API, as the 'maxWidth' parameter is expected to differ from the 'width' property in the response.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent alignment with the API semantics, the invariant is classified as a true-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The operation has a query parameter named "maxResults" of type integer with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum length of 50.
- The response schema includes a field "items" with a nested field "contentDetails" containing a field "regionRestriction" with a sub-field "allowed" of type array of strings.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxResults != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[])
This invariant checks if the value of the input parameter "maxResults" is not equal to the size of the array "allowed" in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, we have 71 examples in the requests data, with 46 of them being distinct examples. The examples show different values for the input parameter "maxResults" and the corresponding array of allowed regions in the response. None of the examples violate the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the examples and the absence of any counterexamples in the 1000 calls made to the API, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The invariant holds for all the observed examples, and the number of examples and distinct values increases the confidence in the correctness of the invariant.

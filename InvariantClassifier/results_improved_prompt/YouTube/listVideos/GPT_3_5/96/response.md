## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation with a query parameter 'maxWidth' of type integer.
- The response schema includes a field 'topicDetails' which contains a field 'topicCategories' of type array of strings.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxWidth > size(return.topicDetails.topicCategories[])
This means that the value of 'maxWidth' in the request should be greater than the number of elements in the 'topicCategories' array in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided data, we have tried 10000 calls on the API and did not find a single counterexample. We found 6556 examples in the requests data, with 5575 of them being distinct examples. The examples show that the 'maxWidth' values in the requests are consistently greater than the number of elements in the 'topicCategories' array in the responses.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent examples found, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The invariant holds for the tested cases, and the data provides strong evidence to support this conclusion.

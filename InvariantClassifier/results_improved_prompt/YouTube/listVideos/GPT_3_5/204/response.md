## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- It takes a query parameter 'id' which is an array of video ids.
- The response contains a 'pageInfo' object with a 'totalResults' field representing the total number of results in the result set.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.pageInfo.totalResults == size(input.id[])
This means that the total number of results in the response should be equal to the size of the array of video ids in the request.

## Analysis
- We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 28 examples in the requests data, with 19 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the totalResults in the response matches the size of the 'id' array in the request for all the examples.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples we have.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any other possible values for 'totalResults' or 'id', and the invariant makes semantic sense in the context of the API.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.pageInfo.totalResults == size(input.id[])' is classified as a true-positive. The confidence level is high due to the large number of examples and the consistency of the invariant across all examples.

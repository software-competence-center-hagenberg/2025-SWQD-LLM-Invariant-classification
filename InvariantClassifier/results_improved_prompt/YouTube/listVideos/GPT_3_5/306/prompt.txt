Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                statistics:
                  type: object
                  description: Statistics about the video, such as the number of times the video was viewed or liked.
                  properties:
                    dislikeCount:
                      type: string
                      description: The number of users who have indicated that they disliked the video by giving it a negative rating.
                  properties:
                    likeCount:
                      type: string
                      description: The number of users who have indicated that they liked the video by giving it a positive rating.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.statistics.dislikeCount == return.statistics.likeCount

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StringEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two String scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 42 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:
return.items.statistics.dislikeCount=0; return.items.statistics.likeCount=0

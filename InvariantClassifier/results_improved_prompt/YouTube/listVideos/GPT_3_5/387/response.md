## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a snippet and contentDetails object.
- The snippet object contains a thumbnails object, which in turn contains a maxres object with a width property.
- The contentDetails object contains a regionRestriction object with an allowed property, which is an array of region codes.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a comparison between the width of the maxres thumbnail and the size of the allowed region codes array.
- The invariant states: return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.width > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[])

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- There are 64 examples in the requests data, with 16 distinct examples.
- The example values of the variables support the invariant, showing that the width of the maxres thumbnail is consistently greater than the size of the allowed region codes array.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the width of the thumbnail or the region codes array that would contradict the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent examples found, along with the lack of explicit constraints in the specification, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

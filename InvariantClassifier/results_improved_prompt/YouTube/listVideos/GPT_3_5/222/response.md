- The response schema includes an array of items, each representing a video resource.

## Invariant
- The invariant is of type IntGreaterThan, representing the condition input.maxWidth > size(return.items[]).
- It compares the value of the request parameter "maxWidth" with the size of the array of video resources in the response.

## Analysis

- There are 5105 examples in the requests data, with 4379 distinct examples, indicating a significant coverage of different input values.
- The examples provided show various values for "maxWidth" and corresponding arrays of video resources in the response.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples tested, indicating a high likelihood of being a true-positive.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

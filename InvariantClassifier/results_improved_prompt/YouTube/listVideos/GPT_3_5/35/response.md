## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources.
- The response body contains a nested structure with properties such as 'items', 'snippet', and 'thumbnails'.
- The 'width' property is nested within 'default' and represents the width of a thumbnail image.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the width of the default thumbnail is always 120.

## Analysis
Based on the provided example value and the description of the API, it is reasonable to assume that the width of the default thumbnail is expected to be 120. The invariant has been tested with a large number of calls (10000) and has not been contradicted by any of the responses.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width == 120' is classified as a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is high due to the large number of calls and the consistency of the responses.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about the structure of the response for the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`.
- The response contains an array of items, each with a `snippet` object and a `topicDetails` object.
- The `snippet` object contains a `thumbnails` object, which in turn contains a `maxres` object with a `height` property.
- The `topicDetails` object contains a `topicCategories` array of strings.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a numeric divides invariant that checks if the height of the `maxres` thumbnail is divisible by the number of elements in the `topicCategories` array without a remainder.
- In other words, it checks if the height is a multiple of the number of topic categories.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- There are 3867 examples in the requests data, with 132 distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the height of the `maxres` thumbnail is 720, and the number of topic categories varies.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples provided.
- The semantics of the variables in the context of the invariant make sense.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the large number of examples tested, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

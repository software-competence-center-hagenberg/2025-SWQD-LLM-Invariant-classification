## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provided describes a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of resources, possibly filtered. The response schema includes a field `pageInfo` with a property `resultsPerPage` that represents the number of results included in the API response.

## Invariant
The invariant is `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 1`, which specifies that the number of results per page should be greater than or equal to 1.

## Analysis
Based on the provided information, the invariant `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 1` aligns with the expected behavior of the API. The response schema and the description of `resultsPerPage` indicate that it represents the number of results, and it is reasonable to expect this number to be greater than or equal to 1.

The 100 calls made to the API did not find a single counterexample, and there are 150 examples in the requests data, with 35 distinct examples, all of which satisfy the invariant. The example values of `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage` are 2, 3, 1, 44, and 45, all of which are greater than or equal to 1.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided information and the extensive testing, the invariant `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 1` is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

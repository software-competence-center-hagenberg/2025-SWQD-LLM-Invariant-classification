## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about the structure of the API response.
- The response contains an array of items, each with a snippet and contentDetails.
- The snippet contains thumbnails, and the maxres object within thumbnails has a width field.
- The contentDetails contains regionRestriction, which has a blocked field that is an array of region codes.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.width > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])
This invariant checks if the width of the maxres thumbnail is greater than the size of the blocked region codes.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on the API and found 330 examples in the requests data, with 23 distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the width of the maxres thumbnail is consistently greater than the size of the blocked region codes.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples, indicating that it is likely a true-positive.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

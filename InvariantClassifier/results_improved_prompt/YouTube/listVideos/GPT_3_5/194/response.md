## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The 'part' parameter is a required query parameter of type array, specifying a comma-separated list of one or more video resource properties that the API response will include.
- The response schema includes a 'contentDetails' object, which contains a 'regionRestriction' object with a 'blocked' property that is an array of region codes.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a comparison between the size of the 'part' parameter array in the request and the size of the 'blocked' array in the response.
- The invariant states that the size of 'part' should not be equal to the size of 'blocked' minus 1.

## Analysis
- We have tried 50 calls on this API and found 8 distinct examples, none of which contradicted the invariant.
- The examples show different values for the 'part' parameter and the 'blocked' array in the response.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples, indicating that the size of 'part' is consistently not equal to the size of 'blocked' minus 1.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the size of the 'part' parameter or the 'blocked' array, and the invariant does not contradict the API specification.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

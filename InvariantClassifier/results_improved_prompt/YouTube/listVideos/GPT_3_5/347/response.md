## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about the structure of the API response.
- The response contains an array of items, each with a snippet and contentDetails object.
- The snippet object contains a thumbnails object, which in turn contains a default object with a width property.
- The contentDetails object contains a regionRestriction object with an allowed property, which is an array of region codes.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[])
This invariant checks if the width of the default thumbnail is greater than the number of region codes allowed for the video.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 208 examples in the requests data, with 34 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples show that the width of the default thumbnail is consistently 120, and the number of region codes allowed varies from 1 to 7.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples we have collected.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the width of the default thumbnail or the number of region codes allowed, so the invariant is not contradicted by the specification.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent examples we have collected, along with the lack of explicit constraints in the specification, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with properties such as 'items', 'snippet', 'thumbnails', 'default', 'height', and 'contentDetails', 'regionRestriction', 'blocked'.

## Invariant
The invariant is as follows:
- return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])
- This invariant checks if the height of the default thumbnail is not equal to the size of the array of blocked region codes.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 474 examples in the requests data, with 27 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the height of the default thumbnail is consistently not equal to the size of the array of blocked region codes.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples we have, indicating a high likelihood of being a true-positive.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

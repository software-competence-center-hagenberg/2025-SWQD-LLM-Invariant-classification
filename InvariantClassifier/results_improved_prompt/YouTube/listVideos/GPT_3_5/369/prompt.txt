Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
      - name: id
        in: query
        description: Return videos with the given ids.
        required: false
        type: array
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            pageInfo:
              type: object
              description: Paging details for lists of resources, including total number of items available and number of resources returned in a single page.
              properties:
                totalResults:
                  type: integer
                  description: The total number of results in the result set.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.pageInfo.totalResults <= size(input.id[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntLessEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of <= between two long scalars. Prints as x <= y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 2740 examples in the requests data, with 1263 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.id=_aB9Tg6SRA0%2CsEKcCg_Jfos%C3%A7%2CQ5Fu3irzJ2A%2CbHEV9f9NLv4; return.pageInfo.totalResults=2

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation with a query parameter 'id' that accepts an array of video ids.
- The response schema includes a field 'pageInfo' with a subfield 'totalResults' of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.pageInfo.totalResults <= size(input.id[])
This means that the total number of results in the response should be less than or equal to the size of the input array of video ids.

## Analysis
Based on the provided information, the invariant seems to be a true-positive. The invariant holds for all 2740 examples found in the requests data, with 1263 distinct examples. The examples show that the total number of results in the response is always less than or equal to the size of the input array of video ids.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a true-positive with high confidence, as it holds for a large number of examples and is consistent with the behavior of the API.

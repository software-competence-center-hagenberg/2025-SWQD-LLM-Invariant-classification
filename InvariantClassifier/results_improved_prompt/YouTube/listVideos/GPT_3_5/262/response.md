## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing an 'id' (string) and a 'player' (object) with an 'embedHtml' (string) property.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the 'id' of a video is a substring of the 'embedHtml' used for video playback.

## Analysis
- The 'id' of a video is a unique identifier used by YouTube, and it is unlikely to be a substring of the 'embedHtml' for video playback.
- The 'embedHtml' is an <iframe> tag that embeds a player for video playback, and it is not semantically related to the 'id' of the video.
- Given the nature of the 'id' and 'embedHtml' properties, it is highly unlikely that the 'id' would be a substring of the 'embedHtml'.
- The specification does not suggest any relationship between the 'id' and 'embedHtml' that would support the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the semantic meaning of the 'id' and 'embedHtml' properties, and the lack of evidence from the specification to support the invariant, the invariant is classified as a false-positive.

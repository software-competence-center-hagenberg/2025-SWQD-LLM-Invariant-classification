## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The operation takes a query parameter 'id', which is an array of video ids.
- The response contains a 'pageInfo' object with a 'resultsPerPage' field, indicating the number of results included in the API response.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage <= size(input.id[])', which states that the number of results per page should be less than or equal to the size of the 'id' array in the request.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- We found 2740 examples in the requests data, with 1263 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the 'resultsPerPage' value is consistently less than or equal to the size of the 'id' array in the request.
- The invariant makes semantic sense in the context of the API, as it ensures that the number of results per page does not exceed the number of requested video ids.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the relationship between 'resultsPerPage' and the size of the 'id' array.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing, the invariant 'return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage <= size(input.id[])' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

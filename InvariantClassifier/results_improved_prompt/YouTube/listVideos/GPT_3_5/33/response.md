## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about the REST endpoint and the structure of the response.
- The 'liveBroadcastContent' field is a string type with an enum of ['none', 'upcoming', 'live', 'completed'].

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the 'liveBroadcastContent' field in the response is equal to 'none'.

## Analysis
- The invariant is checking a string variable 'liveBroadcastContent' for a specific value 'none'.
- The swagger definition confirms that 'liveBroadcastContent' can indeed take on the value 'none' as one of the enum values.
- The example provided also shows that the 'liveBroadcastContent' field can be 'none'.
- The number of examples (278) and distinct examples (1) found in the requests data also support the likelihood of this invariant being true.

## Conclusion
Based on the information from the swagger definition, the example value, and the number of examples found, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The 'maxHeight' parameter is an integer in the query, with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each with a 'snippet' object containing a 'tags' array of strings.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxHeight > size(return.items.snippet.tags[])
This means that the value of 'maxHeight' in the request should be greater than the number of tags in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 9890 distinct examples found in the requests data. The examples show that for each request, the value of 'maxHeight' is indeed greater than the number of tags in the response.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a true-positive. The confidence level is high due to the large number of examples (9890 distinct examples) and the consistency of the invariant across all tested requests.

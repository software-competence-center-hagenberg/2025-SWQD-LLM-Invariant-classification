## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provided describes a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources, including details about videos and their content.
- The response body contains nested objects and arrays, including the 'snippet' and 'contentDetails' objects.
- The 'thumbnails' object within 'snippet' contains a 'default' object with a 'width' property.
- The 'regionRestriction' object within 'contentDetails' contains a 'blocked' array of region codes.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the 'width' property within 'thumbnails.default' should be greater than the size of the 'blocked' array within 'regionRestriction'.
- The invariant type is 'IntGreaterThan', representing an invariant of > between two long scalars.

## Analysis
- The invariant compares the width of a thumbnail with the size of the blocked region array, which seems to be a logical comparison.
- The examples provided show that the width of the thumbnail is 120, and the size of the blocked array varies.
- The examples do not contradict the invariant, as the width is always greater than the size of the blocked array.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the response body, the invariant appears to be a true-positive. The comparison between the width and the size of the blocked array holds for the given examples and aligns with the semantics of the variables involved.

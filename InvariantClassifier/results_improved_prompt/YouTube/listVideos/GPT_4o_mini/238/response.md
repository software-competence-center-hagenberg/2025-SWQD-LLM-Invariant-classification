### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the `actualStartTime` field is a string that represents the time the broadcast actually started. The format of this string is not explicitly defined in the provided excerpt, but the examples suggest that it follows the ISO 8601 format for date and time.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of `actualStartTime` is always 20 characters. This implies that every valid `actualStartTime` string returned by the API must conform to this fixed length.

### Analysis
The examples provided show the following values:
1. `2022-10-04T16:59:53Z` (20 characters)
2. `2022-09-27T14:07:26Z` (20 characters)
3. `2022-10-01T10:00:14Z` (20 characters)
4. `2022-09-08T16:00:11Z` (20 characters)
5. `2022-09-29T19:00:10Z` (20 characters)

All of these examples have a length of 20 characters, which aligns with the invariant. The fact that 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample further supports the validity of the invariant. However, it is important to consider the format of the `actualStartTime` string. The ISO 8601 format for a date-time string typically includes the date, time, and timezone, which can be represented as `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. This format indeed results in a length of 20 characters.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant holds true for all tested examples and the format of the `actualStartTime` string is consistent with the invariant's requirement, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the extensive testing and the nature of the string format.

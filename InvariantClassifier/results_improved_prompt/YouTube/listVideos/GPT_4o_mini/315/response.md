### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the `maxHeight` parameter is an optional integer that can take values starting from 72 up to 8192. The response schema includes a `height` property under `thumbnails.maxres`, which is also an integer but does not specify a range or constraints.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxHeight` should not equal `return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.height`, which is expressed as `input.maxHeight != return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.height`.

### Analysis
1. **Parameter Constraints**: The `maxHeight` parameter can take a wide range of values (from 72 to 8192). The `height` of the thumbnail is not constrained by the Swagger definition, meaning it could potentially match `maxHeight`.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests that it holds under the tested conditions. Additionally, there are 1309 examples with 1014 distinct values, all showing that `maxHeight` is not equal to `height` in the responses.
3. **Potential for Equality**: However, since the `height` of the thumbnail is not defined to be distinct from `maxHeight`, there is a possibility that in some cases, `height` could equal `maxHeight`. The absence of counterexamples does not guarantee that such cases do not exist, especially since the API could return different values under different conditions or inputs not covered in the tests.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the relationship between two variables without explicit constraints on the response variable (`height`), and considering the possibility that they could be equal, the invariant is likely a **false-positive**. The empirical evidence is strong, but the lack of explicit constraints on `height` means we cannot definitively conclude that the invariant will always hold. 

Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with a confidence of 0.85.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource has properties including `publicStatsViewable` and `selfDeclaredMadeForKids`, both of which are boolean values.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the values of `publicStatsViewable` and `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` are equal (i.e., `return.status.publicStatsViewable == return.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids`). This means that if one is true, the other must also be true, and if one is false, the other must also be false.

### Analysis
1. **Boolean Properties**: Both properties are boolean, which means they can only take on the values `true` or `false`. The invariant suggests a strict equality between these two properties.
2. **API Behavior**: The Swagger definition does not indicate that these two properties are inherently linked or should always have the same value. They represent different aspects of the video: `publicStatsViewable` indicates whether extended statistics can be viewed publicly, while `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` indicates whether the video is declared as made for kids.
3. **Testing**: The invariant has been tested with 1000 calls without finding a counterexample, and there are 4 examples in the request data that support the invariant. However, the fact that no counterexamples were found does not guarantee that the invariant is universally true, especially since the specification does not enforce this relationship.
4. **Potential for False-Positive**: Given that the properties represent different concepts, it is plausible that there could be cases where one is true and the other is false. For instance, a video could be publicStatsViewable but not made for kids, or vice versa. The lack of explicit linkage in the API documentation suggests that this invariant may not hold universally.

### Conclusion
While the invariant has not been disproven in the testing phase, the lack of explicit correlation in the API specification between the two boolean properties leads to the conclusion that this invariant is likely a false-positive. The properties can logically have different values based on the semantics of what they represent. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** with a confidence of 0.85 due to the lack of explicit contradiction in the specification but the potential for differing values based on their definitions.

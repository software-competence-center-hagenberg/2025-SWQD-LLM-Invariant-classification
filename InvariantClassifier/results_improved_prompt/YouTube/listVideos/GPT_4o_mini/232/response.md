### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that retrieves a list of YouTube videos, including their content details. Within the content details, there is a property called `regionRestriction`, which has a property `blocked` that is an array of strings. Each string in this array represents a country code where the video is blocked. The description states that if the `blocked` property is present and contains an empty list, the video is viewable in all countries.

### Invariant
The invariant states that all elements of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]` have a length of 2. This means that every country code in the `blocked` array should be exactly 2 characters long.

### Analysis
1. **Length of Country Codes**: The country codes used in the `blocked` array are likely to follow the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard, which specifies that country codes are always 2 letters long. This aligns with the invariant that all elements have LENGTH=2.
2. **Testing Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 1864 examples with 40 distinct examples, all of which conform to the invariant.
3. **Specification Consistency**: The Swagger definition does not contradict the invariant, as it does not specify any country codes that would be of different lengths.

### Conclusion
Given the alignment of the invariant with the likely standard for country codes, the extensive testing without counterexamples, and the lack of contradictions in the specification, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the strong evidence supporting the invariant.

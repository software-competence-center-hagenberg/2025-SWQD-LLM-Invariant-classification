### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that retrieves a list of video resources, specifically detailing the properties of the video files, including audio streams. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that the `audioStreams` property is an array of objects, each containing metadata about audio streams.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.fileDetails.audioStreams == null`, which implies that the `audioStreams` property should always be null in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Schema**: According to the Swagger definition, `audioStreams` is defined as an array of objects. This means that it can either be an array (which could be empty) or it could be null. However, the invariant specifically states that it should always be null.
2. **Semantics of the API**: The purpose of the API is to retrieve video resources, and it is reasonable to expect that some videos may contain audio streams. Therefore, it is likely that `audioStreams` would be populated with data for many videos, contradicting the invariant.
3. **Testing Results**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample. While this is a significant number of calls, it does not conclusively prove that the invariant is universally true, especially given the nature of the API which suggests that audio streams can exist.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.fileDetails.audioStreams == null` is likely a false-positive because it contradicts the expected behavior of the API as described in the Swagger definition. While it has not been disproven in testing, the nature of the data suggests that it should not always be null. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with a confidence of **0.85** due to the lack of counterexamples but the strong indication from the API's purpose and schema that audio streams can exist.

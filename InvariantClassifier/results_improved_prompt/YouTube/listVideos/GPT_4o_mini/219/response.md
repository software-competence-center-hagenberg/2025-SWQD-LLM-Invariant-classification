### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies that the `maxResults` parameter is an integer that indicates the maximum number of items to be returned in the response. It has a minimum value of 1 and a maximum length of 50. The response contains an array of items, which are video resources.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxResults >= size(return.items[])`, meaning that the number of items returned in the response should not exceed the value specified in the `maxResults` parameter.

### Analysis
Given that the `maxResults` parameter is intended to limit the number of items returned, it is logical to expect that the number of items in the response (`return.items[]`) should not exceed the value of `maxResults`. The fact that the invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls and no counterexamples have been found strongly supports its validity. Additionally, the invariant aligns with the purpose of the `maxResults` parameter as described in the Swagger definition.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant `input.maxResults >= size(return.items[])` is a true-positive. It holds for every valid request on the API as it is consistent with the intended functionality of the `maxResults` parameter, and the extensive testing without counterexamples further confirms its correctness.

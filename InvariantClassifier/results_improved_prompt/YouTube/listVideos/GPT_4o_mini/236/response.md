### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an endpoint that retrieves video details, including live streaming metadata. The `actualEndTime` field is specified as a string that represents the time the broadcast ended, formatted in ISO 8601.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime` is always 20 characters. This implies that every valid timestamp returned by this field must conform to a specific format that results in a string of exactly 20 characters.

### Analysis
The ISO 8601 format for timestamps typically looks like this: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. In this format:
- `YYYY` is 4 digits for the year
- `MM` is 2 digits for the month
- `DD` is 2 digits for the day
- `T` is a literal character
- `HH` is 2 digits for the hour
- `MM` is 2 digits for the minute
- `SS` is 2 digits for the second
- `Z` indicates UTC time

When we count the characters in this format, we find:
- 4 (year) + 1 (T) + 2 (month) + 1 (day) + 1 (hour) + 1 (minute) + 1 (second) + 1 (Z) = 20 characters.

Given that all the example values provided conform to this format, and considering that no counterexamples were found in 10,000 calls, it strongly suggests that the invariant holds true for the API's response.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the Swagger definition and the provided examples, the invariant that `LENGTH(return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime)==20` is a true-positive. The format of the timestamp inherently ensures that it will always be 20 characters long, and the lack of counterexamples further supports this conclusion. 

**Verdict:** true-positive
**Confidence:** 0.95

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the `maxWidth` parameter is an optional integer that specifies the maximum height for the player, with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192. The response includes a `pageInfo` object that contains `totalResults`, which is an integer representing the total number of results available.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxWidth > return.pageInfo.totalResults`, meaning that the value of `maxWidth` in the request must always be greater than the total number of results returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `maxWidth` parameter is related to the display size of the video player, while `totalResults` indicates how many results are available. There is no inherent relationship between the size of the player and the number of results returned. 
2. **Counterexamples**: Although no counterexamples were found in the 100 calls made, the lack of counterexamples does not necessarily validate the invariant. The relationship between `maxWidth` and `totalResults` is not defined in the API specification, and it is possible for `totalResults` to be greater than or equal to `maxWidth` in different scenarios. For instance, if there are many results available, `totalResults` could exceed `maxWidth`, which would contradict the invariant.
3. **Distinct Examples**: The 76 examples of requests do not provide sufficient evidence that the invariant holds universally. The examples provided show that `maxWidth` values are consistently greater than `totalResults`, but this could be coincidental or limited to the specific cases tested.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant suggests a relationship that is not supported by the API specification and that the variables involved do not have a logical connection, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is moderate, at 0.75, due to the lack of counterexamples but the clear semantic disconnect between the two variables.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                snippet:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video, including title, description, uploader, thumbnails and category.
                  properties:
                    localized:
                      type: object
                      description: Localized versions of certain video properties (e.g. title).
                      properties:
                        title:
                          type: string
                          description: Localized version of the video's title.
                  properties:
                    title:
                      type: string
                      description: The video's title. @mutable youtube.videos.insert youtube.videos.update


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.snippet.localized.title == return.snippet.title

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StringEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two String scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 500 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 2105 examples in the requests data, with 706 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.items.snippet.localized.title=THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SIDEMEN CHARITY MATCH; output.items.snippet.title=THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SIDEMEN CHARITY MATCH
output.items.snippet.localized.title=ratios are a nightmare; output.items.snippet.title=ratios are a nightmare
output.items.snippet.localized.title=Saitama lifting Thorâ€™s hammer? #anime #saitama #marvel; output.items.snippet.title=Saitama lifting Thorâ€™s hammer? #anime #saitama #marvel
output.items.snippet.localized.title=BREAKING 100 RULES IN 24 HOURS!!; output.items.snippet.title=BREAKING 100 RULES IN 24 HOURS!!
output.items.snippet.localized.title=NEW TIKTOK TREND ðŸ¤? CLODETT #shorts; output.items.snippet.title=NEW TIKTOK TREND ðŸ¤? CLODETT #shorts

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that retrieves a list of YouTube videos, including their content details and snippet information. The relevant properties for this invariant are:
- `contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked`: An array of region codes where the video is blocked.
- `snippet.tags`: An array of keyword tags associated with the video.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `blocked` array is not equal to the size of the `tags` array: `size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])-1 != size(return.snippet.tags[])-1`. This simplifies to checking if the sizes of the two arrays are different.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Relevance**: The `blocked` array and the `tags` array represent different concepts. The `blocked` array indicates regions where the video cannot be viewed, while the `tags` array provides keywords related to the video's content. There is no inherent relationship between the number of blocked regions and the number of tags associated with a video.
2. **Testing Results**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests that it holds true for the tested cases. However, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that it will hold true for all possible cases, especially given the semantic disconnection between the two arrays.
3. **Specification Consideration**: The Swagger definition does not impose any constraints that would inherently link the sizes of these two arrays. Therefore, it is possible for both arrays to have the same size in some cases, even if that has not been observed in the tested examples.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic disconnection between the `blocked` and `tags` arrays, and the fact that the invariant does not reflect a necessary relationship between them, it is likely that this invariant is a false-positive. The absence of counterexamples in the tested data does not sufficiently support the claim that this invariant will hold for all valid requests. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

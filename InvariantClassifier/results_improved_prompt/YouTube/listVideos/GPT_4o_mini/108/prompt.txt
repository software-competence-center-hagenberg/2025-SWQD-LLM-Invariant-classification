This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:

                      description: DEPRECATED Region restriction of the video.
                      properties:
                        allowed:
                          type: array
                          description: A list of region codes that identify countries where the video is viewable. If this property is present and a country is not listed in its value, then the video is blocked from appearing in that country. If this property is present and contains an empty list, the video is blocked in all countries.
                          items:
                            type: string
              items:

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.snippet.channelId in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.sequenceString.MemberString
Invariant description: Represents String scalars that are always members of a sequence of String values. Prints as x in y[] where x is a String scalar and y[] is a sequence of String.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

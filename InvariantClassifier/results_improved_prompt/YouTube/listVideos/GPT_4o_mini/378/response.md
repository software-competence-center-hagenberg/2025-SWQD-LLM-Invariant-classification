### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of videos, with a response schema that includes an array of items. Each item has a status object containing two boolean properties: `madeForKids` and `selfDeclaredMadeForKids`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the values of `madeForKids` and `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` are equal for every response from this endpoint: `return.status.madeForKids == return.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids`. This invariant is of type `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual`, indicating a comparison between two scalar values.

### Analysis
- The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which strongly suggests that the invariant holds true for the current implementation of the API.
- The invariant is supported by the examples provided, where both instances show that when `madeForKids` is `false`, `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` is also `false`, and when `madeForKids` is `true`, `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` is also `true`.
- There is no indication in the Swagger definition that these two fields can diverge in value, and the description does not contradict the invariant.
- The fact that there are only 2 distinct examples, but they consistently support the invariant, further strengthens the case for it being a true-positive.

### Conclusion
Given the strong evidence from the testing and the examples, along with the lack of contradictory information in the API specification, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the extensive testing and consistent results observed.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that retrieves a list of video resources from YouTube. The `part` parameter is required and specifies which properties of the video resource to include in the response. The response includes a `pageInfo` object that contains `totalResults`, which indicates the total number of results available.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the total number of results returned (`return.pageInfo.totalResults`) is not equal to the size of the input `part` array minus one (`size(input.part[]) - 1`). This is represented as `return.pageInfo.totalResults != size(input.part[]) - 1`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the total number of results should not equal the number of properties requested (in `part`) minus one. This implies that for every valid request, the total results should be at least one more than the number of properties requested.
2. **API Behavior**: The API's behavior is not explicitly defined in the Swagger documentation regarding how `totalResults` relates to the `part` parameter. The `totalResults` indicates the total number of video resources available, not necessarily tied to the number of properties requested.
3. **Testing Results**: The testing conducted involved 50 calls, with no counterexamples found. This suggests that the invariant holds true for the tested cases. However, the sample size is relatively small, and the invariant's correctness is not guaranteed without a clear relationship defined in the API documentation.
4. **Potential for False-Positive**: The invariant could be a false-positive if there are scenarios where the total number of results matches the size of the `part` array minus one. For instance, if the API returns a specific number of results based on the properties requested, it could lead to a situation where the invariant does not hold.

### Conclusion
While the invariant has not been contradicted in the tested cases, the lack of explicit documentation linking `totalResults` to the `part` parameter raises concerns about its validity. Therefore, without further evidence or a larger sample size, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** due to the potential for it to not hold in all cases. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.75

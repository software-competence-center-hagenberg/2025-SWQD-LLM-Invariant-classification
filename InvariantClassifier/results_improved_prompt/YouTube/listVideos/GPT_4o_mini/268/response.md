### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource contains a `player` object with two properties: `embedHeight` (a string) and `embedHtml` (also a string). The `embedHtml` property is described as an `<iframe>` tag that embeds a player for video playback.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.player.embedHeight` is a substring of `return.player.embedHtml`. This means that the value of `embedHeight` should appear within the value of `embedHtml`.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Relationship**: The `embedHeight` is likely to represent the height of the video player, while `embedHtml` contains the HTML code for embedding the player. It is plausible that the height value could be included in the HTML string, especially if the HTML is dynamically generated based on the video properties.

2. **Testing Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests a strong correlation between the two fields under the tested conditions. Additionally, the presence of 21,277 examples, with 17,881 distinct examples, further supports the validity of the invariant.

3. **Specification Considerations**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly contradict the invariant, and it does not mention any cases where `embedHeight` would not be a substring of `embedHtml`. 

### Conclusion
Given the strong evidence from testing and the semantic relationship between the two fields, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. The invariant holds under the tested conditions and aligns with the expected behavior of the API based on the provided schema.

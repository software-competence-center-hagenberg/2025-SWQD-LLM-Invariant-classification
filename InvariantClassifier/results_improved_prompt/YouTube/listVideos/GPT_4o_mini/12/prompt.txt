Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
      - name: id
        in: query
        description: Return videos with the given ids.
        required: false
        type: array
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                topicDetails:
                  type: object
                  description: Freebase topic information related to the video.
                  properties:
                    topicCategories:
                      type: array
                      description: A list of Wikipedia URLs that provide a high-level description of the video's content.
                      items:
                        type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: size(input.id[]) == size(return.topicDetails.topicCategories[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two long scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 2 examples in the requests data, with 2 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 2 example values of the variables:
input.id=eqP_Q7cgwJc; output.items.topicDetails.topicCategories=["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Knowledge"]
input.id=Z-JkdGYAHl4%2CnC327id4aUM; output.items.topicDetails.topicCategories=["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Association_football","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport"]

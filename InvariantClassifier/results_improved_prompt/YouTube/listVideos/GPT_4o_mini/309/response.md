### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an endpoint that retrieves a list of video resources, which may include live streaming details. The property `scheduledEndTime` is a string that indicates when a broadcast is scheduled to end. The definition also states that if this property is empty or not present, the broadcast continues indefinitely.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `scheduledEndTime` should always equal `"2022-10-04T18:00:00Z"`. This is a very specific value for a string variable that is expected to represent a time.

### Analysis
1. **Specificity of the Invariant**: The invariant is very specific, asserting that `scheduledEndTime` can only be one particular value. However, the Swagger definition does not restrict `scheduledEndTime` to only this value. It allows for the possibility of other values or even the absence of the property (which indicates an indefinite broadcast).
2. **Counterexamples**: Although 1000 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the fact that the API allows for other values (as indicated in the Swagger definition) means that the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold true for all valid requests. The presence of only one distinct example (the specified date) does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that this is the only possible value.
3. **Semantics**: The semantics of `scheduledEndTime` suggest that it can represent various times depending on the broadcast schedule. Thus, asserting that it can only be one specific time is semantically incorrect.

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition allows for multiple possible values for `scheduledEndTime`, the invariant that it must equal a specific timestamp is incorrect. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.9

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies that the `projection` property of `contentDetails` can take on one of two values: `rectangular` or `360`. Both of these values have a length of 11 characters. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of `return.contentDetails.projection` is always 11. 

### Analysis
1. **Length of Values**: The two possible values for `projection` are `rectangular` (length 11) and `360` (length 3). Since `360` does not satisfy the invariant (length is not 11), the invariant cannot hold for all valid responses. 
2. **Counterexamples**: Although there were no counterexamples found in the 100 calls made, the existence of a valid value (`360`) that contradicts the invariant indicates that it is not universally true. 
3. **Distinct Examples**: The fact that there is only one distinct example (`rectangular`) among 427 examples does not provide sufficient evidence to claim that the invariant is true for all possible responses. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant states a fixed length of 11, but the specification allows for a value (`360`) that has a different length, the invariant is a false-positive. The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

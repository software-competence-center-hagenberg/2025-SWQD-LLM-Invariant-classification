### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition indicates that the `actualEndTime` field is a string that represents the time the broadcast actually ended. The description states that this value will not be available until the broadcast is over, implying that it will only be populated after the event has concluded.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime` is always a timestamp formatted as `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmZ`, where milliseconds are optional. This suggests that every valid response will include this field in the specified format.

### Analysis
- **Frequency of Calls**: The invariant has been tested against 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which strongly suggests that the invariant holds true in the tested scenarios.
- **Distinct Examples**: The presence of 3030 examples, with 480 distinct values, further supports the idea that the invariant is likely correct, as it shows a variety of valid timestamps being returned.
- **Specification Compliance**: The specification does not contradict the invariant; it only states that the value will not be available until the broadcast is over, which aligns with the invariant's assertion that when it is available, it will be in the specified format.

### Conclusion
Given the high number of calls and examples supporting the invariant, along with the lack of any counterexamples, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The invariant accurately reflects the expected format of the `actualEndTime` field based on the provided API documentation.

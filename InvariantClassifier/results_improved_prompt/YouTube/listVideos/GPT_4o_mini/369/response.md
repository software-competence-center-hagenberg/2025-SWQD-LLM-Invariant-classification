### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving videos from the YouTube API. The `id` parameter is an optional query parameter that can take an array of video IDs. The response includes a `pageInfo` object that contains `totalResults`, which indicates the total number of results available based on the provided IDs.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the total number of results returned (`return.pageInfo.totalResults`) is less than or equal to the size of the input array of IDs (`input.id[]`). In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

`return.pageInfo.totalResults <= size(input.id[])`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the number of results returned by the API cannot exceed the number of IDs requested. This is logically sound because if you request a certain number of IDs, the maximum number of results you can receive should not exceed that number.

2. **Testing Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 2,740 examples with 1,263 distinct cases, all supporting the invariant. This extensive testing provides strong evidence that the invariant holds true for the API's behavior.

3. **Specification Compliance**: The Swagger definition does not contradict this invariant. It does not specify that the API can return more results than the number of IDs provided, which further supports the validity of the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the logical reasoning, the extensive testing with no counterexamples, and the compliance with the API specification, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The invariant is likely to hold for all valid requests to the API, as it aligns with the expected behavior of the endpoint.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies that the `maxResults` parameter is an integer that indicates the maximum number of items to be returned. It has a minimum value of 1 and a maximum length of 50. The `regionRestriction.blocked` property is an array that lists countries where the video is blocked. If this property is present and contains an empty list, the video is viewable in all countries.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxResults != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])-1`. This means that the value of `maxResults` should not equal the size of the `blocked` array minus one.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `maxResults` parameter indicates how many items should be returned, while `regionRestriction.blocked` indicates the countries where the video is blocked. The invariant compares these two values.
2. **Semantic Relevance**: The comparison between `maxResults` and the size of the `blocked` array does not have a clear semantic relationship. The number of items returned (`maxResults`) does not logically correlate with the number of blocked regions. The `maxResults` parameter is about the number of items in the response, while `regionRestriction.blocked` is about the restrictions on those items. 
3. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests that it may hold true in the tested scenarios. However, the lack of semantic relevance raises concerns about the invariant's validity in a broader context.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of semantic connection between `maxResults` and the size of the `blocked` array, the invariant is likely a false-positive. It may hold true in the tested cases, but it does not logically apply to all possible scenarios of the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** with a confidence of 0.85 due to the extensive testing but the semantic mismatch.

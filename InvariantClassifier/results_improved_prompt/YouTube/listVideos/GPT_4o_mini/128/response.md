### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource can contain various details, including `contentDetails` and `liveStreamingDetails`. 

- `contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked`: This is an array of region codes where the video is blocked. If this property is present and contains an empty list, the video is viewable in all countries.
- `liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime`: This is a string representing the actual end time of a live broadcast.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`. This implies that the actual end time of a live stream is somehow related to the regions where the video is blocked.

### Analysis
1. **Semantics**: The two fields in question (`actualEndTime` and `blocked`) serve different purposes. The `actualEndTime` indicates when a live stream ended, while `blocked` indicates regions where the video cannot be viewed. There is no inherent relationship between the time a video ends and the regions where it is blocked. 
2. **Specification**: The specification does not suggest that the `actualEndTime` would ever correspond to any of the region codes listed in `blocked`. The `blocked` array is meant to contain country codes, while `actualEndTime` is a timestamp string. 
3. **Testing**: Although 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the lack of counterexamples does not imply that the invariant is correct. The semantic mismatch suggests that the invariant is unlikely to hold in general.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic mismatch between `actualEndTime` (a timestamp) and `blocked` (an array of region codes), and the lack of any logical connection between these two fields, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear distinction in the types and purposes of the fields involved.

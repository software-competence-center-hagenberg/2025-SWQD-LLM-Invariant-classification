### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the `actualStartTime` field is a string that represents the time the broadcast actually started. It is noted that this value will not be available until the broadcast begins, which implies that it may not always be present in the response.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualStartTime` is always a timestamp formatted as `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmZ`. This suggests that every time this field is present, it must conform to this specific timestamp format.

### Analysis
1. **Presence of the Field**: The Swagger definition mentions that `actualStartTime` will not be available until the broadcast begins. This implies that there may be cases where `actualStartTime` is not present in the response at all, which would contradict the invariant if we assume it must always be a timestamp.
2. **Format of the Field**: The examples provided conform to the expected timestamp format, which strengthens the case for the invariant. However, the fact that the field may not be present at all in some responses (as indicated by the Swagger definition) means that the invariant cannot hold universally.
3. **Counterexamples**: Even though 10,000 calls did not yield a counterexample, the specification itself suggests that there could be cases where `actualStartTime` is absent, which would not satisfy the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant requires `actualStartTime` to always be a timestamp, but the Swagger definition indicates that it may not be present at all times, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the explicit mention in the API specification regarding the potential absence of the field.

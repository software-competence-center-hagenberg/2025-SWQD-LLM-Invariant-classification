Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
      - name: id
        in: query
        description: Return videos with the given ids.
        required: false
        type: array
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                snippet:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video, including title, description, uploader, thumbnails and category.
                  properties:
                    thumbnails:
                      type: object
                      description: Internal representation of thumbnails for a YouTube resource.
                      properties:
                        standard:
                          type: object
                          description: A thumbnail is an image representing a YouTube resource.
                          properties:
                            height:
                              type: integer
                              description: (Optional) Height of the thumbnail image.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.height > size(input.id[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 521 examples in the requests data, with 325 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.id=MRazr0gkBPw; output.items.snippet.thumbnails.standard.height=480
input.id=3ngxKydsrQU; output.items.snippet.thumbnails.standard.height=480
input.id=gTgsOTUjDcA%2CrUxyKA_-grg; output.items.snippet.thumbnails.standard.height=480
input.id=uSjS_l3wGu8; output.items.snippet.thumbnails.standard.height=480
input.id=SUV5pNMvXhU%2CxiX9zveLSRA%2CT7LGxxU2PhA; output.items.snippet.thumbnails.standard.height=480

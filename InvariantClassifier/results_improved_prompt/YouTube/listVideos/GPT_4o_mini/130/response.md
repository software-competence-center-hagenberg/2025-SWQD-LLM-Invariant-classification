### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema includes properties for `contentDetails` and `liveStreamingDetails`. Specifically, `contentDetails` has a `regionRestriction` object with a `blocked` array that lists countries where the video is blocked. The `liveStreamingDetails` includes a `scheduledStartTime` string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledStartTime` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`. This means that the scheduled start time of a live stream is expected to be found within the array of blocked regions.

### Analysis
1. **Semantics**: The `scheduledStartTime` is a timestamp indicating when a live stream is set to start, while `blocked` contains country codes that indicate where the video is not viewable. There is no semantic relationship between a timestamp and a country code; thus, it does not make sense for a timestamp to be a member of an array of country codes.
2. **Specification**: The Swagger definition does not imply any relationship between `scheduledStartTime` and `blocked` values. The invariant seems to incorrectly assume a connection where none exists.
3. **Testing**: Although 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the lack of counterexamples does not validate the invariant due to the semantic mismatch. The invariant is fundamentally flawed regardless of the test results.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic mismatch between the types of data being compared (a timestamp vs. country codes), the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear distinction between the data types involved.

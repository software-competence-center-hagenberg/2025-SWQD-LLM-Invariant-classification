Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
      - name: maxResults
        in: query
        description: The *maxResults* parameter specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the result set. *Note:* This parameter is supported for use in conjunction with the myRating and chart parameters, but it is not supported for use in conjunction with the id parameter.
        required: false
        type: integer
        minimum: 1
        maxLength: 50
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            pageInfo:
              type: object
              description: Paging details for lists of resources, including total number of items available and number of resources returned in a single page.
              properties:
                resultsPerPage:
                  type: integer
                  description: The number of results included in the API response.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.maxResults == return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two long scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 3945 examples in the requests data, with 50 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.maxResults=26; output.pageInfo.resultsPerPage=26
input.maxResults=12; output.pageInfo.resultsPerPage=12
input.maxResults=36; output.pageInfo.resultsPerPage=36
input.maxResults=7; output.pageInfo.resultsPerPage=7
input.maxResults=1; output.pageInfo.resultsPerPage=1

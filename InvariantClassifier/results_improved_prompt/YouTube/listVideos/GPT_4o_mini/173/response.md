### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources with various properties specified by the `part` query parameter. The `part` parameter is required and can include multiple properties, which affects the response structure.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.height % size(input.part[]) == 0`. This means that the height of the thumbnail (an integer) should be divisible by the number of elements in the `part` array without a remainder.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `input.part[]`: This is an array of strings representing the properties requested in the API call.
   - `return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.height`: This is an integer representing the height of the thumbnail image returned in the API response.

2. **Contextual Relevance**: The invariant suggests a mathematical relationship between the number of requested properties and the height of the thumbnail. However, there is no indication in the API documentation that the height of the thumbnail is related to the number of properties requested. The height is likely a fixed value based on the thumbnail's design and not influenced by the `part` parameter.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 50 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, the invariant's validity is questionable because it implies a relationship that does not logically follow from the API's specification. The height of the thumbnail should not depend on the number of properties requested.

4. **Distinct Examples**: The examples provided show that the height is consistently 180 across different requests, but this does not support the invariant's claim. The height being constant does not imply that it is divisible by the size of the `part` array in a meaningful way.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant suggests a mathematical relationship that does not logically follow from the API's behavior and the lack of any specification supporting this relationship, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive**. The invariant does not hold true for every valid request on the API, as the height of the thumbnail is not semantically related to the number of requested properties. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

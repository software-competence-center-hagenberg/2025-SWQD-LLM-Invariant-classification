### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves video resources with various properties specified by the `part` parameter. The `contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked` property is an array that lists countries where the video is blocked. If this property is present and contains an empty list, it indicates that the video is viewable in all countries.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `input.part[]` array (the request parameter) is not equal to the size of the `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]` array (the response property). This is represented as `size(input.part[]) != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `input.part[]` parameter specifies which properties of the video resource to include in the response. The `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]` property specifically relates to the region restrictions of the video. The number of properties requested in `input.part[]` does not logically correlate with the number of countries listed in `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`.

2. **Semantic Relevance**: The `input.part[]` parameter can include various properties, and its size can vary independently of the `blocked[]` array size. For example, one request could ask for only the `contentDetails`, while another could ask for multiple properties, yet both could return the same or different sizes of the `blocked[]` array.

3. **Counterexamples**: Although no counterexamples were found in 100 calls, the nature of the invariant suggests that it is possible for the sizes to be equal in certain scenarios. For instance, if `input.part[]` has one element and `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]` also has one element, the invariant would not hold.

4. **Distinct Examples**: The 20 examples provided show a variety of `input.part[]` values and their corresponding `blocked[]` outputs. However, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant will always hold, especially given the independent nature of the two variables.

### Conclusion
The invariant `size(input.part[]) != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])` is likely a false-positive because the sizes of the two arrays can be equal in certain cases, despite the lack of counterexamples in the tested calls. The relationship between the request parameter and the response property does not inherently enforce that their sizes must differ, leading to the conclusion that this invariant does not hold universally for all valid requests.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. Each video resource can include `contentDetails` and `topicDetails`. 

- **contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked**: This property is an array that lists region codes where the video is blocked. If this property is present and empty, it indicates the video is viewable in all countries.
- **topicDetails.topicCategories**: This property is also an array that contains Wikipedia URLs related to the video's content.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `blocked` array (from `contentDetails.regionRestriction`) is not equal to the size of the `topicCategories` array (from `topicDetails`). 

### Analysis
1. **Semantics**: The sizes of these two arrays represent different aspects of the video. The `blocked` array indicates restrictions based on geography, while the `topicCategories` array provides categorization of the video's content. There is no inherent relationship between the two arrays that would guarantee their sizes are different. 
2. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 50 calls, and no counterexamples were found, which suggests that it may hold true for the tested cases. However, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant is universally true. 
3. **Distinct Examples**: The presence of 10 examples, with 8 distinct, indicates some variability, but it does not provide strong evidence that the sizes of these arrays will always differ. 
4. **Specification**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that the sizes of these arrays must be different, nor does it provide any constraints that would support the invariant as a requirement. 

### Conclusion
Given the lack of a semantic relationship between the two arrays and the fact that the invariant is not explicitly supported by the API specification, it is likely that this invariant is a false-positive. The absence of counterexamples in the limited testing does not sufficiently prove that the invariant holds universally. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

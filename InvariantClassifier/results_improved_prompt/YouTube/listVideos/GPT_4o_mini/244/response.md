### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the `recordingDate` is a string representing the date and time when the video was recorded. The format of the date-time string is likely to follow the ISO 8601 standard, which typically looks like `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `recordingDate` string is always 20 characters. 

### Analysis
1. **Format of the Date-Time String**: The examples provided (e.g., `2022-09-04T00:00:00Z`) conform to the ISO 8601 format. This format indeed has a fixed length of 20 characters, including the date, time, and the 'Z' character indicating UTC time. 
2. **Testing Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true across different requests. 
3. **Distinct Examples**: The presence of 23 distinct examples, all conforming to the 20-character length, further supports the validity of the invariant. 
4. **Specification Compliance**: The specification does not contradict the invariant, as it does not mention any other formats or lengths for the `recordingDate`. 

### Conclusion
Given the consistent format of the `recordingDate` across multiple examples and the lack of counterexamples in extensive testing, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. The invariant correctly reflects the expected behavior of the API response regarding the length of the `recordingDate` string.

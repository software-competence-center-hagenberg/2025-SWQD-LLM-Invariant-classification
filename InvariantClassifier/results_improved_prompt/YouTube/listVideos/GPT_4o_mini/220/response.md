### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of videos from the YouTube API, with a query parameter `maxWidth` that is an integer between 72 and 8192. The response includes a `pageInfo` object that contains `resultsPerPage`, which indicates the number of results returned in a single page.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxWidth > return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage`, meaning that the maximum width specified in the request should always be greater than the number of results returned in the response.

### Analysis
- The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found, which strongly suggests that the invariant holds for the tested cases.
- The invariant is based on the relationship between the request parameter `maxWidth` and the response field `resultsPerPage`. However, the Swagger definition does not provide a direct relationship between these two fields. The `maxWidth` parameter is intended for controlling the player size, while `resultsPerPage` is about pagination of the results.
- The values provided in the examples show that `maxWidth` can be significantly larger than `resultsPerPage`, but there is no explicit requirement in the API specification that enforces this relationship. It is possible that in some scenarios, `resultsPerPage` could be equal to or greater than `maxWidth`, especially if the API implementation changes or if the filtering criteria lead to a different response.

### Conclusion
While the invariant holds for the tested cases, the lack of a direct relationship in the API specification and the potential for future changes in the API behavior suggest that this invariant may not be universally true. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**. 

Confidence in this classification is moderate due to the lack of counterexamples but also the uncertainty in the relationship between the two variables.

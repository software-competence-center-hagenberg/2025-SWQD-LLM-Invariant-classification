### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the response from the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` includes a property `kind`, which is described as a fixed string with the value "youtube#videoListResponse". This suggests that the `kind` property should always return this specific string value.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `return.kind` is always equal to 13. This is based on the assumption that the `kind` value is a fixed string of length 13.

### Analysis
1. **Fixed String Value**: The Swagger definition explicitly states that the `kind` value is "youtube#videoListResponse", which indeed has a length of 13 characters.
2. **Testing Results**: The testing results show that there have been 10,000 calls made without finding a counterexample, and 129,895 examples of the `kind` value were found, all consistent with the fixed string. This strongly supports the invariant.
3. **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant is semantically consistent with the definition provided in the Swagger documentation. Since the `kind` value is fixed and does not vary, the length of the string will always be 13.

### Conclusion
Given the explicit definition in the Swagger documentation and the extensive testing results that support the invariant, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. The invariant holds true for every valid request on the API as per the provided information.

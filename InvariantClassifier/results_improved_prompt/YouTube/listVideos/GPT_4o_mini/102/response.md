### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response includes a property `items`, which is an array of video objects. Each video object contains `contentDetails`, which has a deprecated property `regionRestriction`. This property includes an `allowed` array that lists country codes where the video is viewable. Additionally, each video object has a `player` property, which contains `embedHeight` among other properties.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.player.embedHeight` is always a member of the array `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]`. This means that the value of `embedHeight` must be one of the country codes listed in the `allowed` array.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Context**: The `embedHeight` property is related to the video player and represents a height value for embedding the video. In contrast, the `allowed` array contains country codes, which are strings representing geographical locations. There is no semantic relationship between a height value (which is likely a numeric string) and country codes. Therefore, it does not make sense for a height value to be a member of a list of country codes.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The Swagger definition does not indicate any relationship between `embedHeight` and the `allowed` array. The properties serve different purposes and are not intended to be compared or related.

3. **Testing Results**: Although 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the lack of counterexamples does not validate the invariant due to the semantic mismatch. The invariant is fundamentally flawed because it compares unrelated types of data.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic mismatch and the lack of logical connection between `embedHeight` and `allowed`, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear distinction between the types of data being compared.

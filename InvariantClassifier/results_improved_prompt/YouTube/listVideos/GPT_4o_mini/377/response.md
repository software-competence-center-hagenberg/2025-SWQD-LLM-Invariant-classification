### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. Each video resource has a `status` object containing two boolean properties: `embeddable` and `selfDeclaredMadeForKids`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.status.embeddable == return.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids`, meaning that the values of these two boolean properties are always equal in the API response.

### Analysis
- The invariant suggests a strict equality between two properties that are conceptually different: `embeddable` indicates whether a video can be embedded on another website, while `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` indicates whether the video is marked as made for kids by its creator. 
- These two properties serve different purposes and are not inherently related, which raises suspicion about the validity of the invariant.
- The fact that there are 1000 calls without a counterexample is notable, but it does not guarantee that the invariant holds universally, especially given the semantic difference between the two properties.
- The presence of 4 examples, with only 1 being distinct, suggests limited data supporting the invariant. The lack of counterexamples could be coincidental rather than indicative of a true relationship between the two properties.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic difference between `embeddable` and `selfDeclaredMadeForKids`, and the fact that the invariant imposes a relationship that is not supported by the definitions of these properties, it is likely a false-positive. The invariant does not hold universally for all valid requests to the API. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with a confidence of 0.85.

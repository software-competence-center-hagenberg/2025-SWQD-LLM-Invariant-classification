### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that retrieves a list of YouTube videos, including details about their content. The specific property of interest is `regionRestriction.allowed`, which is an array of strings representing country codes where the video is viewable. The description indicates that if this property is present and contains an empty list, the video is blocked in all countries. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `allowed` array can only be one of the values in the set {9, 80, 94}. 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the number of allowed regions for a video is restricted to only three specific sizes: 9, 80, or 94. 
2. **Data Collected**: The analysis indicates that in 100 calls, no counterexamples were found, and 4 examples were collected with 3 distinct sizes. One example provided has a size of 9. 
3. **Consideration of Other Values**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly limit the size of the `allowed` array to these values. The array can theoretically contain any number of country codes, and the invariant does not account for the possibility of other sizes that might be valid according to the API's design. 
4. **Semantic Context**: The invariant restricts the size of an array based on a few observed examples, but it is not semantically justified by the API specification. The specification allows for flexibility in the number of allowed regions, which could exceed the specified sizes. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the size of the `allowed` array to specific values without clear justification from the API specification, and considering that the API could potentially return other sizes, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is moderate due to the lack of counterexamples but high uncertainty regarding the potential for other valid sizes.

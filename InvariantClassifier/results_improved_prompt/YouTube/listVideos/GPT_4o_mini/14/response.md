### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the `caption` property of `contentDetails` is a string that can only take on the values `true` or `false`, as specified by the `enum` constraint. This means that the API is designed to return only these two specific string values for the `caption` field.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.contentDetails.caption` can only be one of the values in the set {"false", "true"}. This aligns perfectly with the `enum` definition in the Swagger documentation.

### Analysis
Given that the Swagger definition explicitly restricts the `caption` property to the values `true` and `false`, the invariant is supported by the API's specification. Additionally, the fact that there were 10,000 calls made without finding a counterexample further strengthens the case for this invariant being a true-positive. The presence of 28,274 examples with only two distinct values ("true" and "false") reinforces the idea that the invariant holds true across the tested scenarios.

### Conclusion
Based on the explicit constraints in the Swagger definition and the extensive testing that supports the invariant, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is very high due to the clear alignment with the API specification and the lack of counterexamples in extensive testing.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies that the `maxResults` parameter is an integer that must be at least 1 and can have a maximum length of 50. However, it does not explicitly define an upper limit for the `thumbnails.high.width` property in the response, which is an integer representing the width of a thumbnail image.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxResults < return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width`. This means that for every valid request, the value of `maxResults` must be less than the width of the thumbnail returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **No Counterexamples Found**: The fact that no counterexamples were found after 10,000 calls suggests a strong correlation between the `maxResults` and the `thumbnails.high.width` values observed in the responses. 
2. **Distinct Examples**: The presence of 842 examples, with 50 distinct values, indicates a reasonable variety in the data, but it does not guarantee that the invariant will hold in all cases, especially since the API could return different thumbnail widths for different videos.
3. **Specification Limitations**: The Swagger definition does not provide a maximum value for `thumbnails.high.width`, which means it could theoretically be any positive integer. If there exists a scenario where `thumbnails.high.width` is less than or equal to `maxResults`, the invariant would not hold.
4. **Semantic Relevance**: The invariant compares two variables that are semantically related (a request parameter and a response property), which adds to the likelihood of the invariant being valid.

### Conclusion
While the invariant has not been contradicted by the data collected, the lack of explicit constraints on the `thumbnails.high.width` property means that it is possible for this width to be less than or equal to `maxResults` in some cases. Therefore, the invariant cannot be classified as a true-positive with absolute certainty. Given these considerations, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with a confidence of **0.75**.

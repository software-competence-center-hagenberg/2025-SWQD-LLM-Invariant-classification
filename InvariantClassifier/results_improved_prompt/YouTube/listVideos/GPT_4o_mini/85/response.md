### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies a `maxWidth` parameter that is an integer with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192. The response includes a `thumbnails.default.height` property, which is an integer representing the height of a thumbnail image.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxWidth > return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height`, meaning that the maximum width specified in the request must always be greater than the height of the thumbnail returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Request Parameter (`maxWidth`)**: The `maxWidth` parameter can take on a wide range of values, starting from 72 up to 8192. 
2. **Response Property (`thumbnails.default.height`)**: The height of the thumbnail is not explicitly bounded in the Swagger definition, but it is reasonable to assume that thumbnail heights are typically much smaller than the maximum width specified. However, there is no explicit upper limit defined for the thumbnail height in the API documentation.
3. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 12 examples were found supporting the invariant, with 7 distinct examples showing that `maxWidth` was consistently greater than `thumbnails.default.height` in those cases.
4. **Potential for Violation**: While the current examples support the invariant, the lack of an upper limit on `thumbnails.default.height` means that it is theoretically possible for a thumbnail height to exceed the maximum width specified in the request. For instance, if a thumbnail were to be created with a height greater than 8192, it would violate the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of explicit constraints on the height of the thumbnails and the potential for the height to exceed the maximum width, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for all valid requests. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that retrieves a list of video resources from YouTube. The `part` parameter is required and specifies which properties of the video resource should be included in the response. The response includes a `pageInfo` object that contains `resultsPerPage`, which indicates the number of results returned in a single API call.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the number of results returned in the response (`return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage`) is not equal to the size of the `part` parameter minus one (`size(input.part[]) - 1`). This is represented as `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage != size(input.part[]) - 1`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests a relationship between the number of properties requested via the `part` parameter and the number of results returned. Specifically, it implies that if you request `n` properties, the results returned should not equal `n - 1`.
2. **API Behavior**: The API documentation does not explicitly state that the number of results returned is directly tied to the number of properties requested. The `resultsPerPage` indicates how many resources are returned, but it does not imply a direct correlation with the number of properties specified in the `part` parameter.
3. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 50 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant is universally true, especially since the API's behavior is not strictly defined in relation to the `part` parameter.
4. **Distinct Examples**: The 45 distinct examples provided show a variety of `part` values and corresponding `resultsPerPage` values. However, without a clear relationship established in the API documentation, it is difficult to conclude that the invariant holds true for all possible inputs.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of explicit correlation between the `part` parameter and the `resultsPerPage` in the API documentation, and the fact that the invariant is based on a relationship that is not guaranteed by the API's design, it is likely that this invariant is a false-positive. The invariant may hold for the tested cases, but it cannot be assumed to hold for all valid requests to the API. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with a confidence of **0.8** due to the lack of explicit contradictions in the specification but recognizing the potential for exceptions in untested cases.

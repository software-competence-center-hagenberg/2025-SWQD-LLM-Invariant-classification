### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of resources. The response schema indicates that the response includes a `pageInfo` object, which contains a property `resultsPerPage`. This property is defined as an integer that represents the number of results included in the API response.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 1`. This means that the API is expected to return at least one result per page.

### Analysis
- The invariant is based on the understanding that `resultsPerPage` should logically be at least 1, as returning 0 results per page would not make sense in the context of pagination. 
- The fact that there have been 100 calls made without finding a counterexample strongly supports the validity of the invariant. 
- Additionally, the presence of 150 examples in the request data, with 35 distinct examples, indicates a reasonable level of testing and variety in the requests, further supporting the invariant.
- The example values provided (50, 49, 27, 41, 42) all satisfy the invariant, reinforcing the idea that the API is designed to return a positive number of results per page.

### Conclusion
Given the logical reasoning behind the invariant, the absence of counterexamples in the testing, and the nature of the `resultsPerPage` property, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of the API, and the evidence supports its correctness.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies that the `definition` property of `contentDetails` can only take on two values: `sd` and `hd`. Both of these values are strings with a length of 2 characters.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of `return.contentDetails.definition` is always 2, which means that every valid response for this field should be a string of exactly 2 characters.

### Analysis
Given that the only possible values for `definition` are `sd` and `hd`, both of which have a length of 2, the invariant holds true for all valid responses. The fact that there were 10,000 calls made without finding a counterexample further supports the validity of this invariant. Additionally, the specification does not contradict this invariant, as it explicitly defines the possible values for `definition`.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a true-positive because it accurately reflects the constraints imposed by the API's specification, and there is strong empirical evidence supporting its validity.

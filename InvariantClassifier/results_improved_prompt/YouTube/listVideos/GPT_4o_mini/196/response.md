### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that retrieves a list of YouTube videos, including their content details and snippets. The `contentDetails` object contains a `regionRestriction` property, which has a `blocked` array indicating countries where the video is restricted. The `snippet` object contains a `tags` array, which holds keyword tags associated with the video.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `blocked` array (number of countries where the video is blocked) is less than the size of the `tags` array minus one. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

`size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked) < size(return.snippet.tags) - 1`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `blocked` array represents countries where the video is not available, while the `tags` array represents keywords associated with the video. There is no inherent relationship between the number of blocked countries and the number of tags, as they serve different purposes.
2. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 100 calls and no counterexamples were found, which suggests that it may hold true for the tested cases. However, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that it will hold for all possible cases, especially since the relationship between the two arrays is not defined by the API specification.
3. **Specification Considerations**: The API does not specify any constraints or relationships between the `blocked` countries and the `tags`. Therefore, it is possible to have scenarios where the number of blocked countries could equal or exceed the number of tags minus one, especially if a video has many restrictions or very few tags.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant imposes a relationship between two unrelated variables (blocked countries and tags), and considering that the API specification does not support such a relationship, the invariant is likely a false-positive. The fact that it has not been disproven in the tested calls does not provide sufficient evidence to classify it as a true-positive. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `pageInfo` object that contains paging details for the resources returned.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.pageInfo != null`, meaning that the `pageInfo` object in the response should never be null.

### Analysis
Given that the invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, it strongly suggests that the API consistently returns a `pageInfo` object in its responses. The Swagger definition does not indicate any conditions under which `pageInfo` could be null, and since it is a standard practice in API design to provide pagination information when returning lists of resources, it is reasonable to conclude that `pageInfo` should always be present.

### Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, along with the lack of specification indicating that `pageInfo` could be null, the invariant `return.pageInfo != null` is classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the significant number of calls made without finding any violations of the invariant.

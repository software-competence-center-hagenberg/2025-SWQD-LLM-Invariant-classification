### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an array of items, each with a `player` object and a `status` object. The `player` object includes an `embedHtml` string, while the `status` object includes a `license` string that can take on values from a defined enum: `youtube` or `creativeCommon`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.status.license` is a substring of `return.player.embedHtml`. This means that the value of the `license` field should appear somewhere within the `embedHtml` string.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Context**: The `license` field describes the type of license for the video, while the `embedHtml` field contains HTML code for embedding a video player. There is no inherent semantic relationship between the license type and the HTML code for embedding a video. It is unlikely that the license type would be included as a substring within the HTML embed code, as they serve different purposes.

2. **Counterexamples**: Although no counterexamples were found in the 100 calls made, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant holds universally. The fact that the invariant is based on a substring relationship between two unrelated fields raises concerns about its validity.

3. **Distinct Examples**: The presence of 73 examples, with 66 distinct examples, suggests that there may be some correlation in the data observed, but this does not confirm that the invariant is universally true. The examples may simply reflect a coincidence rather than a rule.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic disconnect between the `license` and `embedHtml` fields, and the nature of the invariant suggesting a substring relationship where none is logically expected, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the reasoning based on the API's design and the lack of a meaningful relationship between the two fields.

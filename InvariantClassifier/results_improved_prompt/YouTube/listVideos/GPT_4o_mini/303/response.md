### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource contains a `contentDetails` object with two boolean properties: `hasCustomThumbnail` and `licensedContent`. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.contentDetails.hasCustomThumbnail == return.contentDetails.licensedContent`, which implies that the values of these two properties are always equal for any video resource returned by this API. 

### Analysis
1. **Boolean Properties**: Both `hasCustomThumbnail` and `licensedContent` are boolean values. The invariant suggests that these two properties will always have the same value (either both true or both false). 
2. **API Behavior**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests a strong correlation between these two properties in the responses received. However, the fact that there is only one distinct example among the 61 examples found raises some concerns about the generality of the invariant. 
3. **Specification Considerations**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that these two properties must be equal or that they are related in any way. Therefore, while the testing results are promising, the lack of explicit specification support means that there could be edge cases or scenarios not covered by the tests. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant suggests a strict equality between two properties that are not explicitly defined to be related in the API specification, and considering the limited diversity in the examples, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is moderate due to the strong testing results but tempered by the lack of specification support and the potential for untested scenarios.

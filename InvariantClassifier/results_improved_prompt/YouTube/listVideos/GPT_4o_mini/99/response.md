### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that retrieves a list of YouTube videos, including their content details and live streaming details. The relevant properties are:
- `contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed`: An array of region codes where the video is viewable.
- `liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime`: A string representing the time that the broadcast actually ended.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]`. This implies that the actual end time of a live stream is somehow related to the allowed regions for viewing the video.

### Analysis
1. **Semantics**: The `actualEndTime` represents a timestamp, while `allowed` is an array of region codes (strings). Comparing a timestamp to a list of region codes does not make semantic sense. A timestamp cannot be a member of a list of strings that represent countries or regions.
2. **Specification**: The specification does not suggest any relationship between the end time of a live stream and the regions where the video can be viewed. The two properties serve different purposes and are not logically connected.
3. **Testing**: Although 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the nature of the invariant suggests that it is fundamentally flawed due to the semantic mismatch. Just because no counterexamples were found does not validate the invariant, especially when the comparison is between unrelated types.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic mismatch between the types being compared in the invariant, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant does not hold true for every valid request on the API, as it incorrectly assumes a relationship that does not exist. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

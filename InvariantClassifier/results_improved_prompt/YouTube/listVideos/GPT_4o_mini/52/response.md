### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource can have a `contentDetails` object, which includes a `regionRestriction` property. This property contains an `allowed` array that lists the region codes where the video is viewable. The description specifies that if the `allowed` property is present and contains an empty list, the video is blocked in all countries.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `allowed` array in the `regionRestriction` object must be one of the values in the set {80, 94}. This means that the `allowed` array can only have 80 or 94 elements.

### Analysis
1. **Context of the Invariant**: The `allowed` array is meant to specify the countries where the video can be viewed. The number of countries can vary significantly based on the video's licensing and distribution rights. It is not reasonable to assume that the number of countries (or region codes) would be limited to just 80 or 94, as this could vary widely depending on the content.
2. **Testing and Examples**: While the testing has not found any counterexamples in 50 calls, this does not provide strong evidence that the invariant is universally true. The fact that only 2 examples were found, both distinct, does not sufficiently support the claim that the size of the `allowed` array can only be 80 or 94. The limited number of calls and examples suggests that the invariant may not hold under broader conditions.
3. **Specification Contradiction**: The specification does not explicitly restrict the size of the `allowed` array to 80 or 94. Given that the number of countries can vary, it is likely that there are cases where the size of the `allowed` array could be less than 80 or greater than 94, making the invariant incorrect.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant that the size of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]` is one of {80, 94} is likely a false-positive. The reasoning is that the size of the `allowed` array is not inherently limited to these values based on the API's purpose and the nature of the data it handles. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

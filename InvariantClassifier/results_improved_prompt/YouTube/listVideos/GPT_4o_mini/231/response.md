### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a response from the YouTube API that includes a property `regionRestriction` within `contentDetails`. The `allowed` property is an array of strings representing region codes where the video is viewable. The description states that if `allowed` is present and contains an empty list, the video is blocked in all countries.

### Invariant
The invariant states that all elements of the array `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]` have a length of 2. This means that every string in the `allowed` array must consist of exactly two characters.

### Analysis
1. **Length of Region Codes**: The region codes used in the YouTube API are typically ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes, which are indeed two-letter country codes (e.g., 'US' for the United States, 'FR' for France). This aligns with the invariant that all elements have a length of 2.
2. **Testing Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which strongly suggests that this invariant holds true for the current implementation of the API.
3. **Distinct Examples**: The presence of 738 examples, with 48 distinct values, further supports the likelihood that the invariant is valid, as it shows a variety of valid responses that conform to the invariant.
4. **Specification Support**: The Swagger definition does not contradict the invariant; instead, it supports it by indicating that the `allowed` array contains region codes that are expected to be two-letter strings.

### Conclusion
Given the strong evidence from testing, the nature of the data being returned, and the alignment with the Swagger definition, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. The invariant is likely to hold for every valid request on the API.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            etag:
              type: string
              description: Etag of this resource.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.etag)==27

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 8242 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.etag=uS5DROk3ZuhgALERXczGAmt3qX8
output.etag=rLA8O2vnpkYIlDN3Vl7M6R7hL5g
output.etag=eanTwttwrRsBoRwemxg35cabUvg

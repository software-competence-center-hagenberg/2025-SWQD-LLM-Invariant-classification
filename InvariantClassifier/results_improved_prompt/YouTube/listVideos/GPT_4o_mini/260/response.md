### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the `viewCount` is a property of the `statistics` object, which is part of the response schema for the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint. The `viewCount` is defined as a string that represents the number of times a video has been viewed.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.statistics.viewCount is Numeric`, which means that the `viewCount` string should only contain numeric characters.

### Analysis
1. **Data Type**: The Swagger definition specifies that `viewCount` is of type `string`. However, it is expected to represent a numeric value (the count of views).
2. **Examples**: The provided examples of `viewCount` (e.g., `58632`, `22984214`, etc.) are all numeric strings. The fact that 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample strongly supports the idea that this invariant holds true for the current implementation of the API.
3. **Specification Compliance**: The invariant does not contradict the Swagger definition, as it is reasonable to expect that a string representing a numeric value would only contain numeric characters.
4. **Generalization**: While the invariant has been validated against a large number of calls and examples, it is important to note that the API could theoretically return non-numeric strings in the future, especially if the specification were to change or if there were errors in the data.

### Conclusion
Given the strong evidence from the number of calls and examples, along with the alignment of the invariant with the Swagger definition, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. However, there is always a slight risk that future changes could introduce non-numeric values, but based on the current data, the confidence is high.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that retrieves a list of video resources from YouTube, including their basic details such as `categoryId`. The `categoryId` is defined as a string in the schema, which indicates that it can contain characters other than just numeric digits.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.snippet.categoryId` is Numeric, which implies that the `categoryId` should only consist of numeric characters (0-9).

### Analysis
1. **Type of `categoryId`:** According to the Swagger definition, `categoryId` is defined as a string. This means that while it can contain numeric characters, it is not restricted to them. Strings can include letters, symbols, or other characters, which contradicts the invariant.
2. **Examples Provided:** The examples provided (1, 2, 20, 10, 22) are all numeric, but the fact that they are numeric does not guarantee that all possible values of `categoryId` are numeric. The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, but this does not account for the possibility of non-numeric values existing in the broader dataset.
3. **Specification Contradiction:** The specification does not explicitly restrict `categoryId` to numeric values. Therefore, it is possible that other values (e.g., alphanumeric strings or special characters) could be valid responses.

### Conclusion
Given that `categoryId` is defined as a string and not explicitly restricted to numeric values, the invariant that it is always numeric is incorrect. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a false-positive. 

Confidence in this classification is high due to the clear definition in the Swagger documentation.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The `id` parameter is an optional query parameter that can take an array of video IDs. The response includes a `pageInfo` object that contains `resultsPerPage`, which indicates the number of results returned in the API response.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the number of results returned (`return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage`) is equal to the size of the input array of IDs (`size(input.id[])`). This means that the number of results returned should directly correspond to the number of IDs provided in the request.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that every time an array of IDs is provided, the API will return a number of results equal to the number of IDs. This would imply that the API does not filter or limit the results based on the IDs provided.
2. **API Behavior**: The API may have internal logic that determines how many results to return based on the IDs provided. For example, if an ID does not correspond to a valid video, it may not be included in the results, leading to a situation where `resultsPerPage` is less than `size(input.id[])`. 
3. **Counterexamples**: While no counterexamples were found in the 100 calls made, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant holds universally. The API could have specific conditions or edge cases that were not tested. 
4. **Distinct Examples**: The 28 examples with 19 distinct cases suggest some consistency, but they do not conclusively prove that the invariant holds for all possible inputs. 
5. **Specification Considerations**: The specification does not explicitly state that the number of results will always equal the number of IDs provided. Therefore, it is possible for the API to return fewer results than the number of IDs due to filtering or other internal logic.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes a strict equality between the number of IDs and the number of results returned, and considering that the API may not guarantee this behavior based on its internal logic, the invariant is likely a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is moderate due to the lack of counterexamples but is based on the understanding of typical API behavior and the potential for filtering results.

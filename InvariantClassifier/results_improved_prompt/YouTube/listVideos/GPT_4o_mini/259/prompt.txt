Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                statistics:
                  type: object
                  description: Statistics about the video, such as the number of times the video was viewed or liked.
                  properties:
                    likeCount:
                      type: string
                      description: The number of users who have indicated that they liked the video by giving it a positive rating.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.statistics.likeCount is Numeric

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsNumeric
Invariant description: Indicates that the characters of a string variable are always numeric. Represented as x is Numeric.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 25729 examples in the requests data, with 12275 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.items.statistics.likeCount=17541
output.items.statistics.likeCount=18874
output.items.statistics.likeCount=252134
output.items.statistics.likeCount=682931
output.items.statistics.likeCount=795611

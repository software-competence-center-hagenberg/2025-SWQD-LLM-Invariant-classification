### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an `items` array, where each item has a `fileDetails` object that describes the properties of the video file.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.fileDetails == null`, which implies that for every item in the response, the `fileDetails` property is expected to be null.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The Swagger definition indicates that `fileDetails` is part of the response structure for each item in the `items` array. This suggests that `fileDetails` should contain information about the video file properties.
2. **Semantic Meaning**: The description of `fileDetails` indicates that it contains important metadata about the video, such as technical details and content length. If `fileDetails` were always null, it would imply that no metadata is available, which contradicts the purpose of the API.
3. **Testing Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample. While this suggests that the invariant holds in the tested cases, it does not guarantee that it is universally true, especially if the API is designed to return valid `fileDetails` under certain conditions.
4. **Specification Consideration**: The specification does not explicitly state that `fileDetails` can only be null. In fact, it describes `fileDetails` as containing various properties, which implies that it should have valid values in many cases.

### Conclusion
Given the structure of the response and the semantic meaning of `fileDetails`, the invariant `return.fileDetails == null` is likely a false-positive. The API is designed to provide metadata about video files, and while it may return null in some cases, it is not correct to assert that it will always be null. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with high confidence.

Verdict: false-positive
Confidence: 0.95

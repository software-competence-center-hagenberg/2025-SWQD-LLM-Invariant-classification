Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
      - name: maxResults
        in: query
        description: The *maxResults* parameter specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the result set. *Note:* This parameter is supported for use in conjunction with the myRating and chart parameters, but it is not supported for use in conjunction with the id parameter.
        required: false
        type: integer
        minimum: 1
        maxLength: 50
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            pageInfo:
              type: object
              description: Paging details for lists of resources, including total number of items available and number of resources returned in a single page.
              properties:
                totalResults:
                  type: integer
                  description: The total number of results in the result set.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.maxResults != return.pageInfo.totalResults

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two long scalars. Prints as x != y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 1000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 556 examples in the requests data, with 168 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.maxResults=18; output.pageInfo.totalResults=39
input.maxResults=33; output.pageInfo.totalResults=200
input.maxResults=22; output.pageInfo.totalResults=168
input.maxResults=26; output.pageInfo.totalResults=42
input.maxResults=25; output.pageInfo.totalResults=108

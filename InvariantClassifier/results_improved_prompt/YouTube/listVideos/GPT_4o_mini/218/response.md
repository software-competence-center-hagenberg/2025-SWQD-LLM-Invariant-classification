### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies that the `maxResults` parameter is an integer that indicates the maximum number of items to be returned in the result set. It has a minimum value of 1 and a maximum length of 50. The `totalResults` field in the response indicates the total number of results available, which can be greater than or equal to `maxResults` but is not limited to it.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxResults != return.pageInfo.totalResults`, meaning that the maximum number of results requested should not equal the total number of results available.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `maxResults` parameter specifies how many items the client wants to receive, while `totalResults` indicates how many items are available in total. It is possible for `totalResults` to be greater than `maxResults`, equal to `maxResults`, or even less than `maxResults` if there are fewer items available than requested.
2. **Counterexamples**: The invariant claims that `maxResults` cannot equal `totalResults`. However, it is entirely possible for a request to specify a `maxResults` value that matches the total number of results available. For example, if there are exactly 39 items available and the client requests 39, then `maxResults` would equal `totalResults`. This scenario contradicts the invariant.
3. **Empirical Evidence**: Although there were no counterexamples found in the 1000 calls, the nature of the invariant suggests that it is not universally applicable. The fact that there are valid scenarios where `maxResults` can equal `totalResults` indicates that the invariant does not hold in all cases.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant `input.maxResults != return.pageInfo.totalResults` is a **false-positive** because it does not account for the possibility that the maximum number of results requested can equal the total number of results available. Therefore, I am confident in classifying this invariant as a false-positive.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                liveStreamingDetails:
                  type: object
                  description: Details about the live streaming metadata.
                  properties:
                    concurrentViewers:
                      type: string
                      description: The number of viewers currently watching the broadcast. The property and its value will be present if the broadcast has current viewers and the broadcast owner has not hidden the viewcount for the video. Note that YouTube stops tracking the number of concurrent viewers for a broadcast when the broadcast ends. So, this property would not identify the number of viewers watching an archived video of a live broadcast that already ended.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.liveStreamingDetails.concurrentViewers is Numeric

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsNumeric
Invariant description: Indicates that the characters of a string variable are always numeric. Represented as x is Numeric.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 156 examples in the requests data, with 111 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.items.liveStreamingDetails.concurrentViewers=311
output.items.liveStreamingDetails.concurrentViewers=310
output.items.liveStreamingDetails.concurrentViewers=277
output.items.liveStreamingDetails.concurrentViewers=555
output.items.liveStreamingDetails.concurrentViewers=313

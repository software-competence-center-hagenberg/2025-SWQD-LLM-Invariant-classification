### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes the response from the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, specifically focusing on the `liveStreamingDetails` object, which includes the `concurrentViewers` property. This property is defined as a string that represents the number of viewers currently watching a live broadcast. The definition states that this property will be present if there are current viewers and the broadcast owner has not hidden the view count.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.concurrentViewers` is Numeric, indicating that the characters of this string variable are always numeric. This is represented as `x is Numeric`.

### Analysis
1. **Nature of the Property**: The `concurrentViewers` property is explicitly defined as a string in the Swagger definition. While it is expected to contain numeric values (like '311', '310', etc.), it is still a string type. Therefore, it can technically contain non-numeric characters, although in practice, it may not.

2. **Evidence from Calls**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 156 examples were collected, with all values being numeric strings. This suggests a strong correlation between the expected behavior and the observed data.

3. **Specification Consideration**: The specification does not explicitly state that the `concurrentViewers` string can contain non-numeric characters, which supports the idea that it is always numeric in practice.

### Conclusion
Given the strong evidence from the testing and the alignment with the Swagger definition, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. However, it is essential to note that since the property is defined as a string, there is a theoretical possibility of it containing non-numeric characters, but this has not been observed in the data collected. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive** with high confidence.

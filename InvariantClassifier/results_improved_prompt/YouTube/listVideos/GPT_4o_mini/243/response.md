### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the `embedWidth` property is a string type, which is used to represent the width of the video player in an embedded format. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.player.embedWidth` is Numeric, which implies that the string representation of `embedWidth` consists solely of numeric characters. 

### Analysis
1. **Type Mismatch**: The Swagger definition specifies that `embedWidth` is of type `string`. However, the invariant suggests that it should always be numeric. While it is possible for a string to contain only numeric characters, the definition does not enforce this restriction. 

2. **Counterexamples**: Although 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the invariant's correctness is contingent upon the API's specification. If the API allows for non-numeric strings in the future or if there are edge cases not covered by the current examples, the invariant could be violated. 

3. **Semantic Consideration**: The `embedWidth` being a string type suggests that it may also include units or other non-numeric characters in different contexts, which would contradict the invariant. 

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition explicitly states that `embedWidth` is a string and does not restrict it to numeric values, the invariant that `return.player.embedWidth` is Numeric is a false-positive. There is a possibility that the API could return non-numeric strings in the future or in different contexts, which would invalidate the invariant. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a false-positive with high confidence.

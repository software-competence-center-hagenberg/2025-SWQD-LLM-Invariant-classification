Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                player:
                  type: object
                  description: Player to be used for a video playback.
                  properties:
                    embedWidth:
                      type: string
                      description: The embed width


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.player.embedWidth is Numeric

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsNumeric
Invariant description: Indicates that the characters of a string variable are always numeric. Represented as x is Numeric.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 21277 examples in the requests data, with 2747 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.items.player.embedWidth=3450
output.items.player.embedWidth=3451
output.items.player.embedWidth=4300
output.items.player.embedWidth=7811
output.items.player.embedWidth=4301

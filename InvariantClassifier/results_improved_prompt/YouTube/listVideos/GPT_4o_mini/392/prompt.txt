Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                statistics:
                  type: object
                  description: Statistics about the video, such as the number of times the video was viewed or liked.
                  properties:
                    dislikeCount:
                      type: string
                      description: The number of users who have indicated that they disliked the video by giving it a negative rating.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.statistics.dislikeCount is Numeric

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsNumeric
Invariant description: Indicates that the characters of a string variable are always numeric. Represented as x is Numeric.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 41 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:
output.items.statistics.dislikeCount=0

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that retrieves a list of resources with paging details. The relevant property for our invariant is `resultsPerPage`, which is defined as an integer representing the number of results included in the API response.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 0`, meaning that the number of results returned per page should always be non-negative.

### Analysis
1. **Specification Compliance**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `resultsPerPage` must be non-negative, but it is logical to assume that the number of results per page cannot be negative. A negative number of results per page would not make sense in the context of paging through a list of resources.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This strong empirical evidence supports the claim that `resultsPerPage` is always non-negative.
3. **Distinct Examples**: The presence of 51 distinct examples, all of which are positive integers, further reinforces the likelihood that the invariant holds true across various scenarios.

### Conclusion
Given the logical reasoning based on the API's purpose and the strong empirical evidence supporting the invariant, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of the API and is supported by extensive testing.

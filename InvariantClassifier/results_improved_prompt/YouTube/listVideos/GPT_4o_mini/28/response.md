### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition indicates that the `projectDetails` field is deprecated and has not been populated since its addition. The description explicitly states that this field was never populated and is retained only to avoid errors in client code that references it. 

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.projectDetails == null`, which suggests that the `projectDetails` field should always be null in the response. 

### Analysis
Given that the `projectDetails` field is deprecated and has never been populated, it is reasonable to conclude that it would consistently return null. The fact that there have been 10,000 calls without a counterexample further supports this conclusion. The invariant aligns with the information provided in the Swagger definition, which indicates that the field is not used and should not contain any meaningful data. 

### Conclusion
Based on the information from the Swagger definition and the extensive testing conducted, the invariant `return.projectDetails == null` is a true-positive. There is strong confidence in this classification due to the lack of counterexamples and the explicit nature of the field's deprecation.

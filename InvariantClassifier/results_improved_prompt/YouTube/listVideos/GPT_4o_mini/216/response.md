### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies that the `maxHeight` parameter is an optional integer with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192. The `totalResults` property in the response is also an integer that indicates the total number of results available.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxHeight > return.pageInfo.totalResults`, meaning that the value of `maxHeight` in the request should always be greater than the `totalResults` returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `maxHeight` parameter is used to filter the results, while `totalResults` indicates how many results match the criteria. It is possible for `totalResults` to be less than, equal to, or greater than `maxHeight` depending on the data available and the filtering applied.
2. **Counterexamples**: The invariant suggests that `maxHeight` must always be greater than `totalResults`. However, there are scenarios where this may not hold true. For instance, if there are fewer results than the specified `maxHeight`, `totalResults` could be less than `maxHeight`. This is evident from the example values provided, where `input.maxHeight` values are greater than `output.pageInfo.totalResults`, but this does not guarantee that it will always be the case.
3. **Statistical Evidence**: Although 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the fact that the invariant restricts the relationship between two variables that can vary independently suggests that it is not universally true. The lack of counterexamples in a limited number of calls does not sufficiently establish the invariant as a true-positive.

### Conclusion
Given the nature of the relationship between `maxHeight` and `totalResults`, and the potential for `totalResults` to be less than or equal to `maxHeight`, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, as there are valid scenarios where `totalResults` can be equal to or less than `maxHeight`. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

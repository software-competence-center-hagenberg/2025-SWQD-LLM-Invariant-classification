### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The `id` parameter is an optional query parameter that can take an array of video IDs. The response includes a `pageInfo` object that contains `resultsPerPage`, which indicates the number of results returned in the response.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the number of results per page (`return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage`) is greater than or equal to the size of the input IDs array minus one (`size(input.id[]) - 1`). This can be expressed as:

`return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= size(input.id[]) - 1`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant implies that if you request a certain number of video IDs, the API will return at least that many results minus one. This suggests that the API is expected to return a number of results that is at least one less than the number of IDs requested.

2. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 1000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This is a strong indication that the invariant holds true for the tested cases.

3. **Distinct Examples**: There are 366 examples of requests with 198 distinct input IDs. The examples provided show that for various inputs, the `resultsPerPage` returned is consistent with the invariant. For instance, when one ID is requested, the API returns one result, and when multiple IDs are requested, the results per page vary but still adhere to the invariant.

4. **Specification Consideration**: The swagger definition does not contradict the invariant. The `resultsPerPage` can logically be less than or equal to the number of IDs requested, especially if some IDs do not correspond to valid videos or if the API has a limit on the number of results returned.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of counterexamples and the consistent behavior observed in the examples, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. The invariant does not contradict the API's specification and aligns with the expected behavior of the API based on the provided examples.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies that the `maxResults` parameter is an integer that must be at least 1 and can have a maximum length of 50. The `regionRestriction.blocked` property is an array of strings that lists the countries where the video is blocked. If this property is present and contains an empty list, the video is viewable in all countries.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxResults > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`, meaning that the number of maximum results requested should be greater than the number of countries listed as blocked for the video.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `maxResults` parameter indicates how many items the user wants to retrieve, while `regionRestriction.blocked` indicates how many countries are blocking the video. The invariant suggests that the number of results requested should always exceed the number of blocked countries.
2. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 100 calls and no counterexamples were found, which suggests that it holds true for the tested cases. However, the invariant's validity is contingent on the relationship between the two variables.
3. **Potential Issues**: The invariant could be problematic if the `regionRestriction.blocked` array is empty, which would mean that the video is viewable in all countries. In such cases, the size of the array would be 0, and the invariant would hold true if `maxResults` is greater than 0. However, if the `maxResults` is set to 1, it would not be meaningful to say that it must be greater than the size of an empty array. Additionally, if the API allows for a `maxResults` value that is less than the number of blocked countries, it could lead to a situation where the invariant does not hold.

### Conclusion
While the invariant holds true for the tested cases, it does not account for all possible scenarios, particularly when the `regionRestriction.blocked` array is empty or when `maxResults` is set to a value less than the number of blocked countries. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** due to its potential failure in edge cases.

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

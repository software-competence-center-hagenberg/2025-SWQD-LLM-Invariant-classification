### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies that the `projection` property of `contentDetails` can take on two distinct values: `rectangular` and `360`. This means that the `projection` can be either of these two values when the API is called.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.contentDetails.projection == "rectangular"`. This implies that the only valid value for `projection` in the response is `rectangular`, which contradicts the definition that allows for `360` as a valid option as well.

### Analysis
- The invariant restricts the possible values of `projection` to only `rectangular`, while the Swagger definition explicitly states that `projection` can also be `360`.
- The fact that the invariant has been tested with 100 calls and found no counterexamples does not negate the fact that the specification allows for multiple valid values. The absence of counterexamples in a limited number of calls does not guarantee that the invariant is universally true.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant contradicts the specification by limiting the possible values of `projection` to only one option, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the explicit mention of multiple valid values in the Swagger definition.

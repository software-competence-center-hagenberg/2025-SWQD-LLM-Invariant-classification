Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                contentDetails:
                  type: object
                  description: Details about the content of a YouTube Video.
                  properties:
                    contentRating:
                      type: object
                      description: Ratings schemes. The country-specific ratings are mostly for movies and shows. LINT.IfChange
                      properties:
                        ytRating:
                          type: string
                          description: A rating that YouTube uses to identify age-restricted content.
                          enum: [ytUnspecified, ytAgeRestricted]


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.contentDetails.contentRating.ytRating)==15

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 27 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:
output.items.contentDetails.contentRating.ytRating=ytAgeRestricted

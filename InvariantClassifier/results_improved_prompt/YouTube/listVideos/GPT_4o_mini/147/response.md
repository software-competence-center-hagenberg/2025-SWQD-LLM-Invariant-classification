### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that retrieves video resources from YouTube. The `part` parameter is required and specifies which properties of the video resource to include in the response. The response contains an array of items, each with a `snippet` property that includes various details about the video, including thumbnails.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the width of the default thumbnail (`return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width`) is divisible by the number of parts specified in the `input.part` array (`input.part[]`). This is expressed mathematically as `return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width % size(input.part[]) == 0`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `input.part` parameter is a comma-separated list of properties requested in the API call. The `return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width` is an integer representing the width of the thumbnail image.
2. **Divisibility Logic**: The invariant suggests that the width of the thumbnail is somehow related to the number of properties requested. However, there is no indication in the Swagger definition that the width of the thumbnail is dependent on the number of properties requested. The width is likely a fixed value (e.g., 120) regardless of the `part` values.
3. **Counterexamples**: Although 50 calls did not yield any counterexamples, the invariant's logic does not hold up to scrutiny. The width of a thumbnail being divisible by the number of requested parts does not have a clear basis in the API's functionality or documentation. The invariant seems to impose an arbitrary mathematical relationship that is not supported by the API's design.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant appears to be a false-positive. It imposes a relationship between the width of a thumbnail and the number of requested properties that is not substantiated by the API's specification. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of videos from the YouTube API. The `maxHeight` parameter is an optional integer that specifies the maximum height of the videos to be retrieved, with a minimum value of 72. The response includes a `pageInfo` object that contains `totalResults`, which indicates the total number of results available.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter `maxHeight` should not equal the output value `totalResults` from the response. This is represented as `input.maxHeight != return.pageInfo.totalResults`.

### Analysis
1. **Parameter Context**: The `maxHeight` parameter is used to filter the results based on the height of the videos. It does not directly influence the total number of results returned, which is determined by the available videos that match the criteria.
2. **Response Context**: The `totalResults` indicates how many videos are available that meet the filtering criteria. It is possible for the total number of results to be any integer value, including values that could be equal to `maxHeight`, depending on the available videos.
3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 1000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant holds universally, especially since the `maxHeight` can theoretically match the `totalResults` if there are exactly that many videos of the specified height.
4. **Distinct Examples**: The presence of 593 distinct examples strengthens the argument for the invariant, but it does not eliminate the possibility of edge cases where `maxHeight` could equal `totalResults`.

### Conclusion
Given that the `maxHeight` parameter and `totalResults` are conceptually independent, and that the invariant does not account for the possibility of them being equal, it is likely a false-positive. The invariant restricts the relationship between two variables that can potentially take on the same value, which is not supported by the API's design. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** with a confidence of 0.85 due to the empirical evidence but acknowledging the theoretical possibility of equality.

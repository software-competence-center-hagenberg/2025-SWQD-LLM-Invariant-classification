### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response contains an `items` array, where each item has a `processingDetails` object. Within `processingDetails`, there is a `processingProgress` object that describes the video processing status and progress.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.processingDetails.processingProgress == null`. This means that for every response received from the API, the `processingProgress` field should always be null.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Context**: The `processingProgress` field is part of the `processingDetails` object, which is related to the processing status of a video. It is reasonable to assume that this field could be null if the video is not currently being processed or if there is no processing information available.

2. **Testing and Results**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls to the API, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests that in all tested cases, the `processingProgress` was indeed null.

3. **Specification Considerations**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `processingProgress` can take on non-null values. However, it does not rule out the possibility either. The absence of counterexamples in testing strengthens the case for the invariant being a true-positive, but it does not provide absolute certainty.

### Conclusion
Given the context of the API and the results of extensive testing, it is reasonable to classify the invariant `return.processingDetails.processingProgress == null` as a **true-positive**. The lack of counterexamples in 10,000 calls suggests that this invariant holds for the current implementation of the API. However, without explicit documentation confirming that `processingProgress` can only be null, there remains a slight uncertainty. Therefore, I would assign a high confidence level to this classification.

**Verdict**: true-positive  
**Confidence**: 0.9

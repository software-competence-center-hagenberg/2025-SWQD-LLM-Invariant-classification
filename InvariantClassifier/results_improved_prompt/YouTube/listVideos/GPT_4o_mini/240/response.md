### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the `scheduledStartTime` is a string representing the time that the broadcast is scheduled to begin. The expected format for such timestamps is typically ISO 8601, which is a standard format for date and time representation.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of `return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledStartTime` is always 20 characters. This suggests that every timestamp returned by the API will have exactly 20 characters.

### Analysis
Looking at the example values provided:
1. `2022-09-29T19:01:01Z` (20 characters)
2. `2022-10-05T22:00:00Z` (20 characters)
3. `2022-10-05T14:30:00Z` (20 characters)
4. `2022-09-29T23:30:00Z` (20 characters)
5. `2022-10-02T15:27:43Z` (20 characters)

All examples provided have a length of 20 characters, which aligns with the invariant. Additionally, the fact that 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample strengthens the argument for this invariant being a true-positive. 

However, it is important to consider the possibility of other formats or variations in the API response that might not have been captured in the testing. For example, if the API were to return a timestamp in a different format or if there were edge cases not covered by the examples, the invariant could potentially be violated. 

### Conclusion
Given the strong evidence from the examples and the lack of counterexamples in extensive testing, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. However, I remain cautious about the potential for untested edge cases that could arise in different scenarios or future changes to the API.

**Verdict**: true-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video has a `status` object containing a `privacyStatus` property. The `privacyStatus` can take one of three values: `public`, `unlisted`, or `private`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `privacyStatus` can only be one of two values: `public` or `unlisted`.

### Analysis
1. **Specification**: The Swagger definition explicitly states that `privacyStatus` can also be `private`. Therefore, the invariant is restricting the possible values of `privacyStatus` to only two options, which contradicts the specification.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: Although the invariant has been tested with 500 calls without finding a counterexample, the existence of the `private` status in the specification means that it is still a valid response that can occur, even if it hasn't been observed in the tested calls. The fact that only two distinct values have been found in the requests data does not negate the possibility of other values being valid according to the API specification.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the value of `privacyStatus` to only two options while the specification allows for a third option (`private`), this invariant is a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the explicit contradiction with the API specification.

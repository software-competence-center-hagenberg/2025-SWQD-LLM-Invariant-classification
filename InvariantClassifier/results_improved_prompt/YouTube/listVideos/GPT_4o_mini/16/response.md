### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the `definition` property of `contentDetails` can only take on two specific values: `sd` (standard definition) and `hd` (high definition). This is explicitly stated in the `enum` field of the Swagger definition.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.contentDetails.definition` can only be one of the values `"hd"` or `"sd"`. This is a direct reflection of the `enum` defined in the Swagger specification.

### Analysis
The invariant is supported by the Swagger definition, which restricts the possible values of `definition` to only `sd` and `hd`. The fact that 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample further supports the validity of the invariant. Additionally, the presence of 28,274 examples with only 2 distinct values (`hd` and `sd`) aligns perfectly with the invariant's claim. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant is directly supported by the Swagger definition and that extensive testing has shown no counterexamples, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is very high due to the clear constraints provided in the API specification and the extensive data supporting the invariant.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                liveStreamingDetails:
                  type: object
                  description: Details about the live streaming metadata.
                  properties:
                    scheduledEndTime:
                      type: string
                      description: The time that the broadcast is scheduled to end. If the value is empty or the property is not present, then the broadcast is scheduled to contiue indefinitely.
              items:
                snippet:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video, including title, description, uploader, thumbnails and category.
                  properties:
                    tags:
                      type: array
                      description: A list of keyword tags associated with the video. Tags may contain spaces.
                      items:
                        type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime in return.snippet.tags[]

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.sequenceString.MemberString
Invariant description: Represents String scalars that are always members of a sequence of String values. Prints as x in y[] where x is a String scalar and y[] is a sequence of String.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource can have `liveStreamingDetails` and `snippet` properties. The `liveStreamingDetails` includes a `scheduledEndTime`, which is a string representing when the broadcast is scheduled to end. The `snippet` includes a `tags` property, which is an array of strings representing keyword tags associated with the video.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime` is always a member of `return.snippet.tags[]`. This implies that the scheduled end time of a live stream is always included as a tag in the snippet of the video resource.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Relevance**: The `scheduledEndTime` is a specific timestamp related to the live stream, while `tags` are generally keywords or phrases that describe the content of the video. It is not semantically logical to expect a timestamp to be included in a list of tags, which are typically descriptive in nature.
2. **Specification Review**: The Swagger definition does not suggest that `scheduledEndTime` should be included in `tags`. In fact, it explicitly describes `tags` as a list of keywords, which would not logically include a timestamp.
3. **Testing Evidence**: Although 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the nature of the invariant suggests that it is unlikely to hold true in all cases due to the semantic mismatch between a timestamp and a list of tags.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic mismatch and the lack of specification support for the invariant, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant does not hold true for every valid request on the API, as it is unreasonable to expect a timestamp to be a member of a list of keyword tags. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.9

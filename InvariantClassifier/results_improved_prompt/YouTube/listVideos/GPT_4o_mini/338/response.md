### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema includes properties such as `contentDetails` and `liveStreamingDetails`, each containing specific metadata about the videos.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`. This means that the scheduled end time of a live stream is expected to be found within the list of blocked regions for the video.

### Analysis
1. **Semantics of Variables**: The `scheduledEndTime` represents a timestamp indicating when a live stream is scheduled to end, while `blocked` is an array of region codes (strings) that indicate countries where the video is blocked. Comparing a timestamp (string representing a date/time) to a list of region codes (strings representing country codes) does not make semantic sense. A timestamp cannot logically be a member of a list of country codes.

2. **Specification Contradiction**: The specification does not suggest any relationship between the scheduled end time of a live stream and the region restriction of a video. The two properties serve different purposes and are not inherently related.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: Although 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the lack of counterexamples does not validate the invariant due to the semantic mismatch. The invariant is fundamentally flawed because it compares unrelated data types.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic mismatch between the `scheduledEndTime` and the `blocked` array, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant does not hold true for every valid request on the API, as it is based on an incorrect assumption about the relationship between the two fields. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

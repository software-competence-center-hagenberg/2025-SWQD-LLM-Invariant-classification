### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies that the `projection` property of `contentDetails` can take on values defined in an enum: `rectangular` and `360`. This means that the API is designed to only allow these two specific values for the `projection` field.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.contentDetails.projection` can only be one of the values: `"360"` or `"rectangular"`. This is a direct reflection of the enum defined in the Swagger specification.

### Analysis
- The invariant aligns perfectly with the enum values specified in the Swagger definition. 
- The fact that there have been 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample strongly supports the validity of the invariant. 
- The presence of only two distinct values in the examples further reinforces that the invariant is likely correct, as it matches the defined enum.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant is consistent with the Swagger definition and has been validated by extensive testing without finding counterexamples, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. 

**Verdict:** true-positive
**Confidence:** 0.95

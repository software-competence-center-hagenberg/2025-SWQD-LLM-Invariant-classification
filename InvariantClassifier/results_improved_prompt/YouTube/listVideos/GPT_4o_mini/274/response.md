### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of video resources, which may include details about live streaming. The `liveStreamingDetails` object contains the `activeLiveChatId`, which is a string that represents the ID of the currently active live chat for live broadcasts. This field is only populated when the video is currently live.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `activeLiveChatId` will always equal a specific string value: "Cg0KC19xU2YwMWtaUDB3KicKGFVDTEZTYU5xazdNbmRLblJjWlYwUmlsURILX3FTZjAxa1pQMHc".

### Analysis
1. **Nature of the Field**: The `activeLiveChatId` is a string that is populated only for live broadcasts. If a video is not live, this field will not be present or will be null. 
2. **Distinct Values**: The invariant suggests that `activeLiveChatId` can only take on this one specific value. However, the specification does not restrict the `activeLiveChatId` to a single value; it only states that it will be filled for live broadcasts. This implies that there could be multiple valid `activeLiveChatId` values for different live broadcasts.
3. **Counter Examples**: Although there were no counter examples found in 100 calls, the lack of counter examples does not guarantee that the invariant is universally true. The API could return different `activeLiveChatId` values for different live broadcasts.
4. **Example Values**: The provided example value matches the invariant, but it is only one instance. The fact that there is only one example in the request data suggests that the invariant may not hold universally across different live broadcasts.

### Conclusion
Given that the `activeLiveChatId` can potentially take on multiple values depending on the live broadcast, and the invariant restricts it to a single value, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the reasoning provided about the nature of the field and the lack of explicit restrictions in the API documentation.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The `id` parameter is an optional array that can filter the results based on specific video IDs. The response includes an array of items, each containing `contentDetails`, which has a `regionRestriction` object. This object can include a `blocked` property, which is an array of region codes where the video is blocked.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the input `id` array must divide the size of the `blocked` array from the response without a remainder: `size(input.id[]) % size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) == 0`. This means that the number of video IDs requested should evenly divide the number of regions where the video is blocked.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `input.id` represents the number of video IDs requested, while `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked` represents the number of regions where the video is blocked. The invariant suggests a mathematical relationship between these two counts.
2. **Logical Consistency**: There is no inherent logical connection between the number of video IDs requested and the number of regions where a video is blocked. The blocked regions depend on the content of the video itself, which is independent of how many IDs are queried. For example, if a video is blocked in 3 regions, it does not imply that it must be requested in a multiple of 3 IDs.
3. **Counterexamples**: Although no counterexamples were found in 1000 calls, the lack of counterexamples does not imply that the invariant is universally true. The nature of the relationship between the two variables does not support the invariant's claim.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of a logical connection between the number of requested video IDs and the number of blocked regions, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, as the relationship it asserts is not supported by the API's design and functionality. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

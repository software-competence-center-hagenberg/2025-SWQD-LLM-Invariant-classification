### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that retrieves a list of videos from YouTube, including details about thumbnails and region restrictions. The relevant parts of the response schema indicate that each video has a `thumbnails` object with a `standard` property that includes a `width` integer. Additionally, the `contentDetails` object contains a `regionRestriction` property, which may include a `blocked` array listing countries where the video is restricted.

### Invariant
The invariant in question states that the width of the thumbnail (`return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width`) is greater than the size of the `blocked` array (`size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`). This means that for every response, the width of the thumbnail must be greater than the number of countries listed in the `blocked` array.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The width of the thumbnail is a fixed integer value (e.g., 640), while the `blocked` array can vary in size depending on the video's restrictions. The invariant suggests a relationship where the width must always exceed the number of blocked countries.
2. **Data Observations**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which strongly suggests that it holds true across the tested responses. The examples provided show that the width is consistently 640, while the `blocked` array varies in size.
3. **Logical Consideration**: The maximum size of the `blocked` array in the provided examples is 6 (as seen in the second example). Since 640 is significantly greater than 6, it appears that the invariant holds true in the tested cases. However, the invariant does not account for the possibility of the `blocked` array being empty, which would imply that the width must be greater than 0, which it is.
4. **Potential Edge Cases**: The invariant could potentially fail if there are cases where the `blocked` array has more entries than the width of the thumbnail. However, given the current data and the lack of counterexamples, it seems unlikely that the API would return a width less than the size of the `blocked` array.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant appears to be a true-positive. The extensive testing without counterexamples and the logical relationship between the variables support this classification. However, it is important to note that while the current data supports the invariant, future changes to the API or unexpected data could potentially invalidate it. Therefore, while I am confident in this classification, I would recommend continued monitoring of the API responses for any changes that could affect this invariant.

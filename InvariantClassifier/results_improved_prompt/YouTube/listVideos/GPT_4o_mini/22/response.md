### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that retrieves a list of video resources, including detailed metadata about video streams. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that the `videoStreams` property is an array of objects containing various properties related to video streams.

### Invariant
The invariant in question states that `return.fileDetails.videoStreams == null`. This suggests that the `videoStreams` property is expected to be null in all valid responses from the API.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Context**: The `videoStreams` property is described as an array that contains metadata about video streams. The presence of this property implies that it is expected to hold data about the video streams of the retrieved videos.
2. **Possible Values**: Given that the API is designed to retrieve video resources, it is reasonable to expect that for many videos, there will be associated video streams, which means that `videoStreams` would typically not be null. 
3. **Testing Results**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample. While this suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true, it does not account for all possible scenarios, especially since the API could return videos without streams under certain conditions (e.g., if the video is not encoded properly or if it is a placeholder).
4. **Specification Considerations**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `videoStreams` can be null, but it does not rule it out either. However, the nature of the API suggests that it is designed to return video data, which typically includes streams.

### Conclusion
Given the context of the API and the nature of the `videoStreams` property, it is highly likely that this invariant is a false-positive. The expectation that `videoStreams` is always null contradicts the typical behavior of a video retrieval API, which would usually return stream data for valid videos. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with high confidence due to the semantic expectations of the API's functionality.

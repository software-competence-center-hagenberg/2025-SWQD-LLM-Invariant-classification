### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` allows for a `GET` request to retrieve video resources, with a required query parameter `part` that specifies which properties of the video should be included in the response. The response includes a list of video items, each containing a `snippet` object, which has a `thumbnails` property that includes a `high` object with a `width` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the width of the high-resolution thumbnail (`return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width`) is divisible by the size of the input `part` array (`input.part[]`). This is expressed mathematically as `return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width % size(input.part[]) == 0`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `input.part` is an array that specifies which properties to include in the response. The `return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width` is an integer representing the width of a thumbnail image. 
2. **Divisibility Condition**: The invariant suggests that the width of the thumbnail should be divisible by the number of properties requested in the `part` parameter. 
3. **Empirical Evidence**: The testing has shown that in 50 calls, there were no counterexamples found, and there were 13 distinct examples where the invariant held true. However, the invariant's validity hinges on the relationship between the `part` parameter and the `width` of the thumbnail. 
4. **Semantic Relevance**: There is no inherent semantic relationship between the number of properties requested in `part` and the width of the thumbnail. The width of a thumbnail is a fixed property of the image and does not logically depend on how many properties are requested in the API call. This lack of a meaningful connection suggests that the invariant is likely incorrect.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant lacks a logical basis and there is no clear relationship between the `input.part` size and the `return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width`, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The empirical evidence does not provide sufficient justification to assert that this invariant will hold for all valid requests, especially considering the semantic disconnect. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

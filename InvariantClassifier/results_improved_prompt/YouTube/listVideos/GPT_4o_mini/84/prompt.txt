Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
      - name: maxResults
        in: query
        description: The *maxResults* parameter specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the result set. *Note:* This parameter is supported for use in conjunction with the myRating and chart parameters, but it is not supported for use in conjunction with the id parameter.
        required: false
        type: integer
        minimum: 1
        maxLength: 50
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                topicDetails:

                  properties:
                    topicCategories:
                      type: array
                      description: A list of Wikipedia URLs that provide a high-level description of the video's content.
                      items:
                        type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.maxResults > size(return.topicDetails.topicCategories[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 66 examples in the requests data, with 66 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.maxResults=42; output.items.topicDetails.topicCategories=["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Video_game_culture"]
input.maxResults=30; output.items.topicDetails.topicCategories=["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Electronic_music","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Music"]
input.maxResults=42; output.items.topicDetails.topicCategories=["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Golf","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport"]
input.maxResults=9; output.items.topicDetails.topicCategories=["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lifestyle_(sociology)"]

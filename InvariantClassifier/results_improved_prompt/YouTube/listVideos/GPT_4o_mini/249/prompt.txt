Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                snippet:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video, including title, description, uploader, thumbnails and category.
                  properties:
                    publishedAt:
                      type: string
                      description: The date and time when the video was uploaded.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.snippet.publishedAt)==20

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 27720 examples in the requests data, with 3316 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.items.snippet.publishedAt=2022-10-04T16:00:04Z
output.items.snippet.publishedAt=2022-10-03T00:07:51Z
output.items.snippet.publishedAt=2022-09-26T23:00:26Z
output.items.snippet.publishedAt=2022-10-01T14:00:12Z
output.items.snippet.publishedAt=2022-10-03T04:56:10Z

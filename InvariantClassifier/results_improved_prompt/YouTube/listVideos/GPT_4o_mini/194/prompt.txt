Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
      - name: part
        in: query
        description: The *part* parameter specifies a comma-separated list of one or more video resource properties that the API response will include. If the parameter identifies a property that contains child properties, the child properties will be included in the response. For example, in a video resource, the snippet property contains the channelId, title, description, tags, and categoryId properties. As such, if you set *part=snippet*, the API response will contain all of those properties.
        required: true
        type: array
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                contentDetails:
                  type: object
                  description: Details about the content of a YouTube Video.
                  properties:
                    regionRestriction:
                      type: object
                      description: DEPRECATED Region restriction of the video.
                      properties:
                        blocked:
                          type: array
                          description: A list of region codes that identify countries where the video is blocked. If this property is present and a country is not listed in its value, then the video is viewable in that country. If this property is present and contains an empty list, the video is viewable in all countries.
                          items:
                            type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: size(input.part[]) != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])-1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two long scalars. Prints as x != y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 8 examples in the requests data, with 8 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.part=contentDetails%2Cid%2CtopicDetails; output.items.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked=["BY","IO","KP","RU","SS"]
input.part=statistics%2CcontentDetails; output.items.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked=["RU"]
input.part=contentDetails%2Cid%2CtopicDetails; output.items.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked=["RU"]
input.part=recordingDetails%2Csnippet%2Cplayer%2CcontentDetails; output.items.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked=["VN"]
input.part=recordingDetails%2Csnippet%2Cplayer%2CcontentDetails; output.items.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked=["RU"]

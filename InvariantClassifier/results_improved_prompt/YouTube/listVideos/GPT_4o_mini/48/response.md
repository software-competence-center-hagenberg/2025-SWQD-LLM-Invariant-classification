### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video has a `status` object containing an `uploadStatus` property. The `uploadStatus` can take on one of five possible values: `uploaded`, `processed`, `failed`, `rejected`, or `deleted`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `uploadStatus` will only ever be one of two values: `processed` or `uploaded`.

### Analysis
1. **Specification Conflict**: The invariant restricts the possible values of `uploadStatus` to only `processed` and `uploaded`. However, the Swagger definition explicitly states that `uploadStatus` can also be `failed`, `rejected`, or `deleted`. This directly contradicts the invariant.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: Although the invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls and no counterexamples were found, the existence of other valid values in the specification means that the invariant cannot be considered correct. The fact that only two distinct values were observed does not negate the possibility of other values existing.
3. **Semantic Context**: The invariant is semantically meaningful as it relates to the `uploadStatus`, but the restriction it imposes is not supported by the API specification.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant contradicts the explicit values defined in the Swagger specification, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear specification of possible values for `uploadStatus`.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided excerpt from the Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of resources. The response schema includes a `pageInfo` object that contains a `totalResults` property, which is defined as an integer. The description indicates that `totalResults` represents the total number of results in the result set.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.pageInfo.totalResults >= 0`, meaning that the total number of results returned by the API should always be non-negative.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Context**: The `totalResults` property is intended to represent the total number of items available in the result set. Logically, it makes sense that this number cannot be negative, as it counts items.

2. **Testing Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This strong evidence suggests that the invariant holds true under the tested conditions.

3. **Distinct Examples**: The presence of 164 distinct examples of `totalResults` values further supports the reliability of the invariant. All provided examples are positive integers, reinforcing the idea that the API consistently returns non-negative values for `totalResults`.

4. **Specification Alignment**: The Swagger definition does not contradict the invariant. It does not mention any scenarios where `totalResults` could be negative, which aligns with the invariant's assertion.

### Conclusion
Given the logical reasoning, the testing evidence, and the alignment with the API specification, the invariant `return.pageInfo.totalResults >= 0` is classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the extensive testing and lack of counterexamples.

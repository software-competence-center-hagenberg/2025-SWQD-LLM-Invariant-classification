Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                contentDetails:
                  type: object
                  description: Details about the content of a YouTube Video.
                  properties:
                    regionRestriction:
                      type: object
                      description: DEPRECATED Region restriction of the video.
                      properties:
                        allowed:
                          type: array
                          description: A list of region codes that identify countries where the video is viewable. If this property is present and a country is not listed in its value, then the video is blocked from appearing in that country. If this property is present and contains an empty list, the video is blocked in all countries.
                          items:
                            type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]) >= 1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.LowerBound
Invariant description: Represents the invariant x >= c, where c is a constant and x is a long scalar.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 732 examples in the requests data, with 48 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.items.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed=["AD","BL","FR","GF","GP","MC","MF","MQ","PF","PM","RE","WF","YT"]
output.items.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed=["JP"]
output.items.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed=["DE"]
output.items.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed=["KH","LA","TH"]
output.items.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed=["UA"]

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video has a `contentDetails` object containing a `regionRestriction` property. This property includes a `blocked` array, which lists countries where the video is blocked. Additionally, the `status` object contains a `license` property that indicates the video's license type.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.status.license` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`. This means that the license type of the video is expected to be found within the list of blocked regions.

### Analysis
1. **Semantics of Variables**: The `license` property indicates the licensing type of the video (e.g., `youtube`, `creativeCommon`), while the `blocked` array contains country codes where the video is restricted. These two properties represent different concepts: one is about licensing and the other about geographical restrictions. It does not make semantic sense to compare a license type with a list of country codes.

2. **Specification Contradiction**: The Swagger definition does not imply any relationship between the `license` and the `blocked` array. The license type does not determine or correlate with the countries where the video is blocked.

3. **Testing Evidence**: Although 50 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the lack of evidence against the invariant does not validate its correctness. The semantic mismatch suggests that the invariant is fundamentally flawed.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic mismatch between the `license` and `blocked` properties, and the lack of any logical connection between them as per the API's specification, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear semantic distinction between the two properties.

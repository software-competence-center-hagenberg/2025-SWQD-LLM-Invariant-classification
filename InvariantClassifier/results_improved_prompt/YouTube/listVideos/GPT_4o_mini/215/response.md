### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` with an optional query parameter `maxHeight`, which is an integer with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192. The response includes a `pageInfo` object that contains `resultsPerPage`, which is also an integer representing the number of results returned in a single page.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxHeight > return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage`, meaning that the value of `maxHeight` in the request must always be greater than the number of results returned in the response.

### Analysis
- The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found, which suggests a strong correlation between the two variables.
- The examples provided show that `maxHeight` values are significantly larger than `resultsPerPage`, which supports the invariant.
- However, the invariant implies a strict relationship that may not hold in all cases, especially if the API's behavior changes or if there are edge cases not covered by the current tests. For instance, if the API were to return a larger number of results based on certain conditions, it could potentially violate the invariant.
- The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `resultsPerPage` must always be less than `maxHeight`, and there may be scenarios where the API could return a higher number of results based on other factors not accounted for in the current tests.

### Conclusion
While the invariant has shown strong support from the data collected, the lack of explicit constraints in the API specification regarding the relationship between `maxHeight` and `resultsPerPage` introduces uncertainty. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** due to the potential for future changes in the API behavior or untested edge cases that could invalidate the invariant. 

**Verdict:** false-positive
**Confidence:** 0.85

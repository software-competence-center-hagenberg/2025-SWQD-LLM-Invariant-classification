### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource has a `contentDetails` property, which includes a `regionRestriction` object. This object has an `allowed` property, which is an array of strings representing country codes where the video is viewable. Additionally, the response includes a `player` object with an `embedWidth` property, which is a string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.player.embedWidth` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]`. This means that the embed width of the video player is expected to be one of the country codes listed in the `allowed` array of the region restriction.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Context**: The `embedWidth` property is a string that represents the width of the video player, while the `allowed` property is an array of strings that represent country codes. Comparing these two makes no semantic sense, as the embed width cannot logically be a country code. 
2. **Specification Contradiction**: The specification does not suggest any relationship between the `embedWidth` and the `allowed` country codes. Therefore, there is no basis for asserting that the embed width must be a member of the allowed countries.
3. **Testing Evidence**: Although 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the lack of counterexamples does not validate the invariant due to the semantic mismatch. It is possible that the invariant simply does not apply because the values being compared are fundamentally different.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic mismatch between `embedWidth` and the `allowed` country codes, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant does not hold true for every valid request on the API because it compares unrelated types of data. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

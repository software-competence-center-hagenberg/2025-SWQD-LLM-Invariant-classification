Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                statistics:
                  type: object
                  description: Statistics about the video, such as the number of times the video was viewed or liked.
                  properties:
                    commentCount:
                      type: string
                      description: The number of comments for the video.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.statistics.commentCount is Numeric

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsNumeric
Invariant description: Indicates that the characters of a string variable are always numeric. Represented as x is Numeric.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 25486 examples in the requests data, with 4983 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.items.statistics.commentCount=360760
output.items.statistics.commentCount=360763
output.items.statistics.commentCount=17489
output.items.statistics.commentCount=17487
output.items.statistics.commentCount=17481

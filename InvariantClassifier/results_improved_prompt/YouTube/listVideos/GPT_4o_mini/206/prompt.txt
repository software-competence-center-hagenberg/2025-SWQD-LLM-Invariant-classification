Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.items != null

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.NonZero
Invariant description: Represents long scalars that are non-zero. Prints as x != 0, or as x != null for pointer types.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

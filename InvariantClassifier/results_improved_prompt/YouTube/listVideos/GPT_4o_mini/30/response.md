### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that retrieves a list of video resources, including geographical coordinates (latitude) associated with each video. The latitude is specified as a number in degrees, which implies that it can take on a wide range of values, not limited to just a few specific ones.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.recordingDetails.location.latitude` can only be one of two specific values: {32.715738, 48.379433}. This is a restrictive condition that limits the possible values of latitude to just these two.

### Analysis
1. **Limited Examples**: While the invariant has been tested with 50 calls and found no counterexamples, the sample size is relatively small compared to the potential range of latitude values. The fact that only two distinct values were found does not necessarily imply that these are the only valid values.
2. **Geographical Coordinates**: Latitude can theoretically take any value between -90 and 90 degrees. The invariant's restriction to just two values contradicts the expected behavior of latitude values in a geographical context.
3. **Specification**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly limit the latitude to only these two values, suggesting that other values are permissible.

### Conclusion
Given the nature of geographical coordinates and the lack of explicit restrictions in the API specification, the invariant is likely a false-positive. It incorrectly restricts the latitude values to only two specific points, which is not supported by the broader context of latitude as a variable. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a false-positive with high confidence.

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

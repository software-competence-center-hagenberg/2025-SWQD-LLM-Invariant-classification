### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the `maxResults` parameter is an integer that specifies the maximum number of items to return, with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum length of 50. The `regionRestriction.blocked` property is an array of strings that lists countries where the video is blocked. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the value of `input.maxResults` should not equal the size of the array `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`. 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `maxResults` parameter is intended to limit the number of items returned in the response. The `regionRestriction.blocked` array indicates which countries have restrictions on viewing the video. 
2. **Semantics**: The two variables are semantically different: `maxResults` controls the number of items returned, while `regionRestriction.blocked` indicates the countries where the video is blocked. 
3. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 1000 calls without finding a counterexample, and 178 distinct examples have been collected. However, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant is universally true. 
4. **Potential for False-Positive**: The invariant could be a false-positive because there is no inherent relationship between the number of items requested (`maxResults`) and the number of countries that block the video. It is possible for `maxResults` to equal the size of `regionRestriction.blocked` in certain scenarios, especially if the API behavior changes or if the data varies. 

### Conclusion
Given the semantic disconnect between the two variables and the fact that the invariant does not account for all possible scenarios, it is likely a false-positive. The invariant does not hold universally across all valid requests, as the relationship between `maxResults` and `regionRestriction.blocked` is not defined in the API specification. 

Therefore, the classification is **false-positive** with a confidence of 0.85 due to the lack of counterexamples but the potential for the invariant to fail under different conditions.

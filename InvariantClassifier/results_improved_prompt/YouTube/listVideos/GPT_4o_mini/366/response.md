### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of resources from the YouTube API, with a query parameter `maxWidth` that is an integer with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192. The response includes a `pageInfo` object that contains `totalResults`, which is also an integer representing the total number of results available.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxWidth != return.pageInfo.totalResults`, meaning that the value of `maxWidth` in the request should not equal the `totalResults` in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Nature of Variables**: The `maxWidth` parameter is intended to specify the maximum height for the player, while `totalResults` indicates the total number of resources available. These two values serve different purposes and are not directly related. 
2. **Data from Calls**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found, which suggests that the invariant holds in the tested scenarios. However, the absence of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant is universally true, especially since the relationship between `maxWidth` and `totalResults` is not inherently defined.
3. **Specification Review**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `maxWidth` must not equal `totalResults`, nor does it provide a logical basis for this relationship. The fact that `maxWidth` is a parameter for display purposes and `totalResults` is a count of items suggests that they can potentially be equal, although it may not be common.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the relationship between two variables that are semantically unrelated and that the Swagger definition does not support this restriction, it is likely a false-positive. The lack of counterexamples in the tested calls is notable, but it does not outweigh the semantic disconnection between the two variables. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** with high confidence due to the reasoning provided.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            nextPageToken:
              type: string
              description: The token that can be used as the value of the pageToken parameter to retrieve the next page in the result set.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.nextPageToken)==6

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 8842 examples in the requests data, with 50 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.nextPageToken=CA0QAA
output.nextPageToken=CB0QAA
output.nextPageToken=CDIQAA
output.nextPageToken=CA4QAA
output.nextPageToken=CA8QAA

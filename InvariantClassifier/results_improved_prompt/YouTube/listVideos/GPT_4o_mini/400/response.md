### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that retrieves a list of video resources, which may include details about live streaming. The relevant property in the response is `liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime`, which is a string representing the scheduled end time of a broadcast.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of `return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime` is always 20 characters. This suggests that every valid response will have a `scheduledEndTime` string that is exactly 20 characters long.

### Analysis
1. **Format of the DateTime String**: The examples provided for `scheduledEndTime` follow the ISO 8601 format for date and time, which is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. This format indeed has a length of 20 characters, as it includes:
   - 4 characters for the year (YYYY)
   - 2 characters for the month (MM)
   - 2 characters for the day (DD)
   - 1 character for the letter 'T'
   - 2 characters for the hour (HH)
   - 2 characters for the minute (MM)
   - 2 characters for the second (SS)
   - 1 character for the letter 'Z'

   Therefore, the total is 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 20 characters.

2. **Absence of Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples have been found. This is a strong indication that the invariant holds true for the current implementation of the API.

3. **Specification Compliance**: The specification states that if the `scheduledEndTime` is empty or not present, the broadcast is scheduled to continue indefinitely. However, it does not specify what the length of the string should be when it is present. Given that all observed examples conform to the 20-character length, and no other lengths have been observed, this supports the invariant.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the Swagger definition, the format of the `scheduledEndTime`, and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant that `LENGTH(return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime) == 20` is classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the consistent format and the extensive testing conducted.

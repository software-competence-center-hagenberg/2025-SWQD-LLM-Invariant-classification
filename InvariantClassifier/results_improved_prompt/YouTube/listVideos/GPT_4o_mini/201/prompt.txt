Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                snippet:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video, including title, description, uploader, thumbnails and category.
                  properties:
                    tags:
                      type: array
                      description: A list of keyword tags associated with the video. Tags may contain spaces.
                      items:
                        type: string
              items:
                topicDetails:
                  type: object
                  description: Freebase topic information related to the video.
                  properties:
                    topicCategories:
                      type: array
                      description: A list of Wikipedia URLs that provide a high-level description of the video's content.
                      items:
                        type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: size(return.snippet.tags[])-1 >= size(return.topicDetails.topicCategories[])-1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of >= between two long scalars. Prints as x >= y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 106 examples in the requests data, with 55 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 4 example values of the variables:
output.items.snippet.tags=["Shorts","Sidemen"]; output.items.topicDetails.topicCategories=["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Video_game_culture"]
output.items.snippet.tags=["marvel","comics"]; output.items.topicDetails.topicCategories=["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Film"]
output.items.snippet.tags=["All Blacks","New Zealand Rugby","Rugby","Rugby Union"]; output.items.topicDetails.topicCategories=["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport"]
output.items.snippet.tags=["veritasium","science","physics"]; output.items.topicDetails.topicCategories=["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Knowledge"]

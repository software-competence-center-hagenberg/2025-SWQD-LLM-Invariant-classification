### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. Each video resource includes a `player` object that contains two properties: `embedHtml` (a string representing an iframe tag for video playback) and `embedWidth` (a string representing the width of the embed).

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.player.embedWidth` is a substring of `return.player.embedHtml`. This means that the value of `embedWidth` should appear within the value of `embedHtml`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `embedHtml` property typically contains an HTML `<iframe>` tag, which includes attributes such as `width`. The `embedWidth` is presumably intended to specify the width of the video player. 
2. **Semantic Relationship**: It is reasonable to expect that the `embedWidth` might be used in the `embedHtml` string, particularly as an attribute in the iframe tag (e.g., `<iframe width="embedWidth">`). However, the invariant suggests that `embedWidth` must be a substring of `embedHtml`, which is a stricter requirement. 
3. **Testing and Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, and there are 21,277 examples in the request data, indicating a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true across various scenarios. 
4. **Potential Exceptions**: However, it is important to consider that while `embedWidth` may often be included in `embedHtml`, it is not guaranteed. The `embedHtml` could potentially contain other values or formats that do not include `embedWidth` as a substring. 

### Conclusion
Given the strong evidence from testing and the nature of the variables, it seems likely that the invariant holds true in the majority of cases. However, the strict nature of the substring requirement raises the possibility of exceptions. Therefore, while the invariant is likely a true-positive, there remains a slight uncertainty due to the potential for variations in the `embedHtml` content. 

Overall, I would classify this invariant as a **true-positive** with high confidence.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the `scheduledEndTime` property is a string that represents the time the broadcast is scheduled to end. It explicitly states that if the value is empty or the property is not present, the broadcast is scheduled to continue indefinitely. This implies that `scheduledEndTime` can be absent or an empty string, which contradicts the invariant that states it must always be a timestamp.

### Invariant
The invariant claims that `return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime` is always a timestamp in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmZ`. 

### Analysis
While the invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls and no counterexamples were found, the Swagger definition allows for the possibility that `scheduledEndTime` can be empty or not present. This means that there are valid scenarios where the invariant does not hold, as the invariant does not account for these cases. The presence of valid examples does not negate the fact that the invariant is too restrictive based on the API's specification.

### Conclusion
Given the explicit allowance in the API specification for `scheduledEndTime` to be empty or absent, the invariant cannot be classified as a true-positive. Therefore, it is a false-positive.

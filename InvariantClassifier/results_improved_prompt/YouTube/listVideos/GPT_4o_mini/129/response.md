### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response includes an array of items, each containing `contentDetails` and `liveStreamingDetails`. The `contentDetails` has a property `regionRestriction`, which includes a `blocked` array that lists countries where the video is blocked. The `liveStreamingDetails` contains `actualStartTime`, which indicates when a live broadcast started.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualStartTime` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`. This implies that the actual start time of a live stream is somehow related to the countries where the video is blocked.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Relevance**: The `actualStartTime` is a timestamp indicating when a live broadcast started, while the `blocked` array contains country codes where the video is not available. There is no semantic relationship between a timestamp and a list of country codes. It does not make sense to check if a time is a member of a list of strings representing country codes.

2. **Specification Contradiction**: The Swagger definition does not suggest any relationship between `actualStartTime` and the `blocked` countries. The invariant seems to impose a restriction that is not supported by the API's specification.

3. **Testing Evidence**: Although 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the lack of counterexamples does not validate the invariant due to the semantic mismatch. Just because no examples were found does not mean the invariant is true; it may simply be that the conditions for it to be true were never met.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of semantic relevance between the two fields and the absence of any supporting evidence in the API specification, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear mismatch in semantics and the explicit nature of the API's response structure.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
      - name: maxHeight
        in: query
        required: false
        type: integer
        minimum: 72
        maxLength: 8192
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                snippet:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video, including title, description, uploader, thumbnails and category.
                  properties:
                    tags:
                      type: array
                      description: A list of keyword tags associated with the video. Tags may contain spaces.
                      items:
                        type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.maxHeight > size(return.snippet.tags[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11801 examples in the requests data, with 9890 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.maxHeight=3121; output.items.snippet.tags=["Katy","Perry","Harleys","Hawaii","(Vertical","Video)","Capitol","Records","Pop"]
input.maxHeight=2710; output.items.snippet.tags=["beamng","beamng deutsch","beamng mods","beamng paluten","paluten"]
input.maxHeight=388; output.items.snippet.tags=["music for gaming","dota 2","music for gaming 2019","bass","cool music"]
input.maxHeight=549; output.items.snippet.tags=["Soulwave","Régebben","Más","Voltál","Universal","Music","Kft.","Hungary","Pop"]
input.maxHeight=1130; output.items.snippet.tags=["music for gaming","dota 2","music for gaming 2019","bass","cool music"]

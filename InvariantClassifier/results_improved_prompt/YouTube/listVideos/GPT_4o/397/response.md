### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` with a `GET` method. The endpoint retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered. The response includes a `pageInfo` object, which contains details about paging. Specifically, the `resultsPerPage` property is an integer that describes the number of results included in the API response.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 0`. This invariant suggests that the `resultsPerPage` field in the response is always greater than or equal to zero.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `resultsPerPage` field represents the number of results returned in a single page. Semantically, it makes sense for this number to be non-negative. A negative number of results per page would be illogical in the context of pagination.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 51 distinct examples were observed, all adhering to the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on `resultsPerPage` being non-negative, but given its role in pagination, it is reasonable to assume it should be non-negative.

4. **Common Practices**: In pagination, it is common for the number of results per page to be zero or a positive integer, as this represents the count of items returned.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic context of the `resultsPerPage` field, the empirical evidence from 10,000 calls, and the logical consistency with common practices in pagination, the invariant `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 0` is likely a "true-positive". It is reasonable to conclude that this invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Operation**: `GET`
- **Parameter**: `maxResults`
  - **Type**: integer
  - **Description**: Specifies the maximum number of items to return.
  - **Constraints**: Minimum value is 1, maximum length is 50.
- **Response**: Contains an array of `items`, each with `contentDetails`.
  - **`regionRestriction.blocked`**: An array of region codes where the video is blocked.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxResults != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])-1`
- **Type**: `IntNonEqual`
- **Description**: The invariant states that the `maxResults` parameter is not equal to the size of the `blocked` array minus one.

### Analysis

1. **Parameter and Response Relationship**:
   - `maxResults` is a parameter that limits the number of items returned, not directly related to the `blocked` regions.
   - `regionRestriction.blocked` is a list of countries where the video is blocked, which is unrelated to the number of results requested.

2. **Semantic Relevance**:
   - There is no semantic reason why the number of blocked regions should be directly related to the `maxResults` parameter.
   - The invariant suggests a relationship between the number of blocked regions and the `maxResults`, which is not supported by the API specification.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - Despite 10,000 calls and 1,116 examples, no counterexamples were found. However, this does not imply a logical relationship between the two variables.

4. **Specification Contradiction**:
   - The specification does not mention any relationship between `maxResults` and `regionRestriction.blocked`.
   - The invariant seems coincidental rather than a true reflection of the API's logic.

### Conclusion

The invariant `input.maxResults != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])-1` is likely a **false-positive**. The lack of semantic connection between `maxResults` and the `blocked` regions, combined with the absence of any specification support, suggests that the invariant is coincidental rather than a true invariant of the API.

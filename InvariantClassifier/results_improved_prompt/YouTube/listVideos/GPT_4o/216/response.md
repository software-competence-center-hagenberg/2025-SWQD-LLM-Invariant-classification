### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameter**: `maxHeight`
  - Type: integer
  - Minimum: 72
  - Maximum length: 8192
- **Response**: Contains `pageInfo` object with `totalResults` indicating the total number of results.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxHeight > return.pageInfo.totalResults`
- **Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `>` between two long scalars.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - `input.maxHeight` is a query parameter that likely controls the maximum height of a video resource, though its exact role is not explicitly defined in the swagger excerpt.
   - `return.pageInfo.totalResults` represents the total number of results available.
   - There is no direct semantic relationship between the maximum height of a video and the total number of results returned. These are unrelated concepts.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 89 examples were found, with 58 distinct examples supporting the invariant.
   - Example values show `input.maxHeight` consistently greater than `return.pageInfo.totalResults`.

3. **Specification Consideration**:
   - The swagger definition does not provide a direct link between `maxHeight` and `totalResults`, suggesting that the invariant may be coincidental rather than intentional.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic relationship between `maxHeight` and `totalResults`, and the absence of specification linking these two variables, the invariant appears to be a coincidence rather than a true relationship. Despite the empirical evidence, the invariant is likely a false-positive due to the unrelated nature of the variables involved.

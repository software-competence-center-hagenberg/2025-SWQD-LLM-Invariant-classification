### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameter**: `maxWidth` (query parameter)
  - Type: integer
  - Minimum: 72
  - Maximum Length: 8192 (though this seems like a mistake, as maxLength is typically for strings)
- **Response**: 200 OK
  - **Schema**: Object
    - **Properties**:
      - `items`: Array
        - **Items**:
          - `snippet`: Object
            - **Properties**:
              - `thumbnails`: Object
                - **Properties**:
                  - `standard`: Object
                    - **Properties**:
                      - `height`: Integer (Optional)

### Invariant
- **Invariant**: `input.maxWidth > return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.height`
- **Type**: `IntGreaterThan`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `>` between two long scalars. Prints as `x > y`.

### Analysis
- **Parameter**: `maxWidth` is a query parameter intended to specify the maximum width of a player.
- **Response Field**: `return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.height` is the height of a thumbnail image.
- **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant compares `maxWidth`, which is a width constraint for a player, with `height`, which is a dimension of a thumbnail image. These are two different dimensions (width vs. height), and semantically, there is no direct correlation between them.
- **Empirical Evidence**: We have 100 calls with no counterexamples and 12 examples supporting the invariant, with 7 distinct examples.

### Conclusion
- The invariant compares two semantically unrelated dimensions: width (maxWidth) and height (thumbnail height). The lack of counterexamples in 100 calls might be due to the specific data or constraints used during testing, but it does not inherently validate the invariant as true-positive due to the lack of semantic correlation.
- **Verdict**: `false-positive`
- **Confidence**: 0.7 (The semantic mismatch between width and height suggests a false-positive, despite the lack of counterexamples in the tested calls.)

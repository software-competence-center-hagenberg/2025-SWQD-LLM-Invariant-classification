### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameter**: `maxHeight`
  - Type: integer
  - Minimum: 72
  - Maximum length: 8192
- **Response**:
  - **Property**: `pageInfo`
    - **Property**: `totalResults`
      - Type: integer
      - Description: The total number of results in the result set.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxHeight != return.pageInfo.totalResults`
- **Invariant Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `!=` between two long scalars.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - `input.maxHeight` is a query parameter that likely influences the dimensions or filtering of the video resources returned. It is not directly related to the number of results (`totalResults`) returned in the response.
   - `return.pageInfo.totalResults` indicates the total number of results available in the result set, which is conceptually different from `maxHeight` as it pertains to the count of resources, not their dimensions.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - We have 1000 calls with no counterexamples found.
   - 895 examples were found, with 593 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.
   - Example values show no apparent correlation between `maxHeight` and `totalResults`.

3. **Specification Check**:
   - The specification does not imply any direct relationship between `maxHeight` and `totalResults`.
   - The invariant seems to hold due to the lack of semantic connection between the two fields.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic difference between `maxHeight` and `totalResults`, and the empirical evidence supporting the invariant, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a "true-positive." The lack of a direct relationship and the large number of supporting examples without counterexamples further reinforce this conclusion.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes an endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` with a `GET` method. The response schema includes a `pageInfo` object, which contains a `resultsPerPage` property. This property is described as an integer representing the number of results included in the API response.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 1`. This invariant suggests that the number of results per page is always at least 1.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `resultsPerPage` property is meant to indicate how many results are returned in a single page. It is logical to assume that if a page is returned, it should contain at least one result, as a page with zero results might not be considered a valid page of results.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested over 100 calls without finding a counterexample.
   - 150 examples were found, with 35 distinct values, all supporting the invariant.
   - Example values provided (2, 3, 1, 44, 45) all satisfy the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `resultsPerPage` can be zero. The description implies that it represents the number of results, which logically should be at least 1 if a page is returned.

4. **Common API Practices**:
   - In typical REST API design, pagination usually implies that a page contains at least one item unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic reasoning, empirical evidence, and common practices in API design, the invariant `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 1` is consistent with the expected behavior of the API. The absence of counterexamples in a reasonable number of tests further supports this conclusion.

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive** with high confidence.

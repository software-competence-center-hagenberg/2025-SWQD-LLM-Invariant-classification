Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                statistics:
                  type: object
                  description: Statistics about the video, such as the number of times the video was viewed or liked.
                  properties:
                    viewCount:
                      type: string
                      description: The number of times the video has been viewed.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.statistics.viewCount is Numeric

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsNumeric
Invariant description: Indicates that the characters of a string variable are always numeric. Represented as x is Numeric.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 26237 examples in the requests data, with 11249 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.items.statistics.viewCount=154428
return.items.statistics.viewCount=154429
return.items.statistics.viewCount=508675
return.items.statistics.viewCount=991667
return.items.statistics.viewCount=179725

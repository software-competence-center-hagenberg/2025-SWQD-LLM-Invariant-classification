### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered. The response schema includes an `items` array, where each item has a `contentDetails` object. Within `contentDetails`, there is a `regionRestriction` object, which is marked as DEPRECATED. This object has an `allowed` property, which is an array of strings. These strings represent region codes for countries where the video is viewable. If the `allowed` list is empty, the video is blocked in all countries.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]) one of { 9, 80, 94 }`. This means that the size of the `allowed` array is always either 9, 80, or 94.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not provide any constraints on the size of the `allowed` array. It only describes the purpose of the array and what an empty array signifies.

2. **Data and Examples**: The invariant was tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found. There were 4 examples in the request data, with 3 distinct examples, all conforming to the invariant.

3. **Semantic Analysis**: The `allowed` array is meant to list region codes. The number of region codes can vary significantly depending on the video's licensing agreements or distribution rights. There is no inherent reason why the list should be restricted to sizes of 9, 80, or 94.

4. **Deprecation Note**: The `regionRestriction` field is marked as DEPRECATED, which suggests that it might not be actively maintained or updated, potentially affecting the data consistency.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of specification constraints on the size of the `allowed` array and the semantic nature of the field, it is unlikely that the array size is inherently restricted to 9, 80, or 94. The invariant is likely a result of the specific data encountered during testing rather than a true constraint of the API.

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the semantic analysis and the lack of specification support for the invariant.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                contentDetails:
                  type: object
                  description: Details about the content of a YouTube Video.
                  properties:
                    dimension:
                      type: string
                      description: The value of dimension indicates whether the video is available in 3D or in 2D.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: "return.contentDetails.dimension one of { ""2d"", ""3d"" }"

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.OneOfString
Invariant description: Represents String variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 28274 examples in the requests data, with 2 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 2 example values of the variables:
return.items.contentDetails.dimension=3d
return.items.contentDetails.dimension=2d

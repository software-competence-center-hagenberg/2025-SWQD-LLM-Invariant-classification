### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` that retrieves a list of video resources. Each video resource contains a `contentDetails` object, which includes a `dimension` property. The `dimension` property is described as a string that indicates whether the video is available in 3D or 2D.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.contentDetails.dimension one of { "2d", "3d" }`.

### Analysis
- **Swagger Specification**: The Swagger definition explicitly states that the `dimension` property indicates whether the video is available in 3D or 2D. This directly aligns with the invariant which specifies that the `dimension` can only be "2d" or "3d".
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 28,274 examples were observed, with only two distinct values: "2d" and "3d".
- **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant makes semantic sense given the context of the `dimension` property, which is to specify the dimensionality of the video content.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.contentDetails.dimension one of { "2d", "3d" }` is consistent with the Swagger definition and the observed data from the API calls. The specification explicitly mentions the two possible values for the `dimension` property, and the empirical evidence supports this invariant without any counterexamples.

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive** with high confidence.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET

  - Type: integer
  - Constraints: minimum 72, maximum length 8192
- **Response**: 200 OK
  - **Schema**: Object

                    - **Properties**:
                      - `width`: integer (Optional)

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxHeight != return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width`
- **Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `!=` between two long scalars.

### Analysis

1. **Parameter and Response Context**:
   - `input.maxHeight` is a query parameter that specifies a maximum height constraint for some aspect of the video retrieval.
   - `return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width` is the width of a high-quality thumbnail image in the response.

2. **Semantic Relationship**:
   - There is no direct semantic relationship between `maxHeight` (a constraint on height) and `width` (a property of a thumbnail image).
   - The invariant suggests that these two values are never equal, which aligns with the lack of a direct relationship.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 1,406 examples were found, with 1,077 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.
   - Example values consistently show `input.maxHeight` and `return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width` as different numbers.

4. **Specification Check**:
   - The swagger definition does not imply any relationship between `maxHeight` and `thumbnails.high.width`.
   - The `maxHeight` parameter is not directly related to the width of thumbnails in the response.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic connection between the two fields and the empirical evidence supporting the invariant, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant is likely to hold due to the unrelated nature of the two fields and the extensive testing without counterexamples.

### Confidence

The confidence in this classification is high due to the large number of tests conducted and the lack of any logical connection between the two fields that would suggest they could be equal.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Parameter**: `maxWidth` (query parameter)
  - Type: integer
  - Minimum: 72
  - Maximum length: 8192
- **Response**: Contains a list of items, each with `contentDetails`.
  - `contentDetails` includes `regionRestriction` which has `allowed` (an array of strings representing region codes).

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`input.maxWidth > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[])`

This invariant suggests that the `maxWidth` parameter in the request is always greater than the number of elements in the `allowed` array in the response.

### Analysis

1. **Parameter and Response Relationship**:
   - `maxWidth` is a parameter related to the player size, specifically its width. It does not have a direct semantic relationship with the `allowed` regions in the `regionRestriction` of a video.
   - The `allowed` array represents the countries where the video is viewable, which is unrelated to the `maxWidth` parameter.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 290 examples were found, with 248 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.

3. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The invariant compares a parameter related to video display size with a list of region codes, which are semantically unrelated.
   - The invariant holds empirically, but the lack of semantic connection suggests it might be coincidental rather than a true logical relationship.

### Conclusion

Despite the empirical evidence supporting the invariant, the lack of a logical or semantic relationship between `maxWidth` and the size of `allowed` regions suggests that this invariant is likely a coincidence. The invariant does not make sense in the context of the API's intended functionality, which is to filter videos by region and not by display size.

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                suggestions:
                  type: object
                  description: Specifies suggestions on how to improve video content, including encoding hints, tag suggestions, and editor suggestions.
                  properties:
                    editorSuggestions:
                      type: array
                      description: A list of video editing operations that might improve the video quality or playback experience of the uploaded video.
                      items:
                        type: string
                  properties:
                    processingErrors:
                      type: array
                      description: A list of errors that will prevent YouTube from successfully processing the uploaded video video. These errors indicate that, regardless of the video's current processing status, eventually, that status will almost certainly be failed.
                      items:
                        type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.suggestions.editorSuggestions == return.suggestions.processingErrors

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual

Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

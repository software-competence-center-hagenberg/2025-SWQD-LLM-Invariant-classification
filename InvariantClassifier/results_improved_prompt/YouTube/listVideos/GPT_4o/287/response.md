### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` that retrieves a list of video resources. The response includes a list of items, each containing a `snippet` and `contentDetails` object. The `snippet` object includes a `thumbnails` object with a `default` thumbnail, which has a `width` property. The `contentDetails` object includes a `regionRestriction` object, which has a `blocked` property that is an array of strings representing region codes where the video is blocked.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

```
return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width % size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) == 0
```

This invariant suggests that the width of the default thumbnail divides evenly by the number of blocked regions.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant compares two unrelated properties: the width of a thumbnail and the number of regions where a video is blocked. There is no semantic reason why the width of a thumbnail should be related to the number of blocked regions.

2. **Swagger Definition**: The Swagger definition does not suggest any relationship between the `width` of a thumbnail and the `blocked` regions. The `width` is an optional property of an image, while `blocked` is a list of region codes.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held true in 100 API calls, with 4 distinct examples. However, the lack of a semantic relationship between the two properties suggests that the invariant may be coincidental rather than indicative of a true relationship.

4. **Statistical Significance**: While the invariant held true in all tested cases, the sample size is relatively small (100 calls), and the examples provided all have the same width (120), which may not be representative of all possible values.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic connection between the thumbnail width and the number of blocked regions, and the fact that the invariant is based on a small sample size with limited variability in the `width` values, it is likely a "false-positive". The invariant appears to be coincidental rather than a true invariant of the API.

**Confidence**: 0.7

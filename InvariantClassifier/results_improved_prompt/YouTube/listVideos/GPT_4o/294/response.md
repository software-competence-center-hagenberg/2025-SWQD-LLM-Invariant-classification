### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of video resources. The request can include a query parameter `id`, which is an array of video IDs. The response includes a list of items, each containing a `snippet` object with details about the video, including `thumbnails`. The `thumbnails` object can have a `maxres` property, which includes a `width` property representing the width of the thumbnail image.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.width > size(input.id[])`. This suggests that the width of the `maxres` thumbnail for a video is greater than the number of IDs provided in the `id` query parameter.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant compares the width of a thumbnail image to the number of video IDs provided in the request. Semantically, these two values are unrelated. The width of a thumbnail is determined by the video content and YouTube's processing, while the number of IDs is determined by the user's request.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 463 examples were found where the invariant held, with 301 distinct examples.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The Swagger specification does not provide any direct correlation between the number of IDs and the width of the thumbnail. The width is an optional property and may vary independently of the number of IDs.

### Conclusion

Despite the lack of counterexamples in a large number of tests, the invariant compares two semantically unrelated quantities. The width of a thumbnail should not logically depend on the number of IDs provided. Therefore, this invariant is likely a "false-positive" due to the lack of a logical connection between the two variables.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of video resources. The request can include a query parameter `id`, which is an array of video IDs. The response includes an array of `items`, each containing a `snippet` object. The `snippet` object includes a `thumbnails` object, which has a `medium` property. This `medium` property includes a `width` property, which is an integer representing the width of the thumbnail image.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.width > size(input.id[])`. This means that the width of the medium thumbnail image for each video returned is greater than the number of video IDs provided in the request.

### Analysis

1. **Request Parameter (`input.id[]`)**: This is an array of video IDs. The size of this array represents the number of video IDs requested.

2. **Response Field (`return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.width`)**: This is the width of the medium thumbnail image for a video. According to the examples provided, this width is consistently 320.

3. **Invariant Logic**: The invariant states that the width of the thumbnail (320 in the examples) is greater than the number of video IDs requested. Given the examples:
   - `input.id=VmUc5JycrDg%2CjfKfPfyJRdk%2CIJIdOOgsepQ%2CnjkKF9tHX04%2C-VIjZMdYu5A` has 5 IDs.
   - `input.id=uCpE6z999Uk%2CHndV87XpkWg` has 2 IDs.
   - `input.id=G4UspBs3DGQ` has 1 ID.
   - `input.id=bTgRLQHGouw` has 1 ID.
   - `input.id=acBCHmS6XCs%2CzZa8PFYtWr4%2CergSFrv6NRA%2CJ8hE0kTSJ0s` has 4 IDs.

   In all cases, the width (320) is greater than the number of IDs.

4. **Empirical Evidence**: With 10000 calls and no counterexamples, and 562 examples supporting the invariant, the empirical evidence strongly supports the invariant.

5. **Semantic Analysis**: The width of a thumbnail is a fixed property of the video resource and does not logically relate to the number of IDs requested. The invariant seems coincidental rather than semantically meaningful.

### Conclusion

Despite the strong empirical evidence, the invariant lacks semantic meaning. The width of a thumbnail should not logically depend on the number of video IDs requested. This suggests that the invariant is a "false-positive" due to its lack of logical connection between the two variables involved.

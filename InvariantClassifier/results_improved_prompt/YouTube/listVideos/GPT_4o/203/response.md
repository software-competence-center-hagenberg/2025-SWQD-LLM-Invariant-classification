### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of video resources. The request can include a query parameter `id`, which is an array of video IDs. The response includes a `pageInfo` object, which contains `resultsPerPage`, an integer indicating the number of results included in the API response.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage == size(input.id[])`. This suggests that the number of results per page in the response is equal to the number of IDs provided in the request.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not explicitly state that the number of results per page (`resultsPerPage`) must match the number of IDs provided. The `resultsPerPage` field is described as the number of results included in the API response, which could be influenced by other factors such as server-side limitations, filtering, or pagination settings.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found. There were 28 examples supporting the invariant, with 19 distinct examples. This suggests a strong empirical correlation between the number of IDs provided and the `resultsPerPage` value.

3. **Potential for False Positives**: Despite the empirical evidence, the invariant assumes a direct correlation between the input size and the results per page, which is not explicitly guaranteed by the API specification. The API could potentially return fewer results than requested due to various reasons such as video availability, access restrictions, or server-side filtering.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of explicit guarantee in the API specification and the potential for other factors to influence the `resultsPerPage`, the invariant is likely a "false-positive". The empirical evidence is strong but not definitive due to the absence of specification support.

**Confidence**: 0.7

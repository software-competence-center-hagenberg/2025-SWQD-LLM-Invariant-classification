### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameters**:
  - `maxWidth`: An optional query parameter of type integer, with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192.
- **Response**:
  - The response is an object containing an array of `items`.
  - Each item has a `snippet` object, which includes `thumbnails`.
  - `thumbnails` has a `high` object with a `width` property, which is optional.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxWidth > return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width`
- **Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `>` between two long scalars.

### Analysis

- **Parameter `maxWidth`**: This parameter is intended to specify the maximum width for the player, not directly related to the thumbnail width.
- **Response `thumbnails.high.width`**: This is the width of a high-quality thumbnail image, which is optional and not directly constrained by `maxWidth`.
- **Example Data**: In all provided examples, `input.maxWidth` is greater than `return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width` (480).

### Conclusion

The invariant suggests that the `maxWidth` parameter is always greater than the `width` of the high-quality thumbnail in the response. However, the `maxWidth` parameter is meant for the player, not thumbnails, indicating a semantic mismatch. The invariant holds in the examples, but this could be coincidental due to the specific data set used in testing. The specification does not imply any direct relationship between these two fields.

Given the semantic mismatch and lack of specification support, this invariant is likely a **false-positive**.

### Confidence

The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear semantic mismatch and lack of specification support for the invariant.

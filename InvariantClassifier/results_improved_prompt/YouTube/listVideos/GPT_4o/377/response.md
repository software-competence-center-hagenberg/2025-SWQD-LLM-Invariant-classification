### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` that retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a `status` object. This `status` object has two boolean properties:

- `embeddable`: Indicates if the video can be embedded on another website.
- `selfDeclaredMadeForKids`: Indicates if the video is self-declared as made for kids.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.status.embeddable == return.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids`

This invariant suggests that the `embeddable` status of a video is always equal to its `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` status.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `embeddable` property is related to whether a video can be embedded on other websites, which is typically a decision made by the content owner or based on copyright settings.
   - The `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` property is related to the content of the video and whether it is suitable for children, which is a compliance measure with regulations like COPPA.
   - These two properties serve very different purposes and are likely governed by different rules and regulations.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 1000 calls, and no counterexamples were found.
   - However, only 1 distinct example was found where both properties were `true`.

3. **Specification and Context**:
   - The specification does not suggest any inherent relationship between these two properties.
   - Given the distinct purposes of these properties, it is unlikely that they are inherently equal across all possible videos.

### Conclusion

The invariant `return.status.embeddable == return.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids` is likely a **false-positive**. The semantic purposes of `embeddable` and `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` are distinct, and there is no specification or logical reason to assume they should always be equal. The lack of counterexamples in 1000 calls is not sufficient to override the semantic mismatch between these properties.

**Confidence**: 0.9 (High confidence due to semantic analysis and lack of specification support for the invariant)

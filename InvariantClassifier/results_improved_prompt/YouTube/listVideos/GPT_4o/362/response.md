### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema includes an array of `items`, where each item has `contentDetails` and `snippet` objects. 

- `contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked`: This is an array of strings representing region codes where the video is blocked. The description notes that if this property is present and contains an empty list, the video is viewable in all countries.
- `snippet.tags`: This is an array of strings representing keyword tags associated with the video. Tags may contain spaces.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) - 1 != size(return.snippet.tags[])`

This invariant suggests that the size of the `blocked` array minus one is not equal to the size of the `tags` array.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: 
   - The `blocked` array and the `tags` array represent completely different concepts. The `blocked` array is related to geographical restrictions, while the `tags` array is related to metadata for categorizing or searching videos.
   - There is no inherent reason why the size of these two arrays should be related in any consistent manner across different videos.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 500 calls and no counterexamples were found.
   - 20 examples were found, with 19 distinct examples supporting the invariant.

3. **Specification Consideration**:
   - The specification does not indicate any relationship between the number of blocked regions and the number of tags. 
   - The `blocked` property is marked as deprecated, which might affect its presence or usage in future API responses.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic irrelevance between the two fields (`blocked` and `tags`), the invariant seems coincidental rather than a true invariant of the API. The lack of counterexamples might be due to the specific dataset or usage patterns rather than a true invariant. Therefore, this invariant is likely a false-positive.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of video resources. The request can include a query parameter `id`, which is an array of video IDs. The response includes an object `pageInfo` with a property `totalResults`, which indicates the total number of results in the result set.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.pageInfo.totalResults == size(input.id[])`. This suggests that the total number of results returned by the API should be equal to the number of IDs provided in the request.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Definition**: The definition does not explicitly state that the number of results (`totalResults`) will always match the number of IDs provided. It only mentions that the `id` parameter is used to filter videos and that `totalResults` represents the total number of results.

2. **Examples and Calls**: Out of 100 calls, no counterexamples were found, and 28 examples supported the invariant. This suggests a strong correlation but does not confirm the invariant as universally true.

3. **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant assumes that for every ID provided, there is a corresponding video resource available. However, it is possible that some IDs may not correspond to any video (e.g., if an ID is invalid or the video is private/deleted), which would result in `totalResults` being less than the number of IDs.

4. **Potential for False Positives**: The invariant might hold true for the tested cases but could fail if an ID does not correspond to an existing video. The API might return fewer results than the number of IDs if some IDs are invalid or do not match any video.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of explicit confirmation in the API documentation and the potential for scenarios where the invariant does not hold (e.g., invalid or non-existent IDs), this invariant is likely a "false-positive." The examples tested might not cover all edge cases, such as invalid IDs or videos that are not accessible.

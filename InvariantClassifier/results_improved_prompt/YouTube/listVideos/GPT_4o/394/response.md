### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameters**:
  - `maxHeight`: An optional query parameter of type integer with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192.
- **Response**:
  - The response is an object containing an array of items.
  - Each item has a `snippet` object, which includes a `thumbnails` object.
  - The `thumbnails` object contains a `default` object with a `width` property, which is an optional integer.

### Invariant
- **Invariant**: `input.maxHeight != return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width`
- **Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual`
- **Description**: This invariant asserts that the `maxHeight` query parameter is not equal to the `width` of the default thumbnail in the response.

### Analysis
- **Parameter and Response Relationship**: The `maxHeight` parameter is a query parameter that might be used to filter or limit the height of resources retrieved, but there is no explicit indication in the swagger definition that it directly correlates with the `width` of the thumbnail images in the response.
- **Semantic Relevance**: The `maxHeight` parameter seems to be related to the height of resources, while the `width` of a thumbnail is a separate property. There is no semantic reason to expect these two values to be equal.
- **Empirical Evidence**: With 10,000 calls and no counterexamples found, along with 1,077 distinct examples supporting the invariant, there is strong empirical evidence that these two values are indeed not equal in practice.

### Conclusion
- **Verdict**: Given the lack of semantic connection between `maxHeight` and `thumbnail width`, and the strong empirical evidence from a large number of calls, this invariant is likely a "true-positive".
- **Confidence**: High confidence (0.95) due to the large number of examples and the lack of counterexamples.

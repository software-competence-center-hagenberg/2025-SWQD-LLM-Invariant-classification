### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered. The response includes an array of items, each containing `liveStreamingDetails`. Within `liveStreamingDetails`, there is a property `scheduledStartTime` which is described as a string representing the time that the broadcast is scheduled to begin.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledStartTime)==20`, which suggests that the `scheduledStartTime` string always has a fixed length of 20 characters.

### Analysis
- **Data Analysis**: We have 10000 calls with no counterexamples found, and 3263 examples with 360 distinct values. All examples provided have a length of 20 characters.
- **Example Values**: The example values provided are in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`, which is a standard ISO 8601 format for date-time strings in UTC. This format indeed has a fixed length of 20 characters.
- **Specification Alignment**: The swagger definition describes `scheduledStartTime` as a string representing a scheduled time. The examples align with a common date-time format that is expected to be consistent in length.
- **Semantic Context**: Given that `scheduledStartTime` is a date-time string, it is reasonable to expect it to adhere to a standard format, which in this case is ISO 8601.

### Conclusion
The invariant `LENGTH(return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledStartTime)==20` is likely a true-positive. The consistent length of 20 characters aligns with the expected format for date-time strings in ISO 8601, and the lack of counterexamples after 10000 calls further supports this conclusion.

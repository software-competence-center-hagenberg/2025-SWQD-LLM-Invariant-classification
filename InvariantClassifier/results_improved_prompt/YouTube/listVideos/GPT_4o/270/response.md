### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` with a `GET` method. The response schema includes an array of `items`, where each item has two relevant properties:

1. **player**:
   - **embedHtml**: A string representing an `<iframe>` tag for embedding a video player.

2. **status**:
   - **license**: A string representing the video's license, with possible values being `youtube` or `creativeCommon`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.status.license` is a substring of `return.player.embedHtml`.

### Analysis

- **License Values**: The `license` field can only take one of two values: `youtube` or `creativeCommon`.
- **Embed HTML**: The `embedHtml` field is an HTML string containing an `<iframe>` tag, which typically includes a URL and other attributes for embedding a video player.

Given the nature of the `embedHtml` field, it is unlikely that the specific strings `youtube` or `creativeCommon` would consistently appear as substrings within the HTML content. The `embedHtml` is expected to contain HTML tags, URLs, and possibly other attributes, but not necessarily the license type as a substring.

### Conclusion

The invariant suggests that the license type (`youtube` or `creativeCommon`) is always a substring of the `embedHtml` field. However, this is semantically unlikely given the typical structure of an HTML embed code. The fact that 100 calls did not produce a counterexample might be due to the specific data set or the way the API is currently configured, but it does not logically support the invariant as a true-positive.

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** with a high level of confidence.

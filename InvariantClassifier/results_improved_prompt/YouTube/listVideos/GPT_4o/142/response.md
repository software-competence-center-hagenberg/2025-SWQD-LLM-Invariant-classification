### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is designed to retrieve a list of video resources, potentially filtered by the query parameter `part`. The `part` parameter is required and specifies a list of video resource properties to include in the response. The response includes an array of items, each containing a `snippet` object with a `thumbnails` property. The `thumbnails` property includes a `default` object, which has a `height` property that is an optional integer.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height > size(input.part[])`

This invariant suggests that the height of the default thumbnail in the response is greater than the number of elements in the `part` array from the request.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `part` parameter is a list of properties requested in the response, while `thumbnails.default.height` is a property of the thumbnail image. There is no direct semantic relationship between the number of requested properties and the height of a thumbnail image.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not indicate any relationship between the `part` parameter and the `thumbnails.default.height`. The height of a thumbnail is likely determined by YouTube's internal logic and not by the number of properties requested.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held true for 10,000 calls without a counterexample, and there are 627 distinct examples supporting it. However, the lack of a semantic connection and specification support suggests that this might be coincidental.

### Conclusion

Despite the empirical evidence, the invariant lacks a logical basis in the API's specification and semantics. The relationship between the number of parts requested and the thumbnail height seems arbitrary and not grounded in the API's intended functionality. Therefore, this invariant is likely a "false-positive".

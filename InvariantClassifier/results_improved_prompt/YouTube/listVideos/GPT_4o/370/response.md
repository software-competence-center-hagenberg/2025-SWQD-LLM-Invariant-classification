### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of video resources. The request can include a query parameter `id`, which is an array of video IDs. The response includes a `pageInfo` object, which contains `totalResults`, indicating the total number of results available.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.pageInfo.totalResults >= size(input.id[])-1`. This suggests that the total number of results returned is at least the number of IDs provided in the request minus one.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant implies that for every video ID requested, there should be at least that many results minus one. This could be interpreted as the API returning at least one result for each ID, with the possibility of one ID not returning a result.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not explicitly state how the `totalResults` relates to the `id` parameter. However, it is reasonable to assume that if a valid ID is provided, the API should return a corresponding video, unless the video is unavailable or the ID is invalid.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: With 1000 calls and no counterexamples, and 366 examples found, this invariant seems to hold consistently. The examples provided also support this invariant, as the `totalResults` matches the number of IDs provided minus one in each case.

4. **Logical Consistency**: The invariant logically makes sense if we assume that the API is designed to return results for valid IDs, with the possibility of one ID not having a corresponding result due to various reasons (e.g., video removed, ID invalid).

### Conclusion
Given the empirical evidence and the logical consistency of the invariant with the API's likely behavior, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a "true-positive". The invariant is likely to hold for all valid requests, assuming the API behaves as expected.

### Confidence
The confidence in this classification is high due to the lack of counterexamples and the logical alignment of the invariant with the API's expected behavior.

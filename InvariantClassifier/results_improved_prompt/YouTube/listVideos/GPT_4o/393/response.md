### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` which retrieves a list of video resources. The endpoint accepts a query parameter `maxHeight`, which is an optional integer with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192. The response includes an array of items, each containing a `snippet` object with a `thumbnails` object. The `thumbnails` object has a `default` property which is an object containing a `height` property, representing the height of the thumbnail image.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `input.maxHeight != return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height`. This invariant suggests that the `maxHeight` parameter in the request is never equal to the `height` of the default thumbnail in the response.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `maxHeight` parameter is a filter applied to the request, potentially limiting the size of the thumbnails returned. The `height` of the thumbnail in the response is a property of the video resource's thumbnail.

2. **Logical Analysis**: The invariant suggests that the requested `maxHeight` is never equal to the `height` of the thumbnail returned. Given that `maxHeight` is a filter, it is plausible that the actual thumbnail heights are determined by the video resource itself and not directly by the `maxHeight` parameter. This means the `maxHeight` parameter may act as a ceiling or a constraint, but not necessarily an exact match for the thumbnail height.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: With 10000 calls and 1237 examples (1077 distinct), no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

4. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not explicitly state that `maxHeight` must match the thumbnail height, only that it is a parameter that can be used to filter results. This leaves room for the invariant to hold true, as the actual thumbnail heights may be determined by other factors.

### Conclusion

The invariant `input.maxHeight != return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height` is likely a "true-positive". The semantic roles of `maxHeight` and `thumbnail height` do not imply they should be equal, and the empirical evidence strongly supports the invariant. The specification does not contradict this finding, suggesting that the invariant holds under the described conditions.

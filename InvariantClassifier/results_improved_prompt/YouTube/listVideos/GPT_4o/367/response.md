### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is designed to retrieve a list of video resources, potentially filtered by certain parameters. One of the query parameters is `id`, which is an array of video IDs. The response includes a `pageInfo` object, which contains `resultsPerPage`, indicating the number of results returned in the API response.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage <= size(input.id[])`. This suggests that the number of results per page in the response should be less than or equal to the number of IDs provided in the request.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant makes logical sense in the context of the API. If you request a specific set of video IDs, the number of results returned (`resultsPerPage`) should logically be less than or equal to the number of IDs requested, since each ID corresponds to a potential video.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 API calls without finding a counterexample. Additionally, there are 1,263 distinct examples supporting the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The Swagger definition does not specify any behavior that would contradict this invariant. It is reasonable to assume that if you request a certain number of IDs, the API will return at most that many results, as it cannot return more results than IDs requested.

### Conclusion
Given the logical consistency of the invariant with the API's intended functionality, the lack of counterexamples after extensive testing, and the absence of any specification details that contradict the invariant, it is highly likely that this invariant is a true-positive.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of video resources. The response includes an array of items, each containing a `snippet` and `contentDetails` object. The `snippet` object includes a `thumbnails` object, which has a `default` thumbnail with an optional `width` property. The `contentDetails` object includes a `regionRestriction` object, which has a `blocked` array listing region codes where the video is blocked.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`

This invariant suggests that the width of the default thumbnail is not equal to the number of blocked regions for a video.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `width` of a thumbnail is a measurement in pixels, while the `blocked` array represents a list of country codes. These two fields are semantically unrelated.
   - There is no logical reason why the width of a thumbnail should correlate with the number of blocked regions.

2. **Swagger Specification**:
   - The `width` is optional and may not always be present.
   - The `blocked` array is deprecated and may not always be present or may be empty.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 474 examples were found, with 27 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.

### Conclusion

Despite the empirical evidence supporting the invariant, the lack of semantic correlation between the thumbnail width and the number of blocked regions suggests that this invariant is likely coincidental. The invariant does not hold due to any logical or specified relationship between the two fields, but rather due to the specific data encountered during testing. Therefore, it is classified as a "false-positive."

**Confidence**: Given the semantic analysis and the specification details, the confidence in this classification is high.

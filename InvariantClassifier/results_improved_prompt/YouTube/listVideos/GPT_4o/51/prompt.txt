Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                suggestions:
                  type: object
                  description: Specifies suggestions on how to improve video content, including encoding hints, tag suggestions, and editor suggestions.
                  properties:
                    tagSuggestions:
                      type: array
                      description: A list of keyword tags that could be added to the video's metadata to increase the likelihood that users will locate your video when searching or browsing on YouTube.
                      items:
                        type: object
                        properties:
                          categoryRestricts:
                            description: A set of video categories for which the tag is relevant. You can use this information to display appropriate tag suggestions based on the video category that the video uploader associates with the video. By default, tag suggestions are relevant for all categories if there are no restricts defined for the keyword.
                          tag:
                            description: The keyword tag suggested for the video.
                        description: A single tag suggestion with it's relevance information.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.suggestions.tagSuggestions == null

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.OneOfScalar
Invariant description: Represents long variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` that retrieves a list of video resources. Each video resource may have a `recordingDetails` object, which includes a `recordingDate` property. The `recordingDate` is described as a string representing the date and time when the video was recorded.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.recordingDetails.recordingDate)==20`, which suggests that the `recordingDate` string always has a fixed length of 20 characters.

### Analysis
1. **Data Format**: The example values provided for `recordingDate` are in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`, which is a standard ISO 8601 format for date and time. This format indeed has a fixed length of 20 characters.

2. **Number of Calls and Examples**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 398 examples were observed, with 23 distinct examples, all adhering to the 20-character length.

3. **Specification Alignment**: The Swagger definition specifies that `recordingDate` is a string representing the date and time. While it does not explicitly state the format, the examples and the lack of counterexamples strongly suggest that the format is consistent with ISO 8601, which naturally results in a 20-character string.

4. **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant makes semantic sense given the context. Dates and times are often represented in fixed formats, especially in APIs, to ensure consistency and ease of parsing.

### Conclusion
Given the extensive testing (10,000 calls) without any counterexamples, the consistency of the examples with the expected ISO 8601 format, and the semantic appropriateness of the invariant, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive." The invariant aligns well with the expected behavior of the API as described in the Swagger definition and observed in the data.

**Verdict**: True-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is designed to retrieve a list of video resources, potentially filtered by the `id` query parameter. The response includes an array of items, each containing `contentDetails` with a `regionRestriction` object. This object may have a `blocked` property, which is an array of region codes where the video is not viewable.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `size(input.id[]) % size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) == 0`. This suggests that the number of video IDs provided in the request divides evenly by the number of blocked regions in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Request and Response Relationship**: The `id` parameter is an array of video IDs, and the `blocked` property is an array of region codes. There is no direct semantic relationship between the number of video IDs requested and the number of regions where a video is blocked.
2. **Examples and Calls**: The invariant was tested with 1000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, only 5 distinct examples were provided, which is a limited dataset.
3. **Semantic Plausibility**: The invariant implies a mathematical relationship between two unrelated quantities: the number of video IDs and the number of blocked regions. There is no logical reason why the number of video IDs should divide evenly by the number of blocked regions.
4. **Specification**: The Swagger specification does not suggest any correlation between the `id` parameter and the `blocked` regions. The `blocked` array is related to the content of each video, not the request parameters.

### Conclusion
The invariant suggests a mathematical relationship between two unrelated quantities: the number of video IDs and the number of blocked regions. Given the lack of semantic connection and the limited dataset, this invariant is likely coincidental and not a true property of the API.

**Verdict**: false-positive

**Confidence**: 0.9

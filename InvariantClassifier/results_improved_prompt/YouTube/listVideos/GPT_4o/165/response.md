### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameters**:
  - `part`: A required query parameter that specifies a list of video resource properties to include in the response.
- **Response**:
  - Contains an array of `items`, each with a `snippet` object.
  - The `snippet` object includes `thumbnails`, which can have a `maxres` object with a `height` property.

### Invariant
- **Invariant**: `return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.height % size(input.part[]) == 0`
- **Invariant Type**: NumericInt$Divides
- **Description**: The height of the `maxres` thumbnail divides evenly by the number of elements in the `part` parameter.

### Analysis
- **Request Parameter**: `input.part` is a list of video resource properties. The size of this list is the divisor in the invariant.
- **Response Field**: `return.items.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.height` is the dividend in the invariant.
- **Examples**: All provided examples show `return.items.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.height` as 720, which is divisible by the size of `input.part` in each case.
- **Swagger Specification**: There is no explicit relationship between the number of parts requested and the height of the thumbnail. The height of the thumbnail is likely determined by the video resource itself, not by the number of parts requested.

### Conclusion
The invariant suggests a mathematical relationship between the number of requested parts and the height of a thumbnail, which is not supported by the API's specification. The height of a thumbnail is a property of the video resource and should not logically depend on the number of parts requested. The observed invariant is likely coincidental due to the limited number of calls and examples. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

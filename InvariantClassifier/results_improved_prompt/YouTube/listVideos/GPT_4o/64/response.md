### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameters**:
  - `maxHeight`: An optional query parameter of type integer with a minimum value of 72.
- **Response**:
  - Contains an array of `items`, each with a `snippet` object.
  - The `snippet` object includes `thumbnails`, which has a `maxres` object.
  - The `maxres` object has a `height` property, which is optional.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxHeight > return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.height`
- **Invariant Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `>` between two long scalars.

### Analysis

1. **Parameter and Response Context**:
   - `input.maxHeight` is a query parameter that specifies a maximum height constraint for filtering resources.
   - `return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.height` is an optional property representing the height of a thumbnail image.

2. **Examples and Calls**:
   - 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 19 examples were found, with 11 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.
   - Example values show `input.maxHeight` consistently greater than `return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.height`.

3. **Semantic Considerations**:
   - The `maxHeight` parameter is likely intended to filter or limit the size of resources returned, which may include thumbnails.
   - The invariant suggests that the `maxHeight` parameter effectively limits the maximum height of thumbnails returned.

4. **Specification and Logical Consistency**:
   - The specification does not explicitly state that `maxHeight` should be greater than `maxres.height`, but it is a plausible interpretation of the parameter's purpose.
   - The invariant aligns with the logical expectation that a filtering parameter (`maxHeight`) would set an upper bound on the size of returned resources.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic context of the `maxHeight` parameter as a filtering constraint and the consistent empirical evidence from the examples, the invariant appears to be a reasonable and logical constraint. The lack of counterexamples across 100 calls further supports its validity.

**Verdict**: `true-positive`

**Confidence**: 0.85 (High confidence due to logical consistency and empirical support, but acknowledging the optional nature of `maxres.height` which could theoretically allow for exceptions.)

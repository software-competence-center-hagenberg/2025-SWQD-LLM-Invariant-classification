### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameters**:
  - `maxWidth`: An optional query parameter of type integer, with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192.
- **Response**:
  - The response is an object containing an array of `items`.
  - Each item has a `snippet` object, which includes a `thumbnails` object.
  - The `thumbnails` object has a `standard` property, which itself is an object containing a `width` property of type integer.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxWidth > return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width`
- **Invariant Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan`
- **Description**: This invariant suggests that the `maxWidth` input parameter is always greater than the `width` of the `standard` thumbnail in the response.

### Analysis

- **Parameter `maxWidth`**: The parameter is intended to specify the maximum width for the player, not directly for thumbnails. However, it is reasonable to assume that if a maximum width is specified for the player, the thumbnails might also adhere to this constraint, although this is not explicitly stated in the Swagger definition.
- **Response `width`**: The `width` of the `standard` thumbnail is optional and not explicitly constrained by the `maxWidth` parameter according to the Swagger definition.
- **Examples and Calls**: Out of 100 calls, no counterexamples were found, and 7 distinct examples supported the invariant. The examples show that `input.maxWidth` is consistently greater than `return.items.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width`.

### Conclusion

The invariant `input.maxWidth > return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width` seems to hold true based on the examples provided. However, the Swagger definition does not explicitly link the `maxWidth` parameter to the thumbnail width. The invariant might be a result of the current implementation or data set rather than a guaranteed rule. Given the lack of explicit specification support and the potential for different thumbnail sizes not covered by the current examples, the invariant is likely a **false-positive**.

**Confidence**: 0.7 (Moderately confident due to lack of explicit specification support and potential variability in thumbnail sizes)

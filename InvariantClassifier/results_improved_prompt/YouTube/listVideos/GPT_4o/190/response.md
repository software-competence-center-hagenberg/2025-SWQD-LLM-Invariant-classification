### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a `snippet` and `contentDetails` object. The `snippet` object includes a `thumbnails` property, which has a `standard` thumbnail with an optional `width`. The `contentDetails` object includes a `regionRestriction` property, which is deprecated and contains a `blocked` array of region codes where the video is not viewable.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`

This invariant suggests that the width of the standard thumbnail is greater than the number of blocked regions for a video.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `width` of a thumbnail is a numeric value representing the pixel width of an image.
   - The `blocked` array contains region codes, and its `size` represents the number of regions where the video is blocked.
   - There is no direct semantic relationship between the width of a thumbnail and the number of blocked regions. These are two independent attributes of a video.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found.
   - There are 371 examples supporting the invariant, with 24 distinct examples.
   - Example values show a consistent pattern where the width (640) is greater than the number of blocked regions (ranging from 1 to 16 in the examples provided).

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The Swagger definition does not provide any constraints or relationships between the thumbnail width and the number of blocked regions.
   - The invariant seems to be a coincidental pattern rather than a rule enforced by the API's logic or specification.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic relationship between the thumbnail width and the number of blocked regions, and the absence of any specification that enforces such a relationship, this invariant is likely a "false-positive". The empirical evidence suggests a pattern, but without a logical basis, it is not a true invariant of the API.

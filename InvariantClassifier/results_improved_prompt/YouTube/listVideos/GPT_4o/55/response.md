### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of video resources. It accepts a query parameter `id`, which is an array of strings. This parameter is used to filter the videos returned by their unique YouTube IDs. The response contains an object with a property `items`, which is an array of video objects, each having an `id` field representing the unique identifier of the video.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.id in input.id[]`, which suggests that every video ID returned in the response (`return.items.id`) is a member of the list of IDs provided in the request (`input.id`).

### Analysis
1. **Specification Alignment**: The specification indicates that the `id` parameter is used to filter the videos returned. This implies that the response should only include videos whose IDs were specified in the `input.id` array.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there were 5,512 examples supporting the invariant, with 3,443 distinct examples.
3. **Example Consistency**: The provided examples consistently show that the `return.items.id` is indeed one of the IDs specified in `input.id`.

### Conclusion
Given the specification that the `id` parameter filters the videos returned, the empirical evidence from a large number of calls, and the consistency of the examples, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of the API as described in the Swagger definition.

**Confidence**: 0.95

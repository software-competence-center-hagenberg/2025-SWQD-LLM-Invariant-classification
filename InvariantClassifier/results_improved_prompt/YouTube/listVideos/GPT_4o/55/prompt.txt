Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
      - name: id
        in: query
        description: Return videos with the given ids.
        required: false
        type: array
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                id:
                  type: string
                  description: The ID that YouTube uses to uniquely identify the video.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.id in input.id[]

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.sequenceString.MemberString
Invariant description: Represents String scalars that are always members of a sequence of String values. Prints as x in y[] where x is a String scalar and y[] is a sequence of String.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 5512 examples in the requests data, with 3443 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.id=0enJWrc7apE%2CUbkuFychbKM%2CqRBWLhIRUoY%2CKD-iSMNYvf0; return.items.id=qRBWLhIRUoY

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered. The response includes an array of items, each containing `liveStreamingDetails`. Within `liveStreamingDetails`, there is a property `actualEndTime` which is a string representing the time a broadcast actually ended. This value is only available after the broadcast is over.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime)==20`. This invariant suggests that the `actualEndTime` string always has a fixed length of 20 characters.

### Analysis

- **Data Format:** The example values provided for `actualEndTime` are in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`, which is a common representation of timestamps in ISO 8601 format. This format indeed has a fixed length of 20 characters.
- **Number of Calls and Examples:** The invariant was tested over 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, and 480 distinct examples were observed, all adhering to the 20-character length.
- **Specification Consistency:** The swagger definition does not specify any other format for `actualEndTime`, nor does it suggest variability in the length of this string. The description implies that this field is a timestamp, which typically adheres to a standard format.

### Conclusion

Given the consistent format of timestamps, the lack of counterexamples in a large number of calls, and the absence of any conflicting information in the swagger definition, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the expected format for timestamps, and the extensive testing supports its validity.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered. The response schema includes an `items` array, where each item has a `contentDetails` object. Within `contentDetails`, there is a `dimension` property, which is a string indicating whether the video is available in 3D or 2D.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.contentDetails.dimension)==2`, which suggests that the `dimension` property always has a fixed length of 2 characters.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Description**: The `dimension` property is described as indicating whether the video is available in 3D or 2D. The examples provided (`3d` and `2d`) both have a length of 2 characters, which aligns with the invariant.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample. Additionally, 28,274 examples were observed, with only 2 distinct values (`3d` and `2d`), both of which conform to the invariant.

3. **Semantic Context**: The `dimension` property is semantically expected to represent a binary state (2D or 3D), which naturally fits into a 2-character string format (`2d` or `3d`).

4. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not mention any other possible values for `dimension` beyond 2D or 3D, nor does it suggest any other format that would contradict the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic context, the empirical evidence from a large number of calls, and the lack of any specification details that contradict the invariant, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant `LENGTH(return.contentDetails.dimension)==2` is a "true-positive". The invariant is consistent with the expected values of the `dimension` property and is supported by the data.

**Confidence**: 0.95

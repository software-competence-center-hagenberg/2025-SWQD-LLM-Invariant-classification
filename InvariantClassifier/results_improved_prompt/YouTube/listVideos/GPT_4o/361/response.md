### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema includes an array of `items`, each containing `contentDetails` and `snippet` objects. 

- `contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked`: This is an array of strings representing region codes where the video is blocked. The documentation notes that if this property is present and contains an empty list, the video is viewable in all countries.
- `snippet.tags`: This is an array of strings representing keyword tags associated with the video.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) != size(return.snippet.tags[])`

This invariant asserts that the number of blocked regions is not equal to the number of tags for a video.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `blocked` array and the `tags` array serve entirely different purposes. The `blocked` array is related to geographical restrictions, while the `tags` array is related to video metadata for search and categorization.
   - There is no inherent reason why the number of blocked regions should correlate with the number of tags. These are independent attributes.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, suggesting a strong empirical basis for the invariant.
   - 384 examples were found, with 65 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The specification does not suggest any relationship between the number of blocked regions and the number of tags. The invariant does not contradict the specification but is not supported by it either.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic independence of the two fields and the lack of any specification suggesting a relationship between them, the invariant appears to be a "false-positive". The empirical evidence is strong, but the invariant lacks a logical basis in the API's design or documentation. Therefore, despite the empirical data, the invariant is likely coincidental rather than a true invariant of the API.

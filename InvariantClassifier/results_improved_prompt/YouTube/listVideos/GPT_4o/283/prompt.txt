Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                liveStreamingDetails:
                  type: object
                  description: Details about the live streaming metadata.
                  properties:
                    activeLiveChatId:
                      type: string
                      description: The ID of the currently active live chat attached to this video. This field is filled only if the video is a currently live broadcast that has live chat. Once the broadcast transitions to complete this field will be removed and the live chat closed down. For persistent broadcasts that live chat id will no longer be tied to this video but rather to the new video being displayed at the persistent page.
              items:
                topicDetails:
                  type: object
                  description: Freebase topic information related to the video.
                  properties:
                    topicCategories:
                      type: array
                      description: A list of Wikipedia URLs that provide a high-level description of the video's content.
                      items:
                        type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.liveStreamingDetails.activeLiveChatId in return.topicDetails.topicCategories[]

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.sequenceString.MemberString
Invariant description: Represents String scalars that are always members of a sequence of String values. Prints as x in y[] where x is a String scalar and y[] is a sequence of String.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 500 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube video resources. The relevant parts of the response schema include:

- **contentDetails**: Contains details about the content of a YouTube video, including a deprecated field `regionRestriction`.
  - **regionRestriction**: An object that may contain a `blocked` property, which is an array of strings representing region codes where the video is blocked.

- **liveStreamingDetails**: Contains metadata about live streaming, including `actualEndTime`, which is a string representing the time a broadcast actually ended.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`

This invariant suggests that the `actualEndTime` of a live stream is always a member of the `blocked` array of region codes.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - **actualEndTime**: This is a timestamp indicating when a live broadcast ended. It is a temporal value and not related to geographical regions.
   - **blocked**: This is a list of region codes indicating where the video is not viewable. It is a geographical restriction and not related to time.

2. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The invariant suggests a relationship between a timestamp and a list of region codes, which are semantically unrelated. It is illogical for a timestamp to be a member of a list of region codes.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - Despite 100 calls without a counterexample, the semantic mismatch strongly suggests that the invariant is coincidental rather than meaningful.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic mismatch between `actualEndTime` (a timestamp) and `blocked` (a list of region codes), the invariant is logically inconsistent. The lack of counterexamples in 100 calls is likely due to the specific data returned in those calls rather than a true relationship. Therefore, this invariant is a **false-positive**.

**Confidence**: 0.95

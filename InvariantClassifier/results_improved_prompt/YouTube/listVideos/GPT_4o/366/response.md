### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameters**:
  - `maxWidth`: An optional query parameter of type integer, with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192.
- **Response**:
  - `pageInfo`: Contains `totalResults`, an integer representing the total number of results in the result set.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxWidth != return.pageInfo.totalResults`
- **Invariant Type**: Represents an invariant of inequality (`!=`) between two integer values.

### Analysis

1. **Parameter and Response Context**:
   - `input.maxWidth` is a query parameter that specifies the maximum width for a player, which is unrelated to the number of results returned.
   - `return.pageInfo.totalResults` indicates the total number of results in the result set, which is a count of resources, not related to the dimensions of a player.

2. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The two fields compared in the invariant serve entirely different purposes. `maxWidth` is related to display dimensions, while `totalResults` is related to the quantity of data returned.
   - There is no logical or semantic reason for these two values to be equal or related.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant held true across 10,000 calls with no counterexamples found.
   - The distinct examples provided show a consistent pattern where `maxWidth` and `totalResults` are unrelated and thus naturally unequal.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic irrelevance between `maxWidth` and `totalResults`, and the empirical evidence from 10,000 calls without a counterexample, the invariant `input.maxWidth != return.pageInfo.totalResults` is a **true-positive**. The invariant is likely to hold due to the unrelated nature of the two fields, rather than a coincidental pattern.

### Confidence

The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear semantic distinction and the large number of calls tested without a counterexample.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of video resources. The request requires a `part` parameter, which is a comma-separated list of video resource properties to include in the response. The response includes an `items` array, where each item can have a `snippet` object containing video details, including `thumbnails`. The `medium` thumbnail has an optional `height` property.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.height % size(input.part[]) == 0`.
- This invariant suggests that the height of the medium thumbnail divides evenly by the number of parts specified in the `part` parameter.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Relevance**: The `part` parameter specifies which properties of the video resource are included in the response. It is not directly related to the dimensions of the thumbnail images. The thumbnail height is a property of the video resource itself and is unlikely to be influenced by the number of parts requested.
2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not mention any relationship between the `part` parameter and the thumbnail dimensions. The `part` parameter is used to filter the response properties, not to alter the content of those properties.
3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held true for 50 calls, with 13 distinct examples. However, the lack of a semantic connection between the `part` parameter and the thumbnail height suggests that the observed invariant is coincidental rather than a true relationship.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of semantic connection between the `part` parameter and the thumbnail height, and the absence of any specification indicating such a relationship, this invariant is likely a "false-positive". The invariant holding true in the tested examples is likely coincidental, and it is improbable that it will hold for all possible valid requests.

**Confidence**: 0.8

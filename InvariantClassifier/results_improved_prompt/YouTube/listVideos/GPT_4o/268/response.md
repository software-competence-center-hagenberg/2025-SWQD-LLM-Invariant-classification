### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes a REST API endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered. The response schema includes an array of `items`, each containing a `player` object. The `player` object has two properties:

- `embedHeight`: A string representing the height of the embedded player.
- `embedHtml`: A string containing an `<iframe>` tag that embeds a player for video playback.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.player.embedHeight` is a substring of `return.player.embedHtml`.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `embedHtml` field is described as containing an `<iframe>` tag, which typically includes attributes such as `width`, `height`, `src`, etc.
   - The `embedHeight` is likely to be a string representation of the height attribute within the `<iframe>` tag.
   - It is reasonable to expect that the `embedHeight` value would appear as part of the `height` attribute in the `embedHtml` string.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found.
   - There were 21,277 examples supporting the invariant, with 17,881 distinct examples.

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The specification does not explicitly mention any other format or structure for `embedHtml` that would contradict the invariant.
   - The invariant aligns with typical HTML structure for embedding players, where the height attribute would include the `embedHeight` value.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic alignment between the `embedHeight` and its expected presence in the `embedHtml` string, combined with the extensive empirical evidence supporting the invariant, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The lack of counterexamples across a large number of calls further strengthens this conclusion.

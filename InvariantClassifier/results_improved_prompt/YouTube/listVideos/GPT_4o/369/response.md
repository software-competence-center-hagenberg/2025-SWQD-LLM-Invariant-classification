### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `id`: An optional query parameter that is an array of video IDs.
- **Response**:
  - Contains a `pageInfo` object with a `totalResults` property indicating the total number of results in the result set.

### Invariant
- **Invariant**: `return.pageInfo.totalResults <= size(input.id[])`
- **Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntLessEqual`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `<=` between two long scalars.

### Analysis
- **Request Parameter**: `input.id[]` is an array of video IDs. The size of this array represents the number of IDs provided in the request.
- **Response Field**: `return.pageInfo.totalResults` indicates the total number of results returned.
- **Invariant Interpretation**: The invariant suggests that the total number of results returned (`totalResults`) is always less than or equal to the number of IDs provided in the request.
- **Empirical Evidence**: 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample, and 1,263 distinct examples were observed.

### Conclusion
- **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant makes logical sense because when querying with specific IDs, the number of results returned should not exceed the number of IDs requested. Each ID corresponds to at most one video, so the total results should be less than or equal to the number of IDs.
- **Empirical Support**: The large number of calls and distinct examples without a counterexample strongly supports the invariant.

Given the logical consistency of the invariant with the API's functionality and the empirical evidence, this invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

### Confidence
- **Confidence Level**: 0.95 (Very high confidence due to logical consistency and empirical support)

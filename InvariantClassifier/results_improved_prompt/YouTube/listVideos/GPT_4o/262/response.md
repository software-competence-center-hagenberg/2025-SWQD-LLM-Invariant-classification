### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` that retrieves a list of video resources. The response includes an array of items, each with an `id` (a string uniquely identifying the video) and a `player` object containing an `embedHtml` string, which is an `<iframe>` tag for embedding the video player.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is that `return.id` is a substring of `return.player.embedHtml`. This suggests that the unique video ID appears somewhere within the HTML string used to embed the video player.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Plausibility**: It is semantically plausible that the video ID would appear in the `embedHtml` string. Typically, when embedding a video, the ID is included in the URL within the `<iframe>` tag to specify which video to play.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 27,871 examples supporting the invariant, with 19,874 being distinct. This large number of examples without any counterexamples strongly suggests that the invariant holds.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not explicitly contradict the invariant. The description of `embedHtml` as an `<iframe>` tag aligns with the common practice of including the video ID in such tags.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic plausibility, the large number of supporting examples, and the lack of counterexamples, the invariant that `return.id` is a substring of `return.player.embedHtml` is likely a "true-positive". The evidence strongly supports that this invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of resources, potentially filtered. The response schema includes an `items` array, where each item can have a `fileDetails` object. This object contains a `videoStreams` array, which holds metadata about video streams, including properties like `aspectRatio`, `bitrateBps`, `codec`, `frameRateFps`, `heightPixels`, `rotation`, `vendor`, and `widthPixels`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.fileDetails.videoStreams == null`. This suggests that for every response received, the `videoStreams` property within `fileDetails` is always `null`.

### Analysis

1. **Number of Calls**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, which is a significant number. The absence of counterexamples in such a large sample size suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not explicitly state that `videoStreams` must be non-null. It describes `videoStreams` as a list of video streams, implying that it could potentially be empty or null if no video streams are available or applicable.

3. **Semantic Context**: The `videoStreams` property is meant to describe video stream metadata. If no video streams exist for a given video resource, it is reasonable for this property to be null.

4. **Potential Scenarios**: There could be scenarios where videos do not have associated video streams, such as metadata-only entries or placeholder videos, which would justify a null `videoStreams`.

### Conclusion

Given the large number of calls without counterexamples and the reasonable interpretation of the `videoStreams` property being null in certain scenarios, the invariant is likely a "true-positive". The specification does not contradict this possibility, and the semantic context supports it.

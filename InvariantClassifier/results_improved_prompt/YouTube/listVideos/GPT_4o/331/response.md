### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameter**: `maxWidth` (query parameter)
  - Type: integer
  - Minimum: 72
  - Maximum length: 8192 (though this seems like a typo and should be maximum value)
- **Response**: 200 OK
  - **Schema**: Object
    - **Items**: Array
      - **Snippet**: Object
        - **Thumbnails**: Object
          - **Standard**: Object
            - **Width**: Integer

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxWidth != return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width`
- **Invariant Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `!=` between two long scalars.

### Analysis

1. **Parameter and Response Field**:
   - `input.maxWidth` is a query parameter that specifies the maximum width for the player.
   - `return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width` is a field in the response that specifies the width of a standard thumbnail image.

2. **Semantic Relationship**:
   - There is no direct semantic relationship between `maxWidth` (a parameter for player width) and `thumbnails.standard.width` (a property of a thumbnail image). These two values serve different purposes and are not inherently related.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 10,000 API calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 1,008 examples were found, with 786 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.
   - Example values show a consistent pattern where `maxWidth` is significantly different from `thumbnails.standard.width`.

4. **Specification and Context**:
   - The specification does not suggest any relationship between the `maxWidth` parameter and the thumbnail width in the response.
   - The invariant seems to hold due to the lack of a logical connection between the two fields rather than a rule enforced by the API.

### Conclusion

The invariant `input.maxWidth != return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width` is likely a **true-positive** because:
- There is no logical or specified relationship between the `maxWidth` parameter and the thumbnail width.
- The empirical evidence strongly supports the invariant with no counterexamples found in a large number of trials.
- The invariant is likely a result of the independent nature of these fields rather than an enforced rule.

Given the lack of semantic connection and the empirical evidence, the confidence in this classification is high.

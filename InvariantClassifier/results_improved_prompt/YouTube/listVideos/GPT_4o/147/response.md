### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is designed to retrieve a list of video resources, potentially filtered by the query parameter `part`. This parameter is required and specifies which video resource properties should be included in the API response. The response schema includes an array of items, each potentially containing a `snippet` object with a `thumbnails` object. The `thumbnails` object can have a `default` property, which includes a `width` property that is an integer.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width % size(input.part[]) == 0`

This invariant suggests that the width of the default thumbnail image divides evenly by the number of elements in the `part` array from the request.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Relevance**: The `part` parameter is a list of properties to include in the response, while `width` is a property of a thumbnail image. There is no semantic connection between the number of properties requested and the width of a thumbnail.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not suggest any relationship between the number of parts requested and the thumbnail width. The `part` parameter is used to filter the response properties, and the thumbnail width is a static property of the video resource.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held for all 50 calls, with 13 distinct examples. However, the lack of a semantic relationship and specification support suggests that this is likely coincidental.

4. **Example Analysis**: All examples provided show a `width` of 120, which is a common thumbnail width. The `part` parameter varies, but the width remains constant, indicating no causal relationship.

### Conclusion

The invariant is likely a "false-positive" due to the lack of semantic connection between the `part` parameter and the thumbnail `width`. The invariant holding in the examples is likely coincidental, as the width of a thumbnail is not expected to change based on the number of requested properties.

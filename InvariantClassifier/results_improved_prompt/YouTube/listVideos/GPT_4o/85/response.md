### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameter**: `maxWidth` (query parameter)
  - Type: integer
  - Minimum: 72
  - Maximum length: 8192 (though this seems to be a mistake, as maxLength is not applicable to integers)
- **Response**: 200 OK
  - **Schema**: Object
    - **Properties**:
      - `items`: Array
        - **Properties**:
          - `snippet`: Object
            - **Properties**:
              - `thumbnails`: Object
                - **Properties**:
                  - `default`: Object
                    - **Properties**:
                      - `height`: Integer (Optional)

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxWidth > return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height`
- **Type**: Binary scalar invariant representing `>` relationship between `maxWidth` and `height`.

### Analysis

1. **Parameter and Response Context**:
   - `maxWidth` is a query parameter that specifies the maximum width for a player.
   - `return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height` is an optional property representing the height of a thumbnail image.

2. **Semantic Relationship**:
   - The invariant suggests that the `maxWidth` parameter is always greater than the `height` of the default thumbnail returned.
   - There is no direct semantic relationship between the width of a player and the height of a thumbnail, as they pertain to different dimensions and purposes.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 12 examples were found, with 7 distinct, all supporting the invariant.
   - Example values consistently show `input.maxWidth` significantly greater than `return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height`.

4. **Specification and Logical Consistency**:
   - The specification does not explicitly state any relationship between `maxWidth` and `thumbnail height`.
   - The invariant may hold due to typical configurations where `maxWidth` is set to a large value compared to typical thumbnail heights.

### Conclusion

The invariant `input.maxWidth > return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height` appears to be a "false-positive" due to the lack of a logical or semantic relationship between the two fields. The invariant holds in the tested examples likely due to typical usage patterns rather than a guaranteed rule enforced by the API. The specification does not imply any such relationship, and the invariant's validity is coincidental rather than intentional.

**Confidence**: 0.7

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition describes an endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` which retrieves a list of resources. The response includes an array of items, each containing `liveStreamingDetails` with a property `actualEndTime`. This property is described as a string representing the time the broadcast actually ended, and it is only available once the broadcast is over.

### Invariant
The invariant in question states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime` is always a timestamp in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmZ`, with milliseconds being optional.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Specification**: The swagger definition specifies that `actualEndTime` is a string representing a time, which aligns with the invariant's claim that it is a timestamp.
2. **Data Analysis**: With 10,000 API calls, no counterexamples were found, and 480 distinct examples were observed, all adhering to the specified timestamp format. This suggests a strong pattern of consistency.
3. **Example Values**: The provided example values all conform to the timestamp format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`, which is consistent with the invariant.
4. **Specification Consistency**: The swagger definition does not specify any alternative formats or values for `actualEndTime`, suggesting that the invariant is not contradicted by the specification.

### Conclusion
Given the large number of calls (10,000) and the absence of counterexamples, along with the alignment of the invariant with the swagger definition and the example values, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant correctly describes the format of `actualEndTime` as observed in the API responses.

### Confidence
The confidence in this classification is high due to the extensive data supporting the invariant and the lack of any specification contradictions.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is designed to retrieve a list of resources, potentially filtered by certain parameters. The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a `liveStreamingDetails` object. Within this object, the `scheduledEndTime` property is described as a string that indicates the time a broadcast is scheduled to end. The description specifies that if this value is empty or not present, the broadcast is scheduled to continue indefinitely.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime` is always a timestamp in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmZ`, where milliseconds are optional.

### Analysis
1. **Format Specification**: The invariant specifies a format for `scheduledEndTime` that aligns with common timestamp formats used in APIs, particularly ISO 8601. The format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmZ` is a standard representation for timestamps, which includes date, time, and timezone information.

2. **Swagger Description**: The swagger description does not explicitly state the format of `scheduledEndTime`, but it is reasonable to assume a standard timestamp format given the context of scheduling and time representation.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 API calls without encountering a counterexample. Additionally, 47 examples were found, with 7 distinct examples, all adhering to the specified timestamp format.

4. **Potential for Variability**: The swagger description mentions that the `scheduledEndTime` can be empty or absent, which introduces a potential variability. However, the invariant does not claim that the field is always present, only that when it is present, it follows the specified format.

### Conclusion
Given the extensive testing (10,000 calls) without any counterexamples and the reasonable assumption that a timestamp field would follow a standard format, the invariant is likely a "true-positive". The potential for the field to be empty or absent does not contradict the invariant, as it only asserts the format when the field is present.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of video resources. One of the query parameters is `maxWidth`, which is an optional integer with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192. The response includes an array of items, each containing a `snippet` object with a `tags` array. Each tag is a string and can contain spaces.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `input.maxWidth > size(return.snippet.tags[])`. This invariant suggests that the `maxWidth` parameter in the request is always greater than the number of tags in the `tags` array of the response.

### Analysis

1. **Parameter and Response Context**:
   - `maxWidth` is related to the player dimensions, not directly to the number of tags.
   - `tags` are keywords associated with the video and can vary in number independently of `maxWidth`.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 8,981 examples were found, with 7,346 distinct examples.
   - Example values show `maxWidth` values significantly larger than the number of tags, but this is not inherently guaranteed by the API's logic or specification.

3. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - There is no semantic relationship between `maxWidth` (a dimension parameter) and the number of tags (metadata about the video).
   - The invariant seems coincidental based on the data sampled rather than a logical constraint imposed by the API.

### Conclusion

The invariant `input.maxWidth > size(return.snippet.tags[])` is likely a "false-positive" because:
- There is no logical or semantic reason why the `maxWidth` should always be greater than the number of tags.
- The API specification does not imply any relationship between these two fields.
- The invariant appears to be an artifact of the specific data sampled rather than a true constraint of the API.

**Confidence**: 0.9, due to the lack of semantic connection and specification support for the invariant.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameters**:
  - `maxWidth`: An optional query parameter of type integer with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192.
- **Response**:
  - The response is an object containing an array of `items`, each having a `snippet` object.
  - The `snippet` object includes a `thumbnails` object, which has a `medium` thumbnail with a `width` property.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxWidth > return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.width`
- **Invariant Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `>` between two long scalars.

### Analysis

1. **Parameter and Response Context**:
   - `input.maxWidth` is a query parameter that specifies the maximum width for the player.
   - `return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.width` is the width of the medium thumbnail in the response.

2. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `maxWidth` parameter is intended to limit the width of the player, not specifically the thumbnail width. However, it is reasonable to assume that the player width could be greater than the thumbnail width, as thumbnails are typically smaller representations of the video.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 12 examples were found, with 7 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.
   - Example values consistently show `input.maxWidth` being greater than `return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.width`.

4. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The specification does not explicitly state a relationship between `maxWidth` and the thumbnail width, but the observed data supports the invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic reasoning that thumbnails are typically smaller than the player, the lack of counterexamples in 100 calls, and the consistent empirical evidence, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a "true-positive". However, the confidence is not absolute due to the lack of explicit specification support.

- **Verdict**: true-positive
- **Confidence**: 0.8

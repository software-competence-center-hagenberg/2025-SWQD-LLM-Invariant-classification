### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered. The response schema includes an array of items, each with a `status` object. This `status` object contains two boolean properties:
- `madeForKids`: This property indicates whether a video is made for kids.
- `selfDeclaredMadeForKids`: This property indicates whether the video is self-declared as made for kids.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:
```
return.status.madeForKids == return.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids
```
This invariant suggests that the `madeForKids` status is always equal to the `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` status for each video.

### Analysis

1. **Number of Calls and Examples:**
   - The invariant was tested over 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample.
   - There are 46 examples supporting the invariant, with 2 distinct examples showing both `true` and `false` values for the properties.

2. **Semantic Analysis:**
   - The `madeForKids` property likely represents an official status determined by YouTube, while `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` suggests a status declared by the uploader.
   - It is plausible that these two statuses could differ, as a video might be self-declared as made for kids but not officially recognized as such by YouTube, or vice versa.

3. **Specification and Context:**
   - The specification does not explicitly state that these two properties must always be equal. The presence of both properties suggests they might serve different purposes or reflect different sources of truth.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic difference between the two properties and the lack of explicit specification that they must always be equal, the invariant is likely a "false-positive". The fact that no counterexamples were found could be due to the specific dataset or conditions under which the API was tested, rather than a true invariant.

**Confidence:** 0.7

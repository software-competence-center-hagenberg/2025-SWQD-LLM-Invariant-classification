### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Operation**: `GET`
- **Parameter**: `maxWidth`
  - **Type**: Integer
  - **Minimum**: 72
  - **Maximum Length**: 8192 (although this seems to be a mistake in the description, as `maxLength` is not applicable to integers)
- **Response**: Contains `pageInfo` with `totalResults` as an integer indicating the total number of results.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxWidth > return.pageInfo.totalResults`
- **Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `>` between two long scalars.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - `input.maxWidth` is a query parameter that seems to relate to the dimensions of a player, specifically its width.
   - `return.pageInfo.totalResults` represents the total number of results available in the result set.
   - Semantically, there is no direct relationship between the maximum width of a player and the total number of results in a video list. These two values are conceptually unrelated.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 76 examples were found with 48 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.
   - Example values show `input.maxWidth` consistently greater than `return.pageInfo.totalResults`.

3. **Specification Analysis**:
   - The specification does not provide any direct correlation between `maxWidth` and `totalResults`.
   - The invariant seems to be coincidental based on the data observed rather than a rule enforced by the API design.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic irrelevance between `maxWidth` and `totalResults`, and the lack of specification support for such a relationship, the invariant is likely a coincidental finding rather than a true invariant of the API. The invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the semantic analysis and the lack of specification support for the invariant.

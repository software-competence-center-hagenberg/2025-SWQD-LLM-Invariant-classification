Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                liveStreamingDetails:
                  type: object
                  description: Details about the live streaming metadata.
                  properties:
                    actualStartTime:
                      type: string
                      description: The time that the broadcast actually started. This value will not be available until the broadcast begins.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.liveStreamingDetails.actualStartTime is Timestamp. Format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmZ (Miliseconds are optional)

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.dates.IsTimestampYYYYMMHHThhmmssmm
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable is always a timestamp. Represented as x is Timestamp. Format
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 3186 examples in the requests data, with 473 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.items.liveStreamingDetails.actualStartTime=2022-10-03T19:03:03Z
return.items.liveStreamingDetails.actualStartTime=2022-10-01T06:30:43Z
return.items.liveStreamingDetails.actualStartTime=2022-09-30T19:11:20Z
return.items.liveStreamingDetails.actualStartTime=2022-10-05T21:15:12Z
return.items.liveStreamingDetails.actualStartTime=2022-10-05T05:30:08Z

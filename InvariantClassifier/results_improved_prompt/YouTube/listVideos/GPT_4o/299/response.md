### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of video resources, potentially filtered by certain parameters. The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a `snippet` and `contentDetails` object. The `snippet` object includes a `thumbnails` object, which further contains a `standard` thumbnail with an optional `height` property. The `contentDetails` object includes a `regionRestriction` object, which has a `blocked` property. This `blocked` property is an array of strings representing region codes where the video is blocked.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.height % size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) == 0`

This invariant suggests that the height of the standard thumbnail divides evenly by the number of regions in which the video is blocked.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Relevance**: The invariant compares the height of a thumbnail image with the number of blocked regions. These two properties are semantically unrelated. The height of an image is a visual property, while the number of blocked regions is a geographical restriction.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not suggest any relationship between the thumbnail height and the number of blocked regions. The `height` is optional and may not always be present, and the `blocked` list can vary independently of the thumbnail properties.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held true in 100 calls, with 4 distinct examples showing the invariant holding. However, the lack of counterexamples does not necessarily imply a true relationship, especially given the semantic irrelevance.

### Conclusion

The invariant is likely a "false-positive" due to the lack of semantic connection between the thumbnail height and the number of blocked regions. The empirical evidence is not strong enough to override the semantic analysis, especially given the optional nature of the `height` property and the deprecated status of `regionRestriction`. The invariant appears coincidental rather than indicative of a true relationship.

**Confidence**: 0.7

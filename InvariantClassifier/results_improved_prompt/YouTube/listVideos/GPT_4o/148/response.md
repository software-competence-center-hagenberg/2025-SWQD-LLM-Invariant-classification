### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of video resources. The request requires a `part` parameter, which is a comma-separated list of video resource properties that the API response will include. The response contains an `items` array, where each item has a `snippet` object. The `snippet` object includes a `thumbnails` object, which has a `default` thumbnail with a `width` property.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width > size(input.part[])`. This invariant suggests that the width of the default thumbnail in the response is greater than the number of parts specified in the input query parameter.

### Analysis
1. **Request Parameter (`input.part`)**: This is a list of video resource properties. The size of this list is the number of properties requested.
2. **Response Field (`return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width`)**: This is the width of the default thumbnail image for a video resource.
3. **Invariant Logic**: The invariant claims that the width of the thumbnail is always greater than the number of parts requested.

Given the examples provided:
- `input.part=contentDetails%2Cplayer%2Csnippet%2Cid` results in `return.items.snippet.thumbnails.default.width=120`
- `input.part=contentDetails%2Csnippet%2Cstatistics%2CtopicDetails` results in `return.items.snippet.thumbnails.default.width=120`

In both examples, the width (120) is greater than the number of parts (4 and 5 respectively).

### Conclusion
The invariant seems to hold true for all tested cases (10000 calls), and there is no explicit contradiction in the Swagger definition that suggests the width of a thumbnail is related to the number of parts requested. However, the relationship between the thumbnail width and the number of parts requested is not semantically obvious. The width of a thumbnail is typically a fixed property of the video resource, unrelated to the number of parts requested.

Given the lack of semantic connection and the fact that the invariant is not explicitly supported by the API specification, it is likely a coincidence that the invariant holds for the tested cases. Therefore, it is classified as a "false-positive".

**Confidence**: 0.7, due to the lack of semantic connection and the invariant not being explicitly supported by the API specification.

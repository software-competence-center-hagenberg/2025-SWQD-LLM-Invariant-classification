### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` that retrieves a list of video resources. The response includes an array of items, each containing a `snippet` object. This `snippet` object includes a `thumbnails` object, which further contains a `default` thumbnail object. The `default` thumbnail object has a `width` property, which is an integer and is described as optional.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

- `return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width == 120`

This invariant suggests that the `width` of the `default` thumbnail is always 120.

### Analysis

1. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

2. **Distinct Examples**: Out of 27,720 examples, only one distinct value was observed, which is 120. This further supports the invariant.

3. **Specification Details**: The Swagger specification describes the `width` as an optional integer. It does not specify any particular value or range for the `width`. However, the lack of specification does not contradict the invariant.

4. **Semantic Consideration**: The `width` of a thumbnail is a property that could vary depending on the video resource or the API's implementation details. However, the consistent observation of the value 120 suggests a default or standard size used by the API.

### Conclusion

Given the extensive empirical evidence and the lack of contradiction in the specification, the invariant `return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width == 120` is likely a "true-positive". The API might be designed to return thumbnails of a standard width of 120, or it might be a default value when no other size is specified.

**Verdict**: True-positive

**Confidence**: 0.95

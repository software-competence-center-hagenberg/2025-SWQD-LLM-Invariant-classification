Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                snippet:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video, including title, description, uploader, thumbnails and category.
                  properties:
                    tags:

                      items:
                        type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: size(return.snippet.tags[]) >= 1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.LowerBound
Invariant description: Represents the invariant x >= c, where c is a constant and x is a long scalar.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 20349 examples in the requests data, with 2362 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.items.snippet.tags=["konbini","kombini"]
return.items.snippet.tags=["record","rede record","record tv","hora do faro","faro","rodrigo faro","record faro"]
return.items.snippet.tags=["oceane","océane","océane les anges","oce.rthn","oce"]

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of video resources. The response includes an array of `items`, each containing a `snippet` object. The `snippet` object has a `tags` property, which is an array of strings representing keyword tags associated with the video.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `size(return.snippet.tags[]) >= 1`, which suggests that every video resource returned by the API has at least one tag in its `tags` array.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Specification**: The specification describes `tags` as "A list of keyword tags associated with the video." There is no explicit mention that the `tags` array must always have at least one tag.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 20,349 examples were collected, with 2,362 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.

3. **Semantic Consideration**: Tags are typically used for categorization and search optimization. It is plausible that a video might not have any tags, especially if it is newly uploaded or if the uploader chose not to add any tags. However, the absence of any counterexamples in a large sample size suggests that, in practice, videos tend to have at least one tag.

4. **Potential for False Positives**: While the invariant holds in all tested cases, the specification does not explicitly enforce this rule. Therefore, there is a possibility that videos without tags could exist, but they were not encountered in the sample.

### Conclusion
Given the large number of examples and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant appears to be a "true-positive" in practice. However, due to the lack of explicit specification enforcing this rule, there is a slight possibility of encountering a video without tags in different circumstances.

**Verdict**: True-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of video resources, possibly filtered by the `part` query parameter. The `part` parameter is required and specifies which properties of the video resource should be included in the response. The response includes an array of items, each with a `contentDetails` object. Within `contentDetails`, there is a `regionRestriction` object, which contains a `blocked` array listing region codes where the video is blocked.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

```
size(input.part[]) != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])-1
```

This invariant suggests that the number of parts specified in the `input.part` array is not equal to the size of the `blocked` array in the `regionRestriction` minus one.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `input.part` parameter is a list of video resource properties that the client wants to retrieve. This is unrelated to the `regionRestriction.blocked` array, which specifies regions where the video is blocked.
   - There is no logical or semantic connection between the number of parts requested and the number of regions where a video is blocked. The two are independent aspects of the API.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 50 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, the lack of counterexamples in a small sample size does not necessarily imply a true relationship.
   - The invariant was observed in 8 distinct examples, but this is a small sample size and does not provide strong evidence of a true invariant.

3. **Specification Review**:
   - The specification does not suggest any relationship between the `part` parameter and the `regionRestriction.blocked` array.
   - The `regionRestriction.blocked` array is marked as deprecated, which might mean it is not consistently populated or used.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic connection between the `input.part` and `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked`, and the small sample size, this invariant is likely a coincidence rather than a true relationship. The invariant is classified as a "false-positive" because it does not hold for every valid request on the API based on logical reasoning and the specification.

**Confidence**: 0.8

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered. The response schema includes an `items` array, where each item has a `contentDetails` object. Within `contentDetails`, there is a `regionRestriction` object that contains an `allowed` property. This `allowed` property is an array of strings, each representing a region code where the video is viewable.

The `regionRestriction` is marked as DEPRECATED, indicating that it might not be actively used or updated in the future.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]) one of { 80, 94 }`

This invariant suggests that the `allowed` array, when present, only has a size of either 80 or 94.

### Analysis

1. **Data Points:** The invariant is based on 50 calls, with 2 distinct examples found, and no counterexamples.
2. **Swagger Specification:** The specification does not explicitly limit the size of the `allowed` array to 80 or 94. It only describes the `allowed` array as a list of region codes.
3. **Semantic Analysis:** The `allowed` array is meant to list region codes where a video is viewable. The size of this array could logically vary depending on the number of regions where the video is allowed. There is no inherent reason why it should be limited to exactly 80 or 94 regions.
4. **DEPRECATED Status:** The DEPRECATED status of `regionRestriction` suggests that it might not be a reliable source for consistent data, and its behavior might not be stable across different API versions or calls.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of specification support for the invariant, the semantic flexibility of the `allowed` array, and the DEPRECATED status of `regionRestriction`, it is unlikely that the invariant holds universally. The invariant seems to be a coincidence based on the limited data set rather than a true characteristic of the API.

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** with moderate confidence.

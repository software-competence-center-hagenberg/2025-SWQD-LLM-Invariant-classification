### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is designed to retrieve a list of video resources. The `part` parameter is crucial as it dictates which properties of the video resource are included in the API response. This parameter is an array and is required. The response schema includes an `items` array, where each item can have a `snippet` object. This `snippet` object contains a `thumbnails` object, which further contains a `high` object with a `width` property.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width % size(input.part[]) == 0`. This implies that the width of the high-resolution thumbnail is divisible by the number of elements in the `part` array without a remainder.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `part` parameter specifies which parts of the video resource are included in the response. It is not directly related to the dimensions of the thumbnails. The `width` of a thumbnail is a property of the video resource itself and should not logically depend on how many parts are requested.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 50 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, only 13 distinct examples were observed, all of which satisfied the invariant.

3. **Specification Review**: The specification does not indicate any relationship between the number of parts requested and the dimensions of the thumbnails. The `part` parameter is more about filtering the response rather than affecting the content of the properties like thumbnail dimensions.

### Conclusion
The invariant suggests a relationship between the number of parts requested and the width of the thumbnail, which does not make semantic sense. The width of a thumbnail is likely a fixed property of the video resource and should not be influenced by the request parameters in this manner. Therefore, despite the lack of counterexamples in the limited testing, the invariant is likely a "false-positive" due to the lack of logical connection between the two variables.

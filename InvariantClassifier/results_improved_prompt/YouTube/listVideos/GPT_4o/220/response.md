### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameter**: `maxWidth`
  - **Type**: integer
  - **Minimum**: 72
  - **Maximum Length**: 8192 (though this seems to be a mistake, as maxLength is not applicable to integers)
- **Response**:
  - **Field**: `pageInfo.resultsPerPage`
  - **Type**: integer
  - **Description**: The number of results included in the API response.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxWidth > return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage`
- **Invariant Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `>` between two long scalars.

### Analysis

1. **Parameter and Response Field Context**:
   - `maxWidth` is a query parameter that seems to relate to the dimensions of a player, possibly affecting the presentation of video resources.
   - `resultsPerPage` is a field in the response indicating how many results are returned per page.

2. **Semantic Relationship**:
   - There is no direct semantic relationship between `maxWidth` and `resultsPerPage`. The former is related to a visual dimension, while the latter is related to pagination.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 5,116 examples were found, with 4,000 distinct examples.
   - Example values consistently show `input.maxWidth` being greater than `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage`.

4. **Specification Consideration**:
   - The specification does not explicitly link `maxWidth` with `resultsPerPage`, nor does it suggest any constraints between these two fields.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic connection between `maxWidth` and `resultsPerPage`, the invariant seems to be coincidental rather than intentional. The empirical evidence is strong, but without a logical basis for the invariant, it is likely a false-positive.

**Verdict**: `false-positive`

**Confidence**: 0.7 (due to strong empirical evidence but lack of logical connection)

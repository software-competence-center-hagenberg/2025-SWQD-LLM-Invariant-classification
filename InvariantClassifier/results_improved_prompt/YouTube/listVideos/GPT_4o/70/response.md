### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Parameter**: `maxHeight` is an optional query parameter of type integer with a minimum value of 72.
- **Response**: The response contains a list of video resources, each having a `contentDetails` object. Within `contentDetails`, there is a `regionRestriction` object that may contain a `blocked` array of strings representing region codes where the video is blocked.

### Invariant
- **Invariant**: `input.maxHeight > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`
- **Type**: Binary invariant comparing two scalar values.
- **Description**: The invariant asserts that the `maxHeight` parameter is greater than the number of blocked regions in the `blocked` array of the response.

### Analysis
- **Parameter and Response Relationship**: The `maxHeight` parameter is related to the query and does not semantically relate to the number of blocked regions in the response. The `maxHeight` parameter is likely intended to filter or limit the size of the video resources in some way, but it is not clear how it would directly influence the `blocked` regions.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, the lack of counterexamples does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between `maxHeight` and the size of the `blocked` array.
- **Logical Consistency**: There is no logical or documented relationship between `maxHeight` and the number of blocked regions. The `blocked` array is related to content restrictions, which are independent of the `maxHeight` parameter.

### Conclusion
The invariant `input.maxHeight > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])` is likely a coincidence rather than a true invariant. The `maxHeight` parameter and the `blocked` array serve different purposes and are not logically connected based on the provided API documentation. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a "false-positive" with high confidence.

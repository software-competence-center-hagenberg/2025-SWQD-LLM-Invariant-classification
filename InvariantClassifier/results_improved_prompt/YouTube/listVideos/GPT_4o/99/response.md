### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema includes an `items` array, where each item can have `contentDetails` and `liveStreamingDetails` objects. 

- **contentDetails**:
  - **regionRestriction**: This is an object that contains an `allowed` array of strings. Each string represents a region code where the video is viewable.

- **liveStreamingDetails**:
  - **actualEndTime**: This is a string representing the time the broadcast actually ended. This field is only available after the broadcast has ended.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]`.

This invariant suggests that the `actualEndTime` of a live stream is always a member of the `allowed` region codes list.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `actualEndTime` is a timestamp indicating when a broadcast ended, while `allowed` is a list of region codes. These two fields are semantically unrelated; a timestamp cannot logically be a member of a list of region codes.

2. **Swagger Definition**: The swagger definition does not imply any relationship between `actualEndTime` and `allowed`. The `actualEndTime` is related to the timing of a broadcast, whereas `allowed` pertains to geographical restrictions.

3. **Number of Calls**: Although 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the semantic mismatch between a timestamp and region codes strongly suggests that this invariant is not logically valid.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic mismatch and the lack of any logical connection between a timestamp and region codes, this invariant is a "false-positive". The absence of counterexamples in 100 calls is likely due to the invariant being tested on data that did not expose the logical flaw, rather than the invariant being valid.

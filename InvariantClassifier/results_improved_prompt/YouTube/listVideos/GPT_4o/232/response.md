### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered. The response schema includes an `items` array, where each item contains a `contentDetails` object. Within `contentDetails`, there is a `regionRestriction` object, which has a `blocked` property. This `blocked` property is an array of strings, each representing a region code where the video is blocked. The description specifies that these are region codes, which are typically ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes, consisting of two letters.

### Invariant

The invariant states that all elements of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]` have a fixed length of 2.

### Analysis

1. **Specification Consistency**: The description of `blocked` as a list of region codes aligns with the invariant, as region codes are typically two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 1,864 examples were observed, with 40 distinct examples, all adhering to the invariant.

3. **Semantic Reasoning**: Given that region codes are standardized as two-letter codes, it is semantically correct to expect each element in the `blocked` array to have a length of 2.

### Conclusion

The invariant is consistent with the specification and the semantic meaning of the data. The extensive empirical evidence further supports the invariant's validity. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a "true-positive" with high confidence.

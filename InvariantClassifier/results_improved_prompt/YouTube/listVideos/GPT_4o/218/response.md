### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameter**: `maxResults`
  - **Type**: Integer
  - **Description**: Specifies the maximum number of items to be returned in the result set.
  - **Constraints**: Minimum value of 1, maximum value of 50.
- **Response**:
  - **Property**: `pageInfo.totalResults`
  - **Type**: Integer
  - **Description**: The total number of results in the result set.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxResults != return.pageInfo.totalResults`
- **Type**: `IntNonEqual`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `!=` between two long scalars.

### Analysis

1. **Parameter and Response Relationship**:
   - `maxResults` specifies the maximum number of items to be returned, but it does not dictate the total number of results available (`totalResults`).
   - `totalResults` indicates the total number of items available in the result set, which can be greater than `maxResults`.

2. **Examples and Calls**:
   - 1000 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 556 examples were found, with 168 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.
   - Example values show `totalResults` consistently being greater than `maxResults`, which aligns with the expected behavior since `maxResults` is a limit on the number of items returned, not the total available.

3. **Semantic Consistency**:
   - The invariant makes semantic sense because `maxResults` is a constraint on the number of items returned per page, while `totalResults` is the total number of items available.
   - There is no inherent reason for `maxResults` to equal `totalResults` unless the total number of results is less than or equal to the maximum results requested, which is not a typical scenario given the examples.

### Conclusion

The invariant `input.maxResults != return.pageInfo.totalResults` is consistent with the API's behavior and the semantic meaning of the parameters and response properties. Given the number of calls and examples supporting the invariant, it is highly likely to be a **true-positive**.

- **Verdict**: True-positive
- **Confidence**: 0.95

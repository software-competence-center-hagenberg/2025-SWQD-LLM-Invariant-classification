Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                status:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video category, such as its localized title. Next Id: 17
                  properties:
                    uploadStatus:
                      type: string
                      description: The status of the uploaded video.
                      enum: [uploaded, processed, failed, rejected, deleted]


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: "return.status.uploadStatus one of { ""processed"", ""uploaded"" }"

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.OneOfString
Invariant description: Represents String variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 27511 examples in the requests data, with 2 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 2 example values of the variables:
return.items.status.uploadStatus=uploaded
return.items.status.uploadStatus=processed

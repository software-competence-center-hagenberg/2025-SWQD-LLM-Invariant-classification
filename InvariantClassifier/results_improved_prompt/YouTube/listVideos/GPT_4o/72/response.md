### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameter**: `maxHeight` (query parameter)
  - Type: integer
  - Minimum: 72
  - Maximum length: 8192
- **Response**: 200 OK
  - **Schema**: Object containing an array `items`
    - Each item has a `topicDetails` object
      - `topicDetails` contains `topicCategories`, an array of strings (Wikipedia URLs)

### Invariant
- **Invariant**: `input.maxHeight > size(return.topicDetails.topicCategories[])`
- **Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `>` between two long scalars. Prints as `x > y`.

### Analysis
- **Parameter Analysis**: `maxHeight` is a query parameter that is an integer with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192. This parameter likely controls some aspect of the video retrieval, potentially related to video dimensions or quality.
- **Response Analysis**: `topicCategories` is an array of strings representing Wikipedia URLs related to the video's content. The size of this array can vary depending on the video's content and the number of related topics.
- **Invariant Analysis**: The invariant states that the `maxHeight` parameter is always greater than the number of `topicCategories` returned. Given the examples, `maxHeight` values are significantly larger than the number of `topicCategories`, which typically ranges from 1 to a few entries.

### Conclusion
- **Empirical Evidence**: With 10000 calls and no counterexamples, along with 8952 examples supporting the invariant, it appears robust.
- **Semantic Analysis**: While `maxHeight` and `topicCategories` are not directly related, the invariant holds due to the nature of the data: `maxHeight` is a large integer, while `topicCategories` is a small array.
- **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not provide any information that contradicts this invariant.

Given the empirical evidence and lack of contradiction in the specification, the invariant is classified as a "true-positive" with high confidence.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
      - name: part
        in: query
        description: The *part* parameter specifies a comma-separated list of one or more video resource properties that the API response will include. If the parameter identifies a property that contains child properties, the child properties will be included in the response. For example, in a video resource, the snippet property contains the channelId, title, description, tags, and categoryId properties. As such, if you set *part=snippet*, the API response will contain all of those properties.
        required: true
        type: array
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            pageInfo:
              type: object
              description: Paging details for lists of resources, including total number of items available and number of resources returned in a single page.
              properties:
                totalResults:
                  type: integer
                  description: The total number of results in the result set.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.pageInfo.totalResults != size(input.part[])-1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two long scalars. Prints as x != y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 50 examples in the requests data, with 46 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.part=localizations%2Cstatus%2CliveStreamingDetails; return.pageInfo.totalResults=163
input.part=topicDetails%2Cid; return.pageInfo.totalResults=200
input.part=topicDetails%2Csnippet%2Cstatistics%2CrecordingDetails; return.pageInfo.totalResults=100
input.part=status%2Cid%2Cstatistics; return.pageInfo.totalResults=1
input.part=topicDetails; return.pageInfo.totalResults=200

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Parameter**: `maxHeight`
  - **Type**: Integer
  - **Minimum**: 72
  - **Maximum Length**: 8192 (though this seems like a mislabeling, as maxLength typically applies to strings, not integers)
- **Response**: Contains a list of `items`, each with a `snippet` that includes `thumbnails`.
  - **Thumbnail Property**: `medium` with a `width` property of type integer.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxHeight > return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.width`
- **Type**: Integer comparison (greater than)

### Analysis

1. **Parameter and Response Context**:
   - `maxHeight` is a query parameter that likely influences the size of the video or thumbnail being requested.
   - `thumbnails.medium.width` is a property of the response that indicates the width of a medium-sized thumbnail.

2. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The invariant suggests that the requested `maxHeight` is always greater than the `width` of the medium thumbnail returned.
   - This invariant could make sense if `maxHeight` is intended to set a maximum dimension for the video or its thumbnails, but the Swagger definition does not explicitly confirm this relationship.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 19 examples were found supporting the invariant, with 11 distinct examples.
   - Example values consistently show `input.maxHeight` greater than `return.items.snippet.thumbnails.medium.width`.

4. **Specification and Logical Consistency**:
   - The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `maxHeight` directly influences thumbnail dimensions, but it is plausible given the context of video and thumbnail retrieval.
   - The invariant does not contradict any explicitly stated behavior in the Swagger definition.

### Conclusion

Given the empirical evidence and the plausible semantic relationship between `maxHeight` and `thumbnails.medium.width`, the invariant seems to hold true across all tested scenarios. However, the lack of explicit specification linking these two fields introduces some uncertainty.

**Verdict**: True-positive

**Confidence**: 0.8 (High confidence, but not absolute due to lack of explicit specification linking the two fields)

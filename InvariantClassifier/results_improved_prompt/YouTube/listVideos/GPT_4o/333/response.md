### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Parameters**:
  - `maxWidth`: An optional query parameter of type integer with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192.
- **Response**:
  - Contains an array of `items`, each with `contentDetails`.
  - `contentDetails` includes `regionRestriction`, which has a `blocked` property. This property is an array of strings representing region codes where the video is blocked.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxWidth > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`
- **Invariant Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan`
- **Description**: This invariant suggests that the `maxWidth` parameter is always greater than the number of blocked regions in the `regionRestriction.blocked` array.

### Analysis

1. **Parameter and Response Context**:
   - `maxWidth` is related to the player dimensions, specifically its width, and is not directly related to the number of blocked regions.
   - `regionRestriction.blocked` is a list of regions where the video is not viewable.

2. **Semantic Relevance**:
   - There is no direct semantic relationship between `maxWidth` and the number of blocked regions. The `maxWidth` parameter is about video player dimensions, while `regionRestriction.blocked` is about geographical restrictions.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant held true across 10,000 calls with 665 examples and 563 distinct examples.
   - Despite the empirical evidence, the lack of semantic connection between the two variables suggests that the invariant might be coincidental rather than a true logical relationship.

4. **Specification Consideration**:
   - The specification does not indicate any relationship between `maxWidth` and `regionRestriction.blocked`. The invariant seems to be an artifact of the specific data used in the tests rather than a rule enforced by the API.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic connection and the absence of specification support for this invariant, it is likely a "false-positive". The invariant appears to be coincidental, arising from the specific data used in testing rather than a true invariant of the API.

### Confidence

The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear lack of semantic relevance and specification support for the invariant.

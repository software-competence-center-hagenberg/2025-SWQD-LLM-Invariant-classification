### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` that retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema includes an array of items, each with a `status` object. Within this `status` object, there are two boolean properties:

- `publicStatsViewable`: Indicates if the extended video statistics on the watch page can be viewed by everyone.
- `selfDeclaredMadeForKids`: A boolean indicating whether the video is self-declared as made for kids.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.status.publicStatsViewable == return.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids`

This invariant suggests that the `publicStatsViewable` and `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` properties are always equal.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The two properties `publicStatsViewable` and `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` serve different purposes. `publicStatsViewable` is about the visibility of video statistics, while `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` is about the content's suitability for children. There is no inherent reason why these two should always be equal.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 1000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, only 4 examples were observed, with only 1 distinct example. This is a very small sample size, especially given the different semantic purposes of the two fields.

3. **Specification Contradiction**: The specification does not suggest any relationship between these two fields. Given their distinct purposes, it is unlikely that they are inherently linked.

### Conclusion

The invariant `return.status.publicStatsViewable == return.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids` is likely a "false-positive" due to the semantic differences between the two fields and the lack of specification support for such a relationship. The small number of examples and lack of counterexamples in 1000 calls do not provide strong evidence for this invariant being true.

**Confidence**: 0.2 (Low confidence due to the small sample size and semantic mismatch)

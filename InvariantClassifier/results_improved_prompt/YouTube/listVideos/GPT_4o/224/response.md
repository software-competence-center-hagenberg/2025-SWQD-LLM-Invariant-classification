### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of YouTube video resources. The response includes a `pageInfo` object that contains `resultsPerPage`, indicating the number of results included in the API response. The `items` array contains video resources, each with various properties like `kind`, `etag`, `id`, etc.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= size(return.items[])`. This invariant suggests that the number of results per page (`resultsPerPage`) is greater than or equal to the number of items actually returned in the `items` array.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `resultsPerPage` is expected to indicate the maximum number of items that can be returned in a single page. The actual number of items returned (`size(return.items[])`) can be less than or equal to `resultsPerPage`, especially if there are fewer items available than the maximum allowed per page.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 11,630 examples were found supporting the invariant, with 8,234 distinct examples.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The invariant aligns with typical pagination behavior where `resultsPerPage` sets an upper limit on the number of items returned, but the actual number can be less if there are fewer items available.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic alignment with typical pagination logic, the lack of counterexamples after extensive testing, and the large number of supporting examples, this invariant is highly likely to be a "true-positive". The invariant logically follows from the purpose of `resultsPerPage` as a limit rather than a strict count of items returned.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Parameter**: `maxResults` is an optional query parameter that specifies the maximum number of items to return. It must be an integer between 1 and 50.
- **Response**: The response contains an array of `items`, each with a `contentDetails` object that includes a `regionRestriction` object. The `regionRestriction` object has a `blocked` property, which is an array of strings representing region codes where the video is blocked.

### Invariant
- **Invariant**: `input.maxResults > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`
- **Type**: Binary scalar invariant indicating that `maxResults` is greater than the number of blocked regions.

### Analysis
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `maxResults` parameter specifies the maximum number of items (videos) to return, while `regionRestriction.blocked` is a list of regions where a specific video is blocked. These two fields are semantically unrelated because `maxResults` pertains to the number of videos in the response, not the number of blocked regions for a single video.
- **Empirical Evidence**: Out of 100 calls, no counterexamples were found, and 20 examples supported the invariant. However, the invariant's correctness is not supported by the semantic relationship between the fields.
- **Specification Check**: The specification does not imply any relationship between `maxResults` and the size of `blocked[]`. The `blocked` list can vary independently of `maxResults` since it pertains to individual video restrictions.

### Conclusion
The invariant `input.maxResults > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])` is likely a **false-positive**. The lack of counterexamples in 100 calls suggests it might hold in practice, but the semantic disconnect between `maxResults` and `blocked[]` indicates that this invariant is not universally valid. The invariant is coincidental rather than a true relationship dictated by the API's logic or specification.

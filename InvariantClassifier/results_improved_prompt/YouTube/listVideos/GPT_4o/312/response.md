### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is used to retrieve a list of video resources, potentially filtered by some criteria. The response includes a `contentDetails` object for each video, which contains a `regionRestriction` object. This object has a `blocked` property, which is an array of strings representing region codes where the video is blocked. The documentation states that if the `blocked` property is present and contains an empty list, the video is viewable in all countries.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) >= 1`, which implies that the `blocked` array always contains at least one region code.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Documentation**: The documentation explicitly mentions that the `blocked` property can be present with an empty list, indicating that the video is viewable in all countries. This directly contradicts the invariant that the size of the `blocked` array is always at least 1.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: Despite 10,000 calls and 1,822 examples, all of which support the invariant, the documentation provides a clear scenario where the `blocked` list can be empty.

3. **Logical Consistency**: The invariant assumes that there is always at least one region where the video is blocked, which is not a logical necessity given the documentation's allowance for an empty list.

### Conclusion
The invariant `size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) >= 1` is a **false-positive**. The documentation explicitly allows for the `blocked` list to be empty, which means the invariant does not hold universally. The empirical data, while extensive, does not capture all possible scenarios described in the documentation.

**Confidence**: 0.95

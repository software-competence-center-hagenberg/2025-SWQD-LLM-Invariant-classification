### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Retrieves a list of video resources, possibly filtered.
- **Parameters**:
  - **part**: A required query parameter that specifies a comma-separated list of video resource properties to include in the response.
- **Response**:
  - **pageInfo**: Contains paging details, including `resultsPerPage`, which indicates the number of results included in the API response.

### Invariant
- **Invariant**: `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage != size(input.part[])-1`
- **Type**: `IntNonEqual`
- **Description**: Asserts that the number of results per page is not equal to the size of the `part` parameter array minus one.

### Analysis
- **Parameter `part`**: This parameter is a list of video resource properties. The size of this list does not directly correlate with the number of results per page. The `part` parameter determines which properties of the video resources are included in the response, not the number of video resources returned.
- **Response `resultsPerPage`**: This field indicates how many video resources are returned per page, which is independent of the number of properties requested in the `part` parameter.
- **Example Analysis**: The examples provided show various `part` sizes and `resultsPerPage` values, but there is no inherent reason why `resultsPerPage` should be related to `size(input.part[]) - 1`. The invariant suggests a relationship that is not supported by the API's description or logic.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage != size(input.part[])-1` is a **false-positive**. The number of results per page (`resultsPerPage`) is not logically related to the number of properties requested (`size(input.part[])`). The invariant is coincidental based on the examples tested and does not reflect a true logical constraint of the API.

### Confidence
Given the analysis and understanding of the API's functionality, the confidence in this classification is **0.95**. The invariant does not logically follow from the API's design or purpose.

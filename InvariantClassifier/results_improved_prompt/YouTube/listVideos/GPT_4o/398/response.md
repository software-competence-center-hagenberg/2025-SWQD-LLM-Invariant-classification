### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is a GET request that retrieves a list of resources. The response includes a `pageInfo` object, which contains `totalResults`, an integer representing the total number of results in the result set.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.pageInfo.totalResults >= 0`. This invariant suggests that the `totalResults` field in the response will always be greater than or equal to zero.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Specification**: The specification describes `totalResults` as the total number of results in the result set. By definition, a count of results cannot be negative. Therefore, it is logical to expect `totalResults` to always be zero or a positive integer.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 164 distinct examples were observed, all satisfying the invariant.

3. **Semantic Reasoning**: The concept of a total number of results being negative does not make sense in this context. A negative number of results would imply an error in the logic or data handling of the API.

### Conclusion
Given the logical reasoning based on the definition of `totalResults`, the empirical evidence from a large number of API calls, and the semantic understanding of the field, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of the API as described in the Swagger documentation and observed in practice.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` that retrieves a list of video resources. The response includes a list of items, each containing `snippet` and `contentDetails` objects. 

- **`snippet.thumbnails.default.width`**: This is an integer representing the width of a thumbnail image for a video.
- **`contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked`**: This is an array of strings, each representing a region code where the video is blocked.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`

This invariant suggests that the width of the thumbnail image is greater than the number of regions where the video is blocked.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The width of a thumbnail (`snippet.thumbnails.default.width`) is a measure of image size, while `contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked` is a list of region codes. These two fields are semantically unrelated; one pertains to image dimensions and the other to geographical restrictions.
   - There is no inherent reason why the width of a thumbnail should be related to the number of regions where a video is blocked.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 100 API calls, and no counterexamples were found.
   - There are 14 examples supporting the invariant, with 4 distinct examples showing a thumbnail width of 120 and varying numbers of blocked regions.

3. **Specification Consideration**:
   - The specification does not indicate any relationship between thumbnail width and region restrictions.
   - The `regionRestriction.blocked` property is described as deprecated, which might mean it is not consistently used or populated.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic irrelevance between the two fields and the lack of specification support for such a relationship, the invariant is likely a coincidence rather than a true relationship. The invariant is classified as a "false-positive" because it does not logically hold for all possible valid responses from the API, despite the lack of counterexamples in the limited test set.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The API endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is designed to retrieve a list of video resources, potentially filtered by certain parameters. The response includes an array of items, each containing a `snippet` and `contentDetails` object.

- **snippet.thumbnails.high.width**: This is an optional integer representing the width of a high-quality thumbnail image for a video.
- **contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked**: This is an array of strings representing region codes where the video is blocked. If this property is present and contains an empty list, the video is viewable in all countries.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width % size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) == 0`.

This invariant suggests that the width of the high-quality thumbnail image divides evenly by the number of blocked regions.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant attempts to establish a relationship between the width of a video thumbnail and the number of regions where the video is blocked. Semantically, these two properties are unrelated. The width of a thumbnail is a property of the image file, while the blocked regions are a property of the video's distribution rights.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not suggest any relationship between these two fields. The width of a thumbnail is independent of the region restrictions.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 100 calls without finding a counterexample, and 4 distinct examples were found where the invariant holds. However, the lack of a counterexample in 100 calls does not necessarily imply a true relationship, especially given the semantic disconnect.

4. **Potential for Coincidence**: The examples provided show a thumbnail width of 480, which is a common width for video thumbnails. The number of blocked regions in the examples (1, 1, 3, 6) coincidentally divides 480, but this could easily be a coincidence rather than a rule.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic disconnect between thumbnail width and region restrictions, and the lack of any indication in the API specification that these two fields should be related, this invariant is likely a coincidence rather than a true invariant. The empirical evidence, while suggestive, is not strong enough to override the semantic analysis.

**Verdict**: false-positive

**Confidence**: 0.8 (high confidence due to semantic analysis and specification review)

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` with a `GET` method. The response schema includes an `items` array, where each item has a `contentDetails` object. This object contains a `definition` property, which is a string indicating the video quality, with possible values being `sd` (standard definition) or `hd` (high definition).

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.contentDetails.definition)==2`, which suggests that the `definition` string always has a fixed length of 2 characters.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The `definition` field is explicitly defined to have possible values `sd` and `hd`, both of which are 2 characters long.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 28,274 examples were observed, with only two distinct values (`sd` and `hd`), both conforming to the invariant.
3. **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant aligns perfectly with the semantic meaning of the `definition` field as described in the Swagger documentation.

### Conclusion

Given the explicit enumeration of possible values in the Swagger definition, the empirical evidence from a large number of API calls, and the semantic consistency of the invariant, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant accurately reflects the constraints imposed by the API's design and documentation.

**Confidence**: 1.0 (Very high confidence)

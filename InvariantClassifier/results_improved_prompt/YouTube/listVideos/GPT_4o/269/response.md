### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema includes an array of `items`, each containing a `player` object. This `player` object has two properties:

- `embedHtml`: A string representing an `<iframe>` tag that embeds a player for video playback.
- `embedWidth`: A string representing the width of the embed.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.player.embedWidth` is a substring of `return.player.embedHtml`.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Relationship**: The `embedHtml` is an HTML string that includes an `<iframe>` tag. Typically, such tags include attributes like `width`, `height`, `src`, etc. It is reasonable to expect that the `embedWidth` value, which represents the width, would be included as part of the `width` attribute within the `embedHtml` string.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there were 21,277 examples supporting the invariant, with 17,881 being distinct. This high number of examples and the lack of counterexamples strongly suggest that the invariant holds consistently.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not explicitly mention any other format or structure for `embedHtml` that would exclude `embedWidth`. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the invariant and the specification.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic relationship between `embedWidth` and `embedHtml`, the extensive empirical evidence supporting the invariant, and the lack of any specification contradictions, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive".

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/youtube/v3/videos`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameter**: `maxHeight`
  - Type: integer
  - Minimum: 72
  - Maximum: 8192
- **Response**:
  - **Property**: `pageInfo`
    - **Sub-property**: `resultsPerPage`
      - Type: integer
      - Description: The number of results included in the API response.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.maxHeight > return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage`
- **Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `>` between two long scalars. Prints as `x > y`.

### Analysis

1. **Parameter and Response Context**:
   - `maxHeight` is a query parameter that seems to relate to some form of filtering or limiting the height of a video or a related resource.
   - `resultsPerPage` indicates the number of results returned in a single page of the API response.

2. **Semantic Relationship**:
   - There is no direct semantic relationship between `maxHeight` and `resultsPerPage` based on the provided description. `maxHeight` seems to relate to a property of the video (possibly its resolution), whereas `resultsPerPage` is related to pagination.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 5,312 distinct examples support the invariant.
   - Example values show `maxHeight` consistently greater than `resultsPerPage`.

4. **Specification Analysis**:
   - The specification does not explicitly mention any relationship between `maxHeight` and `resultsPerPage`.
   - The invariant seems to be coincidental rather than intentional, as the two fields serve different purposes.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic connection between `maxHeight` and `resultsPerPage`, the invariant appears to be a coincidental correlation rather than a true invariant. The specification does not support any logical relationship between these two fields, and thus, the invariant is likely a false-positive despite the empirical evidence.

### Verdict
- **Classification**: `false-positive`
- **Confidence**: 0.7 (Moderate confidence due to strong empirical evidence but lack of semantic connection)

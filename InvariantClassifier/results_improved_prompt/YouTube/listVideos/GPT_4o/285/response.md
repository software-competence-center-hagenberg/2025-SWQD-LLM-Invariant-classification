### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` is designed to retrieve a list of video resources. The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a `snippet` and `contentDetails` object. Within `snippet`, there is a `thumbnails` object with a `default` property that includes a `height` attribute. The `contentDetails` object includes a `regionRestriction` object with a `blocked` property, which is an array of strings representing region codes where the video is blocked.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is:

`return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height % size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) == 0`

This invariant suggests that the height of the default thumbnail divides evenly by the number of blocked regions.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant attempts to establish a relationship between the height of a thumbnail and the number of blocked regions. Semantically, these two attributes are unrelated. The height of a thumbnail is a visual property, while the number of blocked regions is a content restriction property.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not suggest any relationship between thumbnail dimensions and region restrictions. The `height` is described as an optional integer, and the `blocked` list is described as a list of region codes.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held true for 100 API calls without a counterexample. However, only 4 distinct examples were found, all with a thumbnail height of 90 and varying numbers of blocked regions. This limited dataset does not provide strong evidence for a true relationship.

4. **Logical Consistency**: The invariant implies a mathematical relationship that lacks logical consistency given the independent nature of the two fields involved.

### Conclusion
The invariant is likely a "false-positive" due to the lack of semantic connection between the thumbnail height and the number of blocked regions. The absence of counterexamples in a limited dataset does not sufficiently support the invariant's validity. The invariant appears to be coincidental rather than indicative of a true underlying rule.

**Confidence**: 0.7

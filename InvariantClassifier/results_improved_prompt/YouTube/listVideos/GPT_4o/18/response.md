### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition provided describes an endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered. The response schema includes an `items` array, where each item has a `contentDetails` object. Within `contentDetails`, there is a `projection` property, which is a string that can take on one of two values: `rectangular` or `360`.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.contentDetails.projection == "rectangular"`.

### Analysis
- **Swagger Specification**: The `projection` property is explicitly defined to have two possible values: `rectangular` and `360`. This indicates that the API is designed to support both types of projections.
- **Empirical Data**: In 100 API calls, only the value `rectangular` was observed for the `projection` property. This suggests that, in practice, the API might predominantly return `rectangular` projections.
- **Distinct Examples**: Out of 427 examples, only 1 distinct example was found, which was `rectangular`. This further supports the empirical observation.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.contentDetails.projection == "rectangular"` is likely a **false-positive**. Despite the empirical evidence suggesting that `rectangular` is the only observed value, the Swagger specification clearly allows for another value, `360`. The absence of `360` in the observed data could be due to the specific dataset or conditions under which the API was tested, rather than a true restriction of the API itself.

### Confidence
Given the clear specification allowing for another value, the confidence in this classification is high.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` with a `GET` method. The endpoint retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered. The response schema includes an array of `items`, each having a `contentDetails` object. Within `contentDetails`, there is a `projection` property, which is a string and can take one of the values specified in the enum: `[rectangular, 360]`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: "`return.contentDetails.projection one of { "360", "rectangular" }`".

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Definition Alignment**: The Swagger definition explicitly states that the `projection` property can take on the values "rectangular" or "360". This aligns perfectly with the invariant provided.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 27,847 examples were observed, with only two distinct values, which match the values specified in the invariant.

3. **Semantic Consistency**: The `projection` property is semantically meant to specify the format of the video, and the values "rectangular" and "360" are logical options for such a property.

### Conclusion

Given the explicit enumeration in the Swagger definition, the extensive empirical evidence supporting the invariant, and the semantic appropriateness of the values, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant is consistent with the API's specification and observed behavior.

### Confidence

The confidence in this classification is very high due to the alignment with the specification and the large number of confirming examples without any counterexamples.

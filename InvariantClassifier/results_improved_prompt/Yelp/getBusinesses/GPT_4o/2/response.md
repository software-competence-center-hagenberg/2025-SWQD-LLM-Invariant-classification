### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes a REST API endpoint `/businesses/search` with a `GET` method. The response for a successful request (HTTP status code 200) includes an object with a property `businesses`, which is an array. Each item in this array has a `coordinates` object.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.coordinates != null`, which suggests that for each business returned in the response, the `coordinates` object is not null.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Definition**: The Swagger definition specifies that each business item has a `coordinates` object. However, it does not explicitly state whether this object can be null or must always be present.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls to the API, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

3. **Semantic Consideration**: In the context of a business search API, it is reasonable to expect that businesses would have location data, such as coordinates, especially if the API is designed to return businesses based on location criteria.

4. **Specification Ambiguity**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `coordinates` must always be non-null, but the absence of counterexamples in a large number of tests suggests that this might be an implicit requirement or a current implementation detail.

### Conclusion

Given the large number of tests without counterexamples and the reasonable expectation that businesses would have coordinates, it is likely that the invariant `return.coordinates != null` is a "true-positive". However, the lack of explicit specification in the Swagger definition introduces some uncertainty.

**Verdict**: true-positive

**Confidence**: 0.85 (High confidence due to empirical evidence, but not absolute due to lack of explicit specification)

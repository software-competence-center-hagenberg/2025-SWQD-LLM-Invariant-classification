### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes an endpoint `/businesses/search` with a `GET` method. The response for a successful request (HTTP status code 200) is an object that includes a `region` property. This `region` property is itself an object that contains a `center` property.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.region.center != null`. This invariant suggests that the `center` property within the `region` object of the response is never `null`.

### Analysis

1. **Schema Definition**: The Swagger definition specifies that `region` and `center` are objects. However, it does not explicitly state whether `center` can be `null` or not. The absence of a `null` type in the schema suggests that `center` is expected to be an object, but it does not guarantee that it cannot be `null`.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This is a strong empirical indication that the invariant holds true in practice.

3. **Semantic Context**: The `center` property likely represents a geographical center or a similar concept, which is typically expected to be present in a response about businesses in a region. This adds a semantic expectation that `center` should not be `null`.

4. **Specification Ambiguity**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `center` cannot be `null`, leaving room for interpretation. However, given the context and the empirical evidence, it seems reasonable to assume that `center` is always expected to be present.

### Conclusion

Given the strong empirical evidence from 10,000 calls without a counterexample, and the reasonable semantic expectation that `center` should not be `null`, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". However, the lack of explicit specification in the Swagger definition introduces a slight uncertainty.

**Verdict**: true-positive

**Confidence**: 0.9

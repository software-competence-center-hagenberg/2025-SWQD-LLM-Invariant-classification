Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/businesses/search"
  get:
    summary: Get businesses
    description: Get businesses
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Get businesses
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            businesses:
              type: array
              items:
                transactions:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    type: string
              items:
                location:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    display_address:
                      type: array
                      items:
                        type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: size(return.transactions[])-1 <= size(return.location.display_address[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntLessEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of <= between two long scalars. Prints as x <= y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "businesses" in the response body.

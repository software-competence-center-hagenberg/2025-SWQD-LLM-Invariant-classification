### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes an endpoint `/businesses/search` that returns a list of businesses. Each business can have multiple categories, and each category is an object with properties `alias` and `title`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `size(return.categories[]) >= 1`, which implies that every business returned by the API has at least one category associated with it.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that a business must have at least one category. However, the structure suggests that categories are a part of the business object.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 2574 examples were observed, with 1143 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.

3. **Semantic Reasoning**: It is reasonable to assume that businesses would typically have at least one category for classification purposes. This is common in business directories or search APIs where categorization is essential for filtering and searching.

4. **Lack of Contradictory Evidence**: There is no evidence from the Swagger definition or the examples provided that contradicts the invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the empirical evidence from a significant number of calls and examples, along with the reasonable assumption that businesses are categorized, the invariant `size(return.categories[]) >= 1` is likely a true-positive. The lack of explicit contradiction in the Swagger definition further supports this conclusion.

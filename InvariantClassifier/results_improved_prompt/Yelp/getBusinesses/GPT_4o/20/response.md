### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/businesses/search` returns a list of businesses. Each business has a `coordinates` object with `latitude` and `longitude` properties, both of which are numbers.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.coordinates.latitude != return.coordinates.longitude`, which suggests that for each business returned, the latitude and longitude are not equal.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Context**: Latitude and longitude are geographical coordinates. By definition, they represent different dimensions of a location on the Earth's surface: latitude measures north-south position, while longitude measures east-west position. It is highly unlikely for these two values to be equal for any given location, except in very specific and rare cases (e.g., a point on the equator and prime meridian intersection).

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 API calls, yielding 184,055 examples without a single counterexample. This extensive testing provides strong empirical support for the invariant.

3. **Specification and Common Knowledge**: The Swagger specification does not explicitly state that latitude and longitude must be different, but common geographical knowledge supports this invariant. The specification allows for any number values, but the nature of geographical coordinates inherently supports the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic meaning of latitude and longitude, the extensive empirical evidence from 10,000 calls, and the lack of any counterexamples, it is highly likely that the invariant `return.coordinates.latitude != return.coordinates.longitude` is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of geographical coordinates, where latitude and longitude are inherently different.

**Confidence**: 0.95

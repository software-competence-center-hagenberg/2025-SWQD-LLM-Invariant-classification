### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes an endpoint `/businesses/search` which returns a list of businesses. Each business has properties including `distance` (a number) and `rating` (also a number). The `distance` likely represents how far the business is from a certain point, and `rating` represents some form of user or system rating of the business.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.distance > return.rating`. This suggests that for every business returned by the API, the `distance` value is greater than the `rating` value.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: 
   - **Distance**: Typically, distance is measured in units such as meters or kilometers and can vary widely, often being much larger than typical rating values.
   - **Rating**: Ratings are often on a scale such as 1 to 5 or 1 to 10, and thus are usually smaller numbers.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: 
   - The invariant was tested with 100 calls and no counterexamples were found.
   - There are 2574 examples supporting the invariant, with 1629 distinct examples.
   - Example values provided show `distance` values significantly larger than `rating` values, which aligns with typical expectations of these types of data.

3. **Specification and Context**:
   - The Swagger definition does not specify any particular relationship between `distance` and `rating`, but given the typical nature of these values, the invariant seems plausible.
   - There is no explicit mention in the specification that contradicts the invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic understanding of `distance` and `rating`, the empirical evidence supporting the invariant, and the lack of any specification details that contradict it, the invariant `return.distance > return.rating` is likely a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with typical expectations of these values, and the extensive testing without counterexamples further supports this conclusion.

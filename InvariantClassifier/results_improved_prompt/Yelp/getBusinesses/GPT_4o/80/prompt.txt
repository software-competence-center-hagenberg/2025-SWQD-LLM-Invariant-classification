This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/businesses/search"
  get:
    summary: Get businesses
    description: Get businesses
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Get businesses

          properties:
            businesses:

              items:
                distance:
                  type: number
              items:
                rating:
                  type: number

Invariant: return.distance != return.rating

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.FloatNonEqual

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/businesses/search"
  get:
    summary: Get businesses
    description: Get businesses
    parameters:
      - name: open_at
        in: query
        required: false
        type: integer
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Get businesses
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            businesses:
              type: array
              items:
                review_count:
                  type: integer


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.open_at > return.review_count

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "businesses" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 14946 examples in the requests data, with 12994 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.open_at=1663883703; return.businesses.review_count=13
input.open_at=1663846092; return.businesses.review_count=82
input.open_at=1663960344; return.businesses.review_count=1933
input.open_at=1663760052; return.businesses.review_count=63
input.open_at=1663822230; return.businesses.review_count=1

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.total >= 0

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.LowerBound
Invariant description: Represents the invariant x >= c, where c is a constant and x is a long scalar.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 1008 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.total=23600
return.total=4100
return.total=8700
return.total=260
return.total=262

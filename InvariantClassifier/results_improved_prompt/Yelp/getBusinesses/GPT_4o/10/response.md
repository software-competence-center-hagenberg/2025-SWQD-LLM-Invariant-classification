### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes an endpoint `/businesses/search` with a `GET` method. The response schema for a successful `200` response includes an object with a `businesses` property, which is an array. Each item in this array has a `location` object, which further contains a `display_address` property. This `display_address` is an array of strings.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.location.display_address != null`. This invariant suggests that for every business returned by the API, the `display_address` field within the `location` object is never `null`.

### Analysis

1. **Schema Implication**: According to the schema, `display_address` is an array of strings. The schema does not specify that `display_address` can be `null`, implying that it should always be an array, even if empty.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical backing for the invariant.

3. **Semantic Consideration**: The `display_address` is a crucial part of a business's location information. It is reasonable to expect that a business entry would always have some form of address, even if it is an empty array, rather than `null`.

### Conclusion

Given the schema's implication that `display_address` should be an array and the lack of any counterexamples in a large number of tests, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The semantic importance of `display_address` further supports this conclusion.

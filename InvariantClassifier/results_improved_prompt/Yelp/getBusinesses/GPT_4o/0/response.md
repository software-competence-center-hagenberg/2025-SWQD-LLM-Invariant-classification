### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes a REST API endpoint `/businesses/search` with a `GET` method. The endpoint is designed to return a list of businesses. The relevant part of the response schema is an object containing a `businesses` array. Each item in this array has a `categories` field, which is also an array. The `categories` array contains objects with `alias` and `title` properties.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.categories != null`. This invariant suggests that for every business returned by the API, the `categories` field is never `null`.

### Analysis

1. **Schema Analysis**: The Swagger definition specifies that `categories` is an array. In JSON, an array can be empty but not `null` unless explicitly set to `null`. The definition does not specify that `categories` can be `null`, which suggests that it is expected to be an array (possibly empty, but not `null`).

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This high number of calls without a counterexample strongly suggests that the invariant holds true across a wide range of scenarios.

3. **Semantic Consideration**: In the context of a business listing, it is reasonable to expect that a business would have a `categories` field, even if it is an empty array. This aligns with typical data modeling practices where an array is used to represent a collection of items, which can be empty but not `null`.

### Conclusion

Given the schema definition, the semantic context, and the empirical evidence from 10,000 calls, it is highly likely that the invariant `return.categories != null` is a "true-positive". The schema does not indicate that `categories` can be `null`, and the extensive testing supports this conclusion.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes an endpoint `/businesses/search` with a `GET` method. The response schema for a successful request (`200` status code) includes an object with a property `businesses`, which is an array. Each item in this array is expected to have a `location` property, which is an object.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.location != null`, which implies that for each business object in the `businesses` array, the `location` property is not null.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The Swagger definition specifies that each item in the `businesses` array has a `location` property. However, it does not explicitly state that this property cannot be null. The type being an object does not inherently prevent it from being null.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests that in practice, the `location` property is consistently non-null.

3. **Contextual Reasoning**: In the context of a business search API, it is reasonable to expect that each business would have a location. A business without a location might not be useful in a search context, which could explain why the `location` is always non-null in practice.

### Conclusion

Given the empirical evidence and the reasonable assumption that businesses should have a location, the invariant `return.location != null` is likely a "true-positive". The lack of counterexamples in a large number of trials supports this conclusion, and the context of the API aligns with the invariant's expectation.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/businesses/search` that returns a list of businesses. Each business has a `location` object, which includes a `display_address`. The `display_address` is an array of strings, presumably representing different parts of the address (e.g., street, city, postal code, country).

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `size(return.location.display_address[]) >= 1`, which means that for every business returned, the `display_address` array contains at least one element.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `display_address` is meant to represent the address of a business. It is reasonable to expect that every business has at least one line of address information. An empty address would not be useful for identifying or locating a business.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 181,481 examples of this invariant holding, with 93,771 distinct examples. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The Swagger definition does not specify that `display_address` can be empty. The definition implies that `display_address` should contain address information, which supports the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic expectation that a business should have an address, the lack of counterexamples in a large number of tests, and the absence of specification details allowing for an empty `display_address`, the invariant `size(return.location.display_address[]) >= 1` is likely a "true-positive". It aligns with the expected behavior of the API and is supported by extensive empirical evidence.

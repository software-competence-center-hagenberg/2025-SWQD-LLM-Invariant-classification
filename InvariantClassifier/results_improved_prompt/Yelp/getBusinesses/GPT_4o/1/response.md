### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition provided describes an endpoint `/businesses/search` which returns a list of businesses. Each business can have multiple categories, and each category is represented as an object with properties `alias` and `title`. However, the types of `alias` and `title` are not specified in the provided excerpt.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.categories[] elements != null`, which implies that none of the elements in the `categories` array should be `null`.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Definition**: The Swagger definition indicates that `categories` is an array of objects. However, it does not explicitly state whether `null` values are allowed or not.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests that in practice, the API does not return `null` elements in the `categories` array.

3. **Semantic Analysis**: Semantically, it makes sense for the `categories` array to not contain `null` values, as each category is expected to be an object with specific properties (`alias` and `title`). Returning `null` would not be meaningful in this context.

4. **Specification Ambiguity**: The lack of explicit mention of `null` values in the Swagger definition leaves room for interpretation. However, given the empirical evidence and the semantic reasoning, it is reasonable to conclude that `null` values are not intended to be part of the `categories` array.

### Conclusion
Given the empirical evidence from 10,000 calls without a counterexample, the semantic reasoning that `null` values would not be meaningful in the `categories` array, and the lack of explicit contradiction in the Swagger definition, it is highly likely that the invariant is a "true-positive."

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes an endpoint `/businesses/search` which returns a list of businesses. Each business in the response has a `coordinates` object, which includes a `longitude` property of type `number`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.coordinates.longitude != 0`, which means that the longitude value for any business returned by the API should never be zero.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: Longitude is a geographical coordinate that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth's surface. A longitude of 0 corresponds to the Prime Meridian, which passes through Greenwich, England. While it is possible for a business to be located at this longitude, it is relatively rare.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there were 184,055 examples of longitude values, with 59,704 distinct values, none of which were zero.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the longitude value, other than it being a number. However, the absence of zero in such a large sample size suggests that businesses with a longitude of zero are either extremely rare or filtered out by the API.

### Conclusion

Given the large number of examples and the absence of zero as a longitude value, the invariant `return.coordinates.longitude != 0` is likely a "true-positive". The invariant makes sense in the context of the API, as businesses are unlikely to be located exactly on the Prime Meridian. However, without explicit constraints in the specification, there is a small possibility that a business could theoretically have a longitude of zero.

**Confidence**: 0.9 (High confidence due to empirical evidence and logical reasoning, but acknowledging the theoretical possibility of a zero longitude business).

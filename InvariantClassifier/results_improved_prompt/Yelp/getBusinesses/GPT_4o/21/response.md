### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/businesses/search` is designed to retrieve businesses. The relevant part of the response schema includes:
- `businesses`: An array of business objects.
  - Each business object contains:
    - `coordinates`: An object with a `latitude` property of type `number`.
    - `distance`: A property of type `number`.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.coordinates.latitude < return.distance`.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Meaning**:
   - `latitude`: Represents the geographical latitude of a business location, typically ranging from -90 to 90 degrees.
   - `distance`: Represents the distance from a certain point (likely the search origin) to the business location, measured in some unit (e.g., meters, kilometers).

2. **Invariant Evaluation**:
   - The invariant suggests that the latitude of a business is always less than the distance to the business.
   - Given the typical range of latitude values (-90 to 90), it is plausible that the distance to a business (which can be much larger than 90) is often greater than the latitude.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 50 calls were made to the API without finding a counterexample.
   - 892 examples were found, with 858 being distinct, all supporting the invariant.
   - Example values show latitude values significantly smaller than distance values, which is consistent with the invariant.

4. **Specification Check**:
   - The swagger definition does not explicitly contradict the invariant.
   - The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of geographical coordinates and distances.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.coordinates.latitude < return.distance` is consistent with the semantic understanding of latitude and distance. The empirical evidence strongly supports the invariant, and there is no specification detail that contradicts it. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a "true-positive" with high confidence.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/businesses/search` which returns a list of businesses. Each business has a `location` object, which includes a `display_address` property. This `display_address` is an array of strings, presumably representing the components of the business's address.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `size(return.location.display_address[]) >= 2`, which suggests that the `display_address` array always contains at least two elements.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Definition**: The `display_address` is defined as an array of strings. There is no explicit constraint in the Swagger definition that enforces a minimum size for this array.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 50 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 892 examples were collected, with 882 being distinct, all supporting the invariant.

3. **Semantic Consideration**: An address typically consists of multiple components, such as street name, city, and postal code, which supports the idea that the `display_address` would naturally have at least two elements.

4. **Likelihood of True-Positive**: Given the nature of addresses and the empirical evidence supporting the invariant, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is likely a true-positive. The invariant aligns with the typical structure of addresses, which usually contain multiple parts.

### Conclusion
The invariant `size(return.location.display_address[]) >= 2` is likely a true-positive. The empirical evidence strongly supports the invariant, and it aligns with the typical structure of an address, which usually contains multiple components.

**Verdict**: True-positive
**Confidence**: 0.9

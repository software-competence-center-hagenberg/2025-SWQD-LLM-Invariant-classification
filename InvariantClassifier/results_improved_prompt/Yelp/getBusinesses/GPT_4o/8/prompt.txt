Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/businesses/search"
  get:
    summary: Get businesses
    description: Get businesses
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Get businesses
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            businesses:
              type: array
              items:
                transactions:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: "return.transactions[] elements one of { ""delivery"", ""pickup"", ""restaurant_reservation"" }"

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.stringsequence.EltOneOfString
Invariant description: Represents sequences of String values where the elements of the sequence take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x[] elements == c (when there is only one value), or as x[] elements one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "businesses" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 45723 examples in the requests data, with 15 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.businesses.transactions=["pickup","delivery"]
return.businesses.transactions=["pickup"]
return.businesses.transactions=["restaurant_reservation"]
return.businesses.transactions=["pickup","restaurant_reservation"]
return.businesses.transactions=["restaurant_reservation","delivery","pickup"]

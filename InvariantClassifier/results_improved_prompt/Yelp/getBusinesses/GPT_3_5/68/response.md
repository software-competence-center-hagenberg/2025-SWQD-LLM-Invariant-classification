- The endpoint "/businesses/search" has a GET method with a query parameter "open_at" of type integer.
- The response schema includes an array of businesses, each containing an array of categories.

## Invariant
- Invariant: input.open_at > size(return.businesses.categories[])
- Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
- Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars.
- Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
- Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
- The return fields refer to the path "businesses" in the response body.

## Analysis
Based on the provided data, the invariant states that the value of "open_at" in the request should be greater than the size of the categories array in the response for each business. The data includes 14280 examples, with 12363 distinct examples, and none of them contradict the invariant. The examples show various values of "open_at" and the corresponding categories arrays in the response, and in each case, the invariant holds true.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant "input.open_at > size(return.businesses.categories[])" is classified as a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is very high.

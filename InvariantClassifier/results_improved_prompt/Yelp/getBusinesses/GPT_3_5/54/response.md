## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/businesses/search' has a GET operation with a parameter 'price' of type array.
- The response schema includes a field 'total' of type integer.

This means that the total number of businesses returned should not be equal to the size of the 'price' array in the request.

## Analysis

The invariant holds true for the given examples, and the response 'total' does not seem to be influenced by the size of the 'price' array in the request. The high number of examples and the absence of counterexamples increase the confidence in the classification.

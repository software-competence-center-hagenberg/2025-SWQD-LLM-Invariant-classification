## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/businesses/search" has a GET operation with a parameter "categories" of type array.
- The response schema includes a property "total" of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.total != size(input.categories[])

## Analysis
- We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- We found 10 examples in the requests data, with 10 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples of input.categories and return.total do not violate the invariant.
- The invariant makes sense in the context of the API, as it checks if the total count in the response is not equal to the size of the input categories array.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is likely a true-positive as it holds for all the examples tested and makes semantic sense in the context of the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a REST endpoint for getting businesses, with a response schema containing an array of businesses, each with a coordinates object containing a longitude field.

## Invariant
The invariant is that return.coordinates.longitude != 0, meaning that the longitude of the coordinates for each business should not be equal to 0.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the large number of calls made (10000), it is evident that the longitude values for the businesses' coordinates are all non-zero. The examples provided and the high number of distinct examples support the validity of the invariant.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.95

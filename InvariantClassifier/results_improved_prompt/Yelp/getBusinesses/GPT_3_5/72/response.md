## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving businesses.
- The response body contains an array of businesses, each with coordinates (including longitude) and distance.

## Invariant
The invariant is that return.coordinates.longitude != return.distance, where return refers to the fields in the response body.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- We found 183163 examples in the requests data, with 66074 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided also show a clear distinction between the longitude and distance values for the businesses.
- The semantics of longitude and distance suggest that they should not be equal in the context of business coordinates and distance.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the semantic meaning of the variables, it is highly likely that the invariant return.coordinates.longitude != return.distance is a true-positive.

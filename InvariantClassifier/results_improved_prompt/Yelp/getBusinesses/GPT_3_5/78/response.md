## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provided describes a REST endpoint for getting businesses. The response schema includes a field 'businesses' which is an array of objects, each containing a 'location' object. The 'location' object has a 'display_address' field, which is an array of strings.

## Invariant
The invariant is size(return.location.display_address[]) >= 1, which means that the size of the 'display_address' array in the 'location' object of each business in the response must be greater than or equal to 1.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the nature of the 'display_address' field, it is reasonable to expect that each business location would have at least one display address. The examples provided in the request data also support this expectation, as they all contain at least one address in the 'display_address' array.

## Conclusion
Given the nature of the 'display_address' field and the examples provided, it is highly likely that the invariant size(return.location.display_address[]) >= 1 is a true-positive. The large number of examples and the absence of counterexamples in the 10000 calls on the API provide strong evidence for the correctness of this invariant.

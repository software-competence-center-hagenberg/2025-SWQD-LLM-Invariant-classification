## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/businesses/search' has a 'get' operation with a parameter 'open_at' of type integer in the query.
- The response schema includes an array of 'businesses', each containing an array of 'transactions', which are of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.open_at > size(return.transactions[])

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, we can see that the 'open_at' parameter is an integer representing a timestamp, and the 'transactions' array contains strings representing different types of transactions. The invariant checks if the 'open_at' value is greater than the number of transactions, which seems to be a reasonable condition for this API. The examples provided also support the invariant, as the 'open_at' values are consistently greater than the number of transactions in the response.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing with 10000 calls, where no counterexamples were found, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The semantic meaning of the variables also aligns with the invariant, further supporting its validity.

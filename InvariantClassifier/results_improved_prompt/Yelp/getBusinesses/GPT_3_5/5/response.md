## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/businesses/search' has a GET method to retrieve businesses.
- The response schema includes a field 'businesses' which is an array of objects, each containing a boolean field 'is_closed'.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.is_closed == false', which means that the 'is_closed' field in each business object in the response must be false.

## Analysis
Based on the provided information, the invariant 'return.is_closed == false' is likely a true-positive. The invariant specifies a condition that the 'is_closed' field in the 'businesses' array must be false, and the data from 100 calls on the API did not find a single counter example. Additionally, there are 2574 examples in the requests data, with 1 distinct example, supporting the likelihood of the invariant being true-positive.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/businesses/search" has a GET operation to retrieve businesses.
- The response schema includes a field called "businesses" which is an array of objects.

## Invariant
- The invariant is that "return.businesses != null" which means that the field "businesses" in the response should not be null.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided Swagger definition, the response schema does include the field "businesses" as an array, and it is unlikely to be null based on the typical behavior of such endpoints.
- The invariant is a simple check for the non-nullness of the "businesses" field, and given the nature of the response schema, it is reasonable to assume that this invariant holds true for valid requests.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant "return.businesses != null" is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

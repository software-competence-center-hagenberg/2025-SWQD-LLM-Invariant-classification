## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/businesses/search" has a GET method with a parameter 'radius' of type integer and a response schema with a nested 'display_address' field.

## Invariant
- Invariant: input.radius > size(return.location.display_address[])
- Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
- Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
- Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
- Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
- The return fields refer to the path "businesses" in the response body.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 103084 examples in the requests data, with 87939 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples of input.radius and return.businesses.location.display_address do not violate the invariant.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples we have.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

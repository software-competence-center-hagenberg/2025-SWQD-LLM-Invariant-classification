- The endpoint '/businesses/search' has a GET method with a 'radius' query parameter.
- The response schema includes a 'businesses' array, each item of which contains a 'categories' array.

## Invariant
- Invariant: input.radius > size(return.categories[])
- Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
- Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
- Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
- Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
- The return fields refer to the path "businesses" in the response body.

## Analysis
The invariant states that the value of 'input.radius' should be greater than the size of 'return.businesses.categories'.
Based on the provided examples, the invariant seems to hold true for all the tested cases. The examples show that the 'input.radius' is consistently greater than the size of 'return.businesses.categories'.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent validation of the invariant across the examples, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/businesses/search' is a GET request that retrieves businesses.
- The 'offset' parameter is an optional query parameter of type integer.
- The response schema includes a 'total' property of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the 'offset' parameter in the request is not equal to the 'total' property in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, it is evident that the 'offset' and 'total' values are distinct and do not have a direct relationship. The examples show different values for 'offset' and 'total', indicating that the invariant holds true for the tested cases.

## Conclusion
Given the nature of the API and the examples provided, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. The invariant holds for the tested cases, and there is no indication from the API specification that contradicts this relationship. Therefore, the verdict is true-positive with a high confidence level.

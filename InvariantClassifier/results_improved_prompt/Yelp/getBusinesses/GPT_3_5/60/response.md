## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides a GET endpoint for retrieving businesses.
- The response schema includes a field 'businesses' which is an array of objects, each containing an 'id' field of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant is LENGTH(return.id)==22, indicating that the length of the 'id' field in the 'businesses' array should always be 22 characters.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on the API and found 184055 examples in the requests data, with 61703 distinct examples.
- All 61703 distinct examples of the 'id' field in the response body have a length of 22 characters.
- The invariant has been validated for a large number of calls and has held true for all of them.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

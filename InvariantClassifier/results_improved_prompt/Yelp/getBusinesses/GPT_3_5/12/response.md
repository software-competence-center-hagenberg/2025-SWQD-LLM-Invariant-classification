## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a REST endpoint for getting businesses, with a response schema containing a field 'display_address' within the 'location' object.

## Invariant
- The invariant is size(return.location.display_address[]) >= 2, which checks if the size of the 'display_address' array in the response is greater than or equal to 2.

## Analysis
- We have tried 50 calls on the API and found 892 examples in the requests data, with 882 of them being distinct examples. The examples provided show that the 'display_address' array always contains at least 2 elements, which supports the invariant.
- The response data provides 5 example values of the 'display_address' array, all of which contain 2 or more elements, further supporting the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive, as it holds for every valid request on the API.

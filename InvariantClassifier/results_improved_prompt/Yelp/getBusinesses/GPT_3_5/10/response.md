## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/businesses/search' is a GET request to retrieve businesses.
- The response schema includes a field 'businesses', which is an array of objects.
- Each object in the 'businesses' array has a 'location' field, which is an object with a 'display_address' field that is an array of strings.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.location.display_address != null', which means that the 'display_address' field in the 'location' object should not be null.

## Analysis
- The invariant is checking that the 'display_address' field is not null, which is consistent with the response schema.
- The response schema specifies that 'display_address' is an array of strings, so it should never be null.
- Given that 10000 calls have been made without finding a single counter example, it is highly likely that the invariant holds true for this API.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing, the invariant 'return.location.display_address != null' is classified as a true-positive.

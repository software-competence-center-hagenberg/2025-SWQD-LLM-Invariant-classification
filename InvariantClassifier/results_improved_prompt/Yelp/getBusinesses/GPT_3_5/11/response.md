## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/businesses/search' has a GET method to retrieve businesses.
- The response schema includes a field 'businesses' which is an array of objects, each containing a field 'categories' which is an array of objects.

## Invariant
- The invariant is size(return.categories[]) >= 1, which means that the size of the 'categories' array in the response must be greater than or equal to 1.

## Analysis
- We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 2574 examples in the requests data, with 1143 of them being distinct examples.
- The example values of the 'categories' array in the response show that it always contains at least one object.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples we have, and we have a large number of examples to support this.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the large number of examples, the invariant 'size(return.categories[]) >= 1' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

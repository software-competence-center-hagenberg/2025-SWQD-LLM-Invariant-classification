## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/businesses/search" has a GET operation with a parameter named "attributes" of type array in the query.
- The response schema includes a field "businesses" which contains an array of items, each with a field "transactions" of type array containing string items.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a comparison between the size of the input array "attributes" and the size of the array "transactions" within the response.
- The invariant states that the size of the input array minus 1 should be less than or equal to the size of the transactions array.

## Analysis
- We have tried 50 calls on the API and found 14 distinct examples, none of which were counterexamples to the invariant.
- The examples provided show different values for the input attributes and the transactions in the response.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples we have found.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the examples, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a REST endpoint for getting businesses, with a response schema that includes a 'region' object, which contains a 'center' object.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.region.center != null', which checks if the 'center' object in the response 'region' object is not null.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided swagger definition, the 'center' object is nested within the 'region' object, and there is no indication in the specification that 'center' can be null. Given that 10000 calls have been made to the API without finding a counter example, it is likely that the 'center' object is always present in the response and is not null.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: true-positive
- Confidence: 0.9

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/businesses/search"
  get:
    summary: Get businesses
    description: Get businesses
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Get businesses
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            businesses:
              type: array
              items:
                location:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    address1:
                      type: string
                  properties:
                    display_address:
                      type: array
                      items:
                        type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.location.address1 in return.location.display_address[]

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.sequenceString.MemberString
Invariant description: Represents String scalars that are always members of a sequence of String values. Prints as x in y[] where x is a String scalar and y[] is a sequence of String.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "businesses" in the response body.

We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 2543 examples in the requests data, with 1642 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.businesses.location.address1=?????2-9-13; return.businesses.location.display_address=["?????2-9-13","Hiroshima, ??? ?730-0051","Japan"]
return.businesses.location.address1=299 Broadway; return.businesses.location.display_address=["299 Broadway","Fl 17","New York, NY 10007"]

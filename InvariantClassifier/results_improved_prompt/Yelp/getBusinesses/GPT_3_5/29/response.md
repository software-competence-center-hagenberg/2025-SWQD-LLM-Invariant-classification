## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides a GET endpoint for retrieving businesses.
- The response schema includes a 'businesses' array, with each item containing a 'location' object.
- The 'location' object has an 'address1' field of type string and a 'display_address' field of type array containing strings.

## Invariant
- The invariant is: return.location.address1 in return.location.display_address[]
- This means that the 'address1' value from the 'location' object should be present in the 'display_address' array.

## Analysis
- We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 2543 examples in the requests data, with 1642 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided include instances where the 'address1' value is present in the 'display_address' array, supporting the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/businesses/search' has a GET operation with a parameter 'open_at' of type integer.
- The response schema includes a field 'total' of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.open_at > return.total

## Analysis
Based on the provided data, we have tried 10000 calls on the API and did not find a single counterexample. We found 1542 examples in the requests data, with 1296 of them being distinct examples. The values of 'input.open_at' and 'return.total' in the examples support the invariant.

The invariant makes semantic sense in the context of the API, as it compares the 'open_at' parameter (presumably a timestamp) with the 'total' field in the response, which represents the total number of businesses. There is no explicit contradiction in the API specification that would invalidate this invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the semantic coherence of the variables involved, the invariant 'input.open_at > return.total' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/businesses/search"
  get:
    summary: Get businesses
    description: Get businesses
    parameters:
      - name: open_at
        in: query
        required: false
        type: integer
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Get businesses
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            total:
              type: integer


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.open_at > return.total

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 1542 examples in the requests data, with 1296 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.open_at=1663974183; return.total=196
input.open_at=1664026575; return.total=57
input.open_at=1663789862; return.total=1
input.open_at=1663878553; return.total=0
input.open_at=1664105753; return.total=0

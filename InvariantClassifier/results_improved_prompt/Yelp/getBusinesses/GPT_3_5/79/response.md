## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/businesses/search" has a GET method with a parameter named "radius" of type integer and a maximum length of 40000.
- The response schema includes a field "businesses" which is an array of objects, each containing a field "review_count" of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the input radius is not equal to the return review_count.

## Analysis
Based on the provided data, we have tried 10000 calls on the API and found 82494 examples in the requests data, with 71196 of them being distinct examples. The examples show that for each request with a specific input radius, the return review_count is different. This aligns with the invariant that input.radius != return.review_count.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent results, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

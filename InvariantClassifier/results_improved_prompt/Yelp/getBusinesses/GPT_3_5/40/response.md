## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/businesses/search" has a GET method with a parameter named "attributes" of type array in the query.
- The response schema includes a field "businesses" which contains an array of objects with a field "location" that contains a field "display_address" of type array of strings.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a comparison between the size of the input array "attributes" and the size of the array "return.businesses.location.display_address" in the response.
- The invariant states that the size of the input array minus 1 should be less than or equal to the size of the array in the response.

## Analysis
- We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 193 examples in the requests data, with 193 of them being distinct examples.
- The example values of the variables show different values for the input attributes and the corresponding display addresses in the response.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples we have collected.
- The comparison between the sizes of the arrays is a valid and meaningful operation in this context.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a true-positive as it holds for all the examples we have collected, and the comparison is meaningful in the context of the API specification.

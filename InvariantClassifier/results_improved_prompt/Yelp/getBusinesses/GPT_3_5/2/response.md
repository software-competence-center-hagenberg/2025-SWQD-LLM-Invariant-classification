## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/businesses/search' is a GET request to retrieve businesses.
- The response schema includes a field 'businesses' which is an array of objects, each containing a 'coordinates' field.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.coordinates != null', which means that the 'coordinates' field in each business object should not be null.

## Analysis
- Given the response schema, the 'coordinates' field is expected to be present in each business object, and it should not be null.
- The invariant is consistent with the expected structure of the response, and it makes sense semantically.
- The extensive testing of 10000 calls did not find a single counterexample, indicating a high degree of confidence in the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing, the invariant 'return.coordinates != null' is classified as a true-positive.

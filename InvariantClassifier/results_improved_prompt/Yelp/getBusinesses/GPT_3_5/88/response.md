## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a REST endpoint for getting businesses, with a response schema that includes a field 'rating' within the 'businesses' array.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.rating >= 1.0', which means that the rating in the response must be greater than or equal to 1.0.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- There are 157707 examples in the requests data, with 9 distinct examples.
- The example values of the 'rating' field in the response range from 1.0 to 4.5, all of which satisfy the invariant.
- The invariant is a lower bound check on the 'rating' field, and the examples confirm that the 'rating' values are always greater than or equal to 1.0.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, the invariant 'return.rating >= 1.0' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

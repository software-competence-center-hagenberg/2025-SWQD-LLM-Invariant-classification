## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/businesses/search" has a GET method with a parameter named "price" in the query.
- The response schema includes a field "businesses" which contains an array of objects with a field "location".
- The field "location" contains a field "display_address" which is an array of strings.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a comparison between the size of the input parameter "price" array and the size of the "display_address" array in the response.
- The invariant states that the size of the input parameter "price" array minus 1 should be less than or equal to the size of the "display_address" array in the response.

## Analysis
- We have tried 100 calls on the API and did not find a single counterexample to the invariant.
- There are 768 examples in the requests data, with 513 distinct examples.
- The example values of the variables show a correlation between the size of the input parameter "price" array and the size of the "display_address" array in the response.
- The examples provide evidence that the invariant holds for the given API.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the evidence from the examples, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

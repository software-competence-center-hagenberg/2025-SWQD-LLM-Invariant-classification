## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides a GET endpoint for retrieving businesses.
- The response body contains an array of businesses, each with coordinates (including longitude) and a distance.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.coordinates.longitude < return.distance

## Analysis
- We have tried 50 calls on the API and found 892 examples in the requests data, with 858 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the invariant holds true for all the examples.
- The invariant makes semantic sense as it compares the longitude of the coordinates to the distance.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the values of longitude or distance that would contradict the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant return.coordinates.longitude < return.distance is likely a true-positive. The extensive testing and the semantic coherence of the invariant with the API's response support this conclusion.

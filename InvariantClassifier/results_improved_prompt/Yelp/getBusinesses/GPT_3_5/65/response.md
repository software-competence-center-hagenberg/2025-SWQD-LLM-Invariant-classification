## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a REST endpoint for getting businesses, with a response schema containing a field 'country' within the 'location' object.

## Invariant
- The invariant is LENGTH(return.location.country)==2, indicating that the length of the 'country' string in the response should always be 2.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample, with 184055 examples in the requests data.
- The examples show that the 'country' values are consistently 2 characters in length.
- The invariant is consistent with the response data and holds true for all the examples.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: true-positive
- Confidence: 0.95

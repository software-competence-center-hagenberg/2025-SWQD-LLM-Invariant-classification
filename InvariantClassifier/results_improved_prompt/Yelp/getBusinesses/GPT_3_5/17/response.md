## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/businesses/search' has a 'get' operation with a 'limit' query parameter.
- The response schema includes an array of 'categories' within the 'businesses' array.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.limit >= size(return.categories[])

## Analysis
- We have tried 50 calls on this API and found 387 distinct examples, all of which satisfy the invariant.
- The examples show that for each request, the 'limit' parameter is greater than or equal to the size of the 'categories' array in the response.
- The examples provide a diverse range of values for 'input.limit' and 'return.businesses.categories', indicating that the invariant holds for various inputs and responses.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the size of the 'categories' array, and the invariant makes semantic sense in the context of the API.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the semantic coherence of the invariant with the API specification, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a REST endpoint for getting businesses, with a response body containing an array of businesses, each with coordinates including a latitude field.

## Invariant
The invariant is `return.coordinates.latitude != 0`, which specifies that the latitude of the coordinates for each business in the response must not be equal to 0.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample, indicating that the invariant holds for all valid requests.
- We found 184055 examples in the requests data, with 59599 distinct examples, demonstrating that the invariant is consistently satisfied across a large number of calls.
- The examples provided also show that the latitude values are all non-zero, supporting the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the large number of examples, along with the absence of counterexamples, the invariant `return.coordinates.latitude != 0` is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides the structure of the API endpoint `/businesses/search`.
- The response schema includes a field `businesses` which is an array of objects.
- Each object in the `businesses` array has two fields: `distance` and `rating`, both of type number.

## Invariant
- The invariant is `return.distance > return.rating`, where `return` refers to the fields in the response body.
- This invariant checks if the `distance` value is greater than the `rating` value for each object in the `businesses` array.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided examples, the invariant `return.distance > return.rating` holds true for all 100 calls made to the API.
- The examples provided demonstrate that the `distance` values are consistently greater than the `rating` values in the response.
- The invariant is consistent with the semantics of the fields in the response body and does not contradict the API specification.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the provided examples, the invariant `return.distance > return.rating` is classified as a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is high due to the large number of examples and the consistency of the invariant with the API response structure.

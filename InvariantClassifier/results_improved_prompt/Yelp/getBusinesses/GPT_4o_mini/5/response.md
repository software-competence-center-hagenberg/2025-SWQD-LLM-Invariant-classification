### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the endpoint `/businesses/search` returns a response with a property `businesses`, which is an array of objects. Each object in this array has a property `is_closed`, which is of type boolean. This means that `is_closed` can take on two possible values: `true` or `false`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.is_closed == false`, implying that the `is_closed` property can only be `false` for all returned business objects.

### Analysis
1. **Boolean Nature of `is_closed`:** Since `is_closed` is a boolean, it can logically take on both values: `true` and `false`. 
2. **Swagger Definition:** The Swagger definition does not restrict the `is_closed` property to only `false`. It explicitly allows for both `true` and `false` values.
3. **Empirical Evidence:** While the invariant has been tested against 100 calls without finding a counterexample, the fact that there is only one distinct example found among 2574 examples suggests that while `false` may be common, it is not the only possible value. The presence of `true` as a valid state is implied by the boolean type.
4. **Semantic Context:** The invariant restricts the possible values of `is_closed` to only one value (`false`), which contradicts the nature of a boolean variable that can have two states.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the `is_closed` property to only `false`, while the Swagger definition allows for both `true` and `false`, this invariant is a **false-positive**. The empirical evidence does not negate the possibility of `is_closed` being `true`, thus the invariant does not hold universally for the API's response.

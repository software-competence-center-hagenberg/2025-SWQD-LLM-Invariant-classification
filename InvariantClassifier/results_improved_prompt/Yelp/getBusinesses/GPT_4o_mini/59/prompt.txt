Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/businesses/search"
  get:
    summary: Get businesses
    description: Get businesses
    parameters:
      - name: categories

    responses:
      '200':

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: size(input.categories[])-1 <= size(return.businesses[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntLessEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of <= between two long scalars. Prints as x <= y.

Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

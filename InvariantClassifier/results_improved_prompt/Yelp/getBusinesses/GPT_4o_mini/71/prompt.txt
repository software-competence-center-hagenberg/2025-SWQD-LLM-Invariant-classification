Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/businesses/search"
  get:
    summary: Get businesses
    description: Get businesses
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Get businesses
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            businesses:
              type: array
              items:
                coordinates:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    latitude:
                      type: number
              items:
                distance:
                  type: number


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.coordinates.latitude != return.distance

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.FloatNonEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two double scalars. Prints as x != y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "businesses" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 183163 examples in the requests data, with 66081 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.businesses.coordinates.latitude=37.76115; output.businesses.distance=185.1346063375654

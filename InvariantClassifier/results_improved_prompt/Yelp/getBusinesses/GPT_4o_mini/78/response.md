### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for searching businesses. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `businesses`, which is an array of objects. Each object in this array has a `location` property, which itself is an object containing a `display_address` property. The `display_address` is defined as an array of strings.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of `return.location.display_address[]` must be greater than or equal to 1, meaning that every response must contain at least one address in the `display_address` array.

### Analysis
- The invariant is based on the observation that in 10,000 calls, no counterexamples were found, and there are 181,481 examples with 93,771 distinct examples of the `display_address` array.
- The examples provided show that each `display_address` array contains multiple strings, indicating that addresses are consistently returned.
- However, the invariant does not take into account the possibility of an empty `display_address` array. The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `display_address` must contain at least one entry; it only states that it is an array of strings. Therefore, it is possible that there could be cases where the `display_address` array is empty.
- Since the invariant is a lower bound condition (size >= 1), it is crucial to ensure that the API specification guarantees that this condition will always hold. The absence of counterexamples in the tested calls does not definitively prove that the invariant is universally true, especially if the specification does not enforce this requirement.

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition does not explicitly guarantee that `display_address` will always contain at least one entry, the invariant is likely a false-positive. While the empirical evidence from the calls suggests that it holds true in the tested cases, the lack of specification guarantees means that it cannot be classified as a true-positive with certainty. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with a confidence of **0.85** due to the strong empirical evidence but the lack of explicit specification support.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/businesses/search"
  get:
    summary: Get businesses
    description: Get businesses
    parameters:
      - name: radius
        in: query
        required: false
        type: integer
        maxLength: 40000
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Get businesses
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            businesses:
              type: array
              items:
                location:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    display_address:
                      type: array
                      items:
                        type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.radius > size(return.location.display_address[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "businesses" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 103084 examples in the requests data, with 87939 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.radius=29570; output.businesses.location.display_address=["7600 SW 57th Ave","Ste 211","Miami, FL 33143"]
input.radius=28053; output.businesses.location.display_address=["30 Little La Trobe St","Melbourne Victoria 3000","Australia"]
input.radius=7993; output.businesses.location.display_address=["10 Rue Printemps","31000 Toulouse","Francia"]
input.radius=37652; output.businesses.location.display_address=["4640 Telegraph Ave","Oakland, CA 94609","United States"]

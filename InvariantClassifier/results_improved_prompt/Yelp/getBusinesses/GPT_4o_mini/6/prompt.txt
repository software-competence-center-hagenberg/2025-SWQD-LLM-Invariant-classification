Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/businesses/search"
  get:
    summary: Get businesses
    description: Get businesses
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Get businesses
        schema:

          properties:
            businesses:

              items:
                review_count:
                  type: integer


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.review_count >= 1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.LowerBound
Invariant description: Represents the invariant x >= c, where c is a constant and x is a long scalar.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "businesses" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 184055 examples in the requests data, with 3475 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.businesses.review_count=3161
output.businesses.review_count=4490
output.businesses.review_count=3164
output.businesses.review_count=3162
output.businesses.review_count=3150

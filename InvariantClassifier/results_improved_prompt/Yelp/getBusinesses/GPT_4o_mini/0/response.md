### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for searching businesses. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `businesses`, which is an array of items. Each item in this array has a property `categories`, which is also an array of objects with properties `alias` and `title`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.categories != null`, which implies that the `categories` property of each business in the response should not be null.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The response structure indicates that `categories` is an array. In JSON, an array can be empty but cannot be null if it is defined as an array type. Therefore, if `categories` is present in the response, it will either be an array (which can be empty) or it will not be included at all.
2. **Testing**: The fact that 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample suggests that in practice, the API consistently returns non-null values for `categories`. This strengthens the argument that the invariant holds true.
3. **Specification Compliance**: The invariant does not contradict the specification provided in the Swagger definition. Since `categories` is defined as an array, it should not be null according to the JSON schema rules.

### Conclusion
Given the structure of the response and the testing results, the invariant `return.categories != null` is likely a true-positive. It aligns with the expected behavior of the API as per the Swagger definition, and the extensive testing without counterexamples supports this conclusion.

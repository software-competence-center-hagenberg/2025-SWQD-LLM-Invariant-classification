### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies a GET endpoint at `/businesses/search` that returns a response with a `total` property of type integer. The response is expected to be an object containing this integer value.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.total >= 0`, which means that the `total` value in the response should always be greater than or equal to zero.

### Analysis
Given that the `total` property is defined as an integer in the Swagger definition, it is reasonable to expect that it could be zero or a positive integer. The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found, indicating that every response returned a `total` value that met the invariant condition. Additionally, the presence of 11,650 examples in the request data, with 1,008 distinct examples, further supports the reliability of this invariant. There is no indication in the Swagger definition that `total` could be negative, and the nature of counting businesses suggests that a negative count would not make sense semantically.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the Swagger definition, the nature of the `total` property, and the extensive testing conducted without finding counterexamples, the invariant `return.total >= 0` is classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the lack of counterexamples and the logical consistency of the invariant with the API's purpose.

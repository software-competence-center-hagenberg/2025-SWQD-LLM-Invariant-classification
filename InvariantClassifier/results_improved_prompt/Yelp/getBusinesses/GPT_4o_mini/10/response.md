### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for searching businesses. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `businesses`, which is an array of objects. Each object in this array has a `location` property, which itself is an object containing a `display_address` property. The `display_address` is defined as an array of strings.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.location.display_address != null`, meaning that the `display_address` property should not be null in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: According to the Swagger definition, `display_address` is an array of strings. In JSON, an array can be empty but cannot be null. Therefore, it is expected that `display_address` will always be an array, which means it cannot be null.
2. **Testing Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample. This strong empirical evidence suggests that the invariant holds true for the API's current implementation.
3. **Specification Compliance**: The specification does not indicate that `display_address` can be null, which aligns with the invariant's assertion.

### Conclusion
Given the structure of the response as per the Swagger definition and the extensive testing that has not yielded any counterexamples, the invariant `return.location.display_address != null` is a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is high due to the lack of counterexamples and the clear definition in the API specification.

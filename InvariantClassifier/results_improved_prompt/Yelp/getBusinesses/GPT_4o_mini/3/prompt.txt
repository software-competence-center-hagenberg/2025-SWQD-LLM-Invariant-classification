Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/businesses/search"
  get:
    summary: Get businesses
    description: Get businesses
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Get businesses
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            businesses:
              type: array
              items:
                coordinates:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    latitude:
                      type: number


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.coordinates.latitude != 0

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.NonZeroFloat
Invariant description: Represents double scalars that are non-zero. Prints as x != 0.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "businesses" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 184055 examples in the requests data, with 59599 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.businesses.coordinates.latitude=45.748696
output.businesses.coordinates.latitude=45.435352692107
output.businesses.coordinates.latitude=28.4717615663143
output.businesses.coordinates.latitude=34.14584
output.businesses.coordinates.latitude=48.859717545886

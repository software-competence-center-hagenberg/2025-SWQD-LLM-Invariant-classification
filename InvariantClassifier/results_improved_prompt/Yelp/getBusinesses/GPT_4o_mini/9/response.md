### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for searching businesses, which returns a response containing an array of businesses. Each business has a property called 'location', which is an object. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that 'return.location != null', indicating that the 'location' property of the returned businesses should never be null. 

### Analysis
Given that the invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, it suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true for the current implementation of the API. Additionally, the Swagger definition does not indicate that the 'location' can be null, nor does it provide any conditions under which it might be null. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the API is designed to ensure that the 'location' property is always present in the response. 

### Conclusion
Based on the evidence from the testing and the absence of any contradictory information in the Swagger definition, the invariant 'return.location != null' can be classified as a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is high due to the extensive testing conducted without finding any counterexamples.

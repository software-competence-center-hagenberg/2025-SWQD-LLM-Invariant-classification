Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/businesses/search"
  get:
    summary: Get businesses
    description: Get businesses
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Get businesses
        schema:

          properties:
            businesses:
              type: array
              items:
                distance:
                  type: number
              items:
                rating:
                  type: number


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.distance > return.rating

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.FloatGreaterThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two double scalars. Prints as x > y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "businesses" in the response body.

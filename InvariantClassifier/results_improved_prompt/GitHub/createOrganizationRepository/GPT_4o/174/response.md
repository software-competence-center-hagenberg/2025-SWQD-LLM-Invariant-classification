### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is used to create a new repository within a specified organization. The response schema includes a `url` field and a `contents_url` field, both of which are strings representing URLs related to the created repository.

- **`url`**: Represents the URL of the repository.
- **`contents_url`**: Represents the URL to access the contents of the repository, with a placeholder `{+path}` indicating that additional path information can be appended.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.url` is a substring of `return.contents_url`.

### Analysis
- **Example Values**: The example values provided show that `return.url` is indeed a substring of `return.contents_url`. This is consistent across all examples provided.
- **Number of Calls**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a high likelihood that the invariant holds true.
- **Distinct Examples**: Out of 11,650 examples, 9,696 are distinct, indicating a wide variety of test cases.
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `url` represents the base URL of the repository, while `contents_url` is an extension of this URL to access specific contents within the repository. It is logical for the base URL to be a substring of the contents URL, as the latter is a more specific endpoint derived from the former.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic relationship between `url` and `contents_url`, the extensive testing with no counterexamples, and the logical structure of the URLs, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive." The invariant aligns with the expected structure of URLs in a REST API for repositories, where the contents URL is an extension of the base repository URL.

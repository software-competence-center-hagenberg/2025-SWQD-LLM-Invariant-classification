### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is used to create a new repository within a specified organization. The operation requires authentication, and the user must be a member of the organization. The response for a successful creation (HTTP 201) includes a JSON object representing the repository, which contains a `contents_url` property.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.contents_url` is always a URL.

### Analysis
- **Swagger Specification**: The `contents_url` is defined as a string in the response schema. The example provided in the Swagger documentation (`http://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/contents/{+path}`) is a URL.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 11,650 examples were collected, with 9,696 distinct values, all of which were URLs.
- **Semantic Consistency**: The `contents_url` is intended to be a URL pointing to the contents of the repository, as indicated by its name and the example provided.

### Conclusion
Given the empirical evidence from a large number of tests and the semantic alignment with the Swagger definition, it is highly likely that `return.contents_url` is always a URL. The invariant aligns with the intended use and definition of the `contents_url` property in the API response.

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive** with high confidence.

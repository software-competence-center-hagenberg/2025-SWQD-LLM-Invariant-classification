### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` with the `POST` method is used to create a new repository within a specified organization. The response schema includes a `url` and a `hooks_url`, both of which are strings representing URLs related to the created repository.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.url` is a substring of `return.hooks_url`. This implies that the URL of the repository should be a part of the URL for the repository's hooks.

### Analysis
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `url` represents the main URL of the repository, while `hooks_url` is the URL for accessing the hooks of that repository. It is logical for the `hooks_url` to be an extension of the `url`, as hooks are a feature of the repository.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 11,650 examples supporting this invariant, with 9,696 distinct examples.
- **Example Analysis**: The provided examples consistently show that `return.url` is indeed a substring of `return.hooks_url`, as the `hooks_url` is simply the `url` with `/hooks` appended.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic relationship between a repository's URL and its hooks URL, along with the extensive empirical evidence supporting the invariant, it is highly likely that this invariant is a true-positive. The invariant aligns with the expected structure of URLs in GitHub's API, where the hooks URL is an extension of the repository URL.

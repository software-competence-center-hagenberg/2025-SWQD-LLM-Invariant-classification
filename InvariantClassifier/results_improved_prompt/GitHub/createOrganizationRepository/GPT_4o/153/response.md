### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is used to create a new repository within a specified organization. The response includes a `full_name` and an `ssh_url` for the created repository. The `full_name` is a string representing the repository's name in the format `owner/repo-name`, and the `ssh_url` is a string representing the SSH URL for accessing the repository, typically in the format `git@github.com:owner/repo-name.git`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.full_name` is a substring of `return.ssh_url`. This means that the repository's full name should appear within its SSH URL.

### Analysis
1. **Format Consistency**: The SSH URL format `git@github.com:owner/repo-name.git` inherently includes the `owner/repo-name` structure, which is exactly what `full_name` represents. Therefore, `full_name` being a substring of `ssh_url` is consistent with the expected format of these fields.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: With 10,000 calls made and no counterexamples found, alongside 11,650 examples supporting the invariant, there is strong empirical evidence that this invariant holds true.

3. **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant makes semantic sense as the `full_name` is a key component of the `ssh_url`, which is used to uniquely identify and access the repository.

### Conclusion
Given the format of the SSH URL and the role of `full_name` within it, combined with the extensive empirical evidence supporting the invariant, it is highly likely that this invariant is a true-positive. The invariant aligns with both the expected format and semantics of the data returned by the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is used to create a new repository within a specified organization. The authenticated user must be a member of the organization. The response, upon successful creation of the repository, includes a JSON object representing the repository, which contains properties for both `owner` and `organization`, each having a `received_events_url`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.owner.received_events_url == return.organization.received_events_url`

This invariant suggests that the `received_events_url` for the `owner` of the repository is always the same as the `received_events_url` for the `organization`.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: 
   - The `owner` in the context of a repository is typically the user or organization that owns the repository. In the case of an organization repository, the `owner` is likely the organization itself.
   - The `organization` field in the response is expected to represent the organization in which the repository is created.
   - Given this context, it makes semantic sense that the `received_events_url` for both `owner` and `organization` would be the same, as they both refer to the same entity (the organization).

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample.
   - There are 11,650 examples supporting the invariant, with 8 distinct examples, all showing equality between the two URLs.

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The swagger definition does not explicitly state that the `owner` and `organization` are different entities in this context. Instead, it is consistent with the idea that they could be the same, especially given the nature of organization repositories.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic alignment, the empirical evidence from a large number of calls, and the lack of specification contradiction, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant logically follows from the context of the API and the data observed.

**Confidence**: 0.95

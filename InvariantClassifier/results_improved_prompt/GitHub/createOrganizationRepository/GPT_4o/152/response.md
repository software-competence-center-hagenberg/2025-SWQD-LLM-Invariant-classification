### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` with the `POST` method is used to create a new repository within a specified organization. The response, upon successful creation of the repository, returns a status code `201` and includes a JSON object representing the repository. This object contains properties such as `full_name` and `git_url`.

- **`full_name`**: A string representing the full name of the repository, typically in the format `owner/repo-name`.
- **`git_url`**: A string representing the URL to access the repository via git, typically in the format `git://github.com/owner/repo-name.git`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.full_name` is a substring of `return.git_url`.

### Analysis

Given the structure of the `git_url`, it includes the `full_name` as part of its path. The `git_url` is constructed by appending the `full_name` to the base git URL (`git://github.com/`). Therefore, it is expected that `full_name` will always be a substring of `git_url`.

The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 11,650 examples were observed, with 9,696 being distinct, all supporting the invariant.

### Conclusion

The invariant logically holds due to the construction of the `git_url` which inherently includes the `full_name`. The extensive testing and the number of examples without any counterexamples further support the validity of this invariant.

**Verdict**: The invariant is a "true-positive".

**Confidence**: Given the logical reasoning and extensive testing, the confidence in this classification is very high.

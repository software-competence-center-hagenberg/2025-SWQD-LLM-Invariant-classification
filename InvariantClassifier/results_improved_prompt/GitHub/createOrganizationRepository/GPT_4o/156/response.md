### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is used to create a new repository in a specified organization. The response includes a `201` status code with a response body that contains information about the repository, including the `owner` object. The `owner` object has a `following_url` property, which is a string that includes a URL template for the user's following list.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.owner.url` is a substring of `return.owner.following_url`. This suggests that the URL of the owner is a part of the URL used to access the list of users they are following.

### Analysis
- **Data Analysis**: We have 10,000 calls with no counterexamples and 11,650 examples supporting the invariant, with 8 distinct examples. This high number of supporting examples and the absence of counterexamples strongly suggests that the invariant holds.
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `following_url` is a template URL for accessing the list of users that the owner is following. It makes semantic sense for the `owner.url` to be a part of this URL, as it identifies the user whose following list is being accessed.
- **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not provide any indication that the `following_url` would deviate from this pattern. The example URLs provided in the Swagger documentation also support this structure.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic consistency, the high number of supporting examples, and the absence of counterexamples, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant logically follows from the structure of the URLs as described in the Swagger documentation and observed in the data.

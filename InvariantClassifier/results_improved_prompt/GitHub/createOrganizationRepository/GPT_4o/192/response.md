### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is used to create a new repository within a specified organization. The response schema includes a `url` and a `pulls_url`, both of which are strings. The `url` represents the main URL of the repository, while `pulls_url` represents the URL for pull requests related to the repository.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.url` is a substring of `return.pulls_url`.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: 
   - The `url` represents the base URL of the repository.
   - The `pulls_url` represents the URL for accessing pull requests, which logically extends the base URL by appending `/pulls{/number}` to it.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found.
   - There are 11,650 examples supporting this invariant, with 9,696 distinct examples.
   - Example values show that `return.url` is indeed a substring of `return.pulls_url` in all cases.

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The swagger specification does not provide any counter-indication that `pulls_url` would not be an extension of `url`.
   - The examples provided in the swagger definition align with the invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic understanding of the URL structures, the empirical evidence from a large number of examples, and the lack of any specification details contradicting this relationship, it is highly likely that this invariant is a true-positive. The invariant logically follows from the structure of the URLs as described in the API documentation and observed in the examples.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  post:
    summary: Create an organization repository
    description: Creates a new repository in the specified organization. The authenticated user must be a member of the organization.
    
    **OAuth scope requirements**
    
    When using [OAuth](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/), authorizations must include:
    
    *   `public_repo` scope or `repo` scope to create a public repository. Note: For GitHub AE, use `repo` scope to create an internal repository.
    *   `repo` scope to create a private repository
    parameters:
    requestBody:
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            merge_commit_title:
              type: string
    responses:
      '201':
        description: Creates a new repository in the specified organization. The authenticated user must be a member of the organization.

              type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.merge_commit_title == return.merge_commit_title

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StringEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two String scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 6547 examples in the requests data, with 2 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 2 example values of the variables:
input.merge_commit_title=MERGE_MESSAGE; return.merge_commit_title=MERGE_MESSAGE
input.merge_commit_title=PR_TITLE; return.merge_commit_title=PR_TITLE

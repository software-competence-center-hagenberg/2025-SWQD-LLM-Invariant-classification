### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is used to create a new repository within a specified organization. The response for a successful creation (HTTP 201) includes a JSON object representing the repository. Among the properties of this object are `url` and `blobs_url`. The `url` is a direct link to the repository, while `blobs_url` is a templated URL for accessing blobs within the repository.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.url` is a substring of `return.blobs_url`.

### Analysis
- **Response Structure**: The `url` field represents the base URL of the repository, while `blobs_url` is a URL template for accessing blobs, which includes the base URL followed by `/git/blobs{/sha}`.
- **Example Values**: The examples provided show that `return.url` is indeed a substring of `return.blobs_url`, as the `blobs_url` is constructed by appending a specific path to the `url`.
- **Number of Calls and Examples**: With 10,000 calls and 11,650 examples, including 9,696 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant, it strongly suggests that this relationship holds consistently.

### Conclusion
Given the structure of the URLs and the consistent pattern observed across a large number of examples, the invariant that `return.url` is a substring of `return.blobs_url` is highly likely to be a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the expected URL structure as described in the API documentation and observed in the examples.

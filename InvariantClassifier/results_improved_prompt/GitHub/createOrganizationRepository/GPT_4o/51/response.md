### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is used to create a new repository within a specified organization. The response schema includes properties such as `html_url` and `svn_url`, both of which are strings representing URLs.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.html_url == return.svn_url`, which suggests that the `html_url` and `svn_url` fields in the response are always equal.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Definition**: The swagger definition does not explicitly state that `html_url` and `svn_url` should be equal. However, it does not contradict this invariant either.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: We have 10,000 calls to this API without a single counterexample, and 11,650 examples where the invariant holds, with 9,696 distinct examples. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

3. **Semantic Analysis**: The `html_url` and `svn_url` are both URLs pointing to the repository. In many systems, these URLs might be different if they serve different purposes (e.g., one for web access and another for SVN access). However, in this case, the examples show that they are identical, which might indicate that the system is configured to use the same URL format for both access types.

4. **Contextual Consideration**: Given that GitHub has moved away from SVN support in favor of Git, it is plausible that both URLs are now standardized to be the same, reflecting the same repository access point.

### Conclusion

Given the empirical evidence and the lack of contradiction in the swagger definition, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant seems to hold consistently across a large number of examples, and there is no specification detail that suggests otherwise.

**Confidence**: 0.95

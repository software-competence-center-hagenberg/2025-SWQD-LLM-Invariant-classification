### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` with a `POST` method is designed to create a new repository within a specified organization. The response, upon successful creation (HTTP status 201), includes a JSON object representing the repository. Among the properties of this object are `url` and `releases_url`. The `url` is a direct link to the repository, while `releases_url` is a link to the releases of the repository, with a placeholder for specific release IDs.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.url` is a substring of `return.releases_url`. This implies that the base URL of the repository is contained within the URL for accessing its releases.

### Analysis
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `url` and `releases_url` are closely related. The `url` represents the base repository URL, while `releases_url` extends this URL to point to the releases endpoint of the same repository. It is logical for the base URL to be a substring of the releases URL, as the latter is a more specific endpoint derived from the former.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 11,650 examples were observed, with 9,696 distinct examples supporting the invariant.
- **Specification Consistency**: The Swagger documentation does not specify any variations in the URL structure that would contradict this invariant. The structure of GitHub API URLs typically follows a consistent pattern, reinforcing the likelihood of this invariant being true.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic relationship between the `url` and `releases_url`, the extensive empirical evidence supporting the invariant, and the lack of any specification details that would suggest otherwise, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant logically follows from the URL structure of the GitHub API, where specific endpoints are extensions of base URLs.

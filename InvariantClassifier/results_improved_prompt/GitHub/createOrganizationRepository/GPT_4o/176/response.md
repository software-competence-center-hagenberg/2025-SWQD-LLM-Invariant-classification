### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is used to create a new repository within a specified organization. The response includes a JSON object representing the repository, with fields such as `url` and `deployments_url`. The `url` field provides the URL to access the repository, while `deployments_url` provides the URL to access the deployments of the repository.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.url` is a substring of `return.deployments_url`.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `url` field represents the base URL of the repository.
   - The `deployments_url` field represents the URL for the deployments of the repository, which typically extends the base URL with an additional path (e.g., `/deployments`).
   - Given the structure of URLs, it is logical that the base URL (`url`) would be a substring of any extended URL (`deployments_url`) that pertains to the same resource, as the latter builds upon the former.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found.
   - There are 11,650 examples supporting the invariant, with 9,696 distinct examples.
   - The examples provided show consistent adherence to the invariant, where the `url` is indeed a substring of the `deployments_url`.

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The Swagger specification does not contradict this invariant. It is consistent with the typical RESTful API design where resource-specific URLs extend from a base URL.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic reasoning, the empirical evidence from a large number of examples, and the lack of contradiction in the specification, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant logically follows from the structure of the URLs as described in the API documentation and observed in the examples.

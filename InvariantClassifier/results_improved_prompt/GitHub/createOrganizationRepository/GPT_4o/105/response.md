### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is used to create a new repository within a specified organization. The response schema includes a property `blobs_url`, which is described as a string. The example given in the Swagger definition is `http://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/git/blobs{/sha}`, which is a URL.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.blobs_url is Url`, which suggests that the `blobs_url` field in the response is always a URL.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Definition**: The example provided in the Swagger definition is indeed a URL, and it follows the pattern of GitHub API URLs, which typically include the base URL followed by specific paths.

2. **Test Data**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 11,650 examples in the requests data, with 9,696 distinct examples, all of which are URLs.

3. **Semantic Context**: The `blobs_url` is meant to be a URL pointing to the blobs resource of a repository, which aligns with the invariant's claim that it is always a URL.

4. **Specification Compliance**: The specification does not mention any other format for `blobs_url`, and the example provided supports the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the extensive testing and the alignment of the invariant with both the example in the Swagger definition and the semantic meaning of `blobs_url`, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant makes sense in the context of the API, and there is no evidence to suggest otherwise.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` with a `POST` method is used to create a new repository within a specified organization. The response schema includes a `full_name` and an `html_url` property. The `full_name` is a string representing the repository's full name, typically in the format `owner/repo-name`. The `html_url` is a string representing the URL to access the repository on GitHub, typically in the format `https://github.com/owner/repo-name`.

### Invariant

The invariant states that `return.full_name` is a substring of `return.html_url`.

### Analysis

Given the typical structure of a GitHub repository URL, the `full_name` (which is in the format `owner/repo-name`) is indeed a substring of the `html_url` (which is in the format `https://github.com/owner/repo-name`). This is because the URL includes the `full_name` as part of its path.

The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Furthermore, 11,650 examples were found, with 9,696 being distinct, all supporting the invariant.

### Conclusion

The invariant is consistent with the expected structure of GitHub repository URLs and the `full_name` property. Given the large number of examples and the absence of counterexamples, it is highly likely that this invariant is a true-positive.

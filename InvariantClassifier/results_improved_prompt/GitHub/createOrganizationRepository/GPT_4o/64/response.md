### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is used to create a new repository in a specified organization. The response includes a property `default_branch`, which is a string representing the default branch of the repository. The example given in the Swagger definition for `default_branch` is `master`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.default_branch == "main"`, suggesting that the default branch for every created repository is `main`.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Example vs. Invariant**: The Swagger definition provides an example of `default_branch` as `master`, which directly contradicts the invariant that states the default branch is `main`. This suggests that the default branch can be `master`, and not necessarily `main`.

2. **Number of Calls and Examples**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, the Swagger definition explicitly provides an example that contradicts the invariant.

3. **Common Practices**: While `main` has become a more common default branch name in recent times, especially with GitHub's initiative to move away from `master`, the Swagger definition still lists `master` as an example, indicating that it is a valid and possible default branch name.

4. **Semantic Context**: The `default_branch` is a configurable property, and its value can vary based on user settings or organizational policies. It is not inherently fixed to `main` unless explicitly set by the user or organization.

### Conclusion

Despite the large number of calls without counterexamples, the Swagger definition's example of `master` as a possible value for `default_branch` suggests that the invariant is not universally true. The invariant `return.default_branch == "main"` is likely a "false-positive" because it does not account for the possibility of `master` or other branch names being used as the default branch.

**Confidence**: 0.8

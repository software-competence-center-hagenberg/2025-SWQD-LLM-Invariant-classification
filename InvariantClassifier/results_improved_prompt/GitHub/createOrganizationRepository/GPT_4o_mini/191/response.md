### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes an API endpoint for creating a repository in a specified organization. The response includes two properties: `url` and `notifications_url`. The `url` represents the API endpoint for the created repository, while `notifications_url` provides a URL for notifications related to that repository.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.url` is a substring of `return.notifications_url`. This means that the URL of the repository should be part of the notifications URL.

### Analysis
1. **Structure of URLs**: The examples provided show that the `notifications_url` is constructed by appending `/notifications{?since,all,participating}` to the `url`. This indicates that the `url` is indeed a substring of `notifications_url` since the base URL of the repository is included in the notifications URL.
2. **Testing Results**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which strongly suggests that this relationship holds consistently across different requests.
3. **Distinct Examples**: The presence of 9,696 distinct examples further supports the idea that this invariant is robust and not a coincidence.

### Conclusion
Given the structure of the URLs as defined in the API and the extensive testing that has not yielded any counterexamples, the invariant that `return.url` is a substring of `return.notifications_url` is classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the consistent results across a large number of calls.

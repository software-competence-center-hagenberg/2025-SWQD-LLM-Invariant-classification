### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes an API endpoint for creating a repository within an organization. The response includes two fields: `url` and `statuses_url`. The `url` field represents the direct link to the repository, while `statuses_url` provides a link to the statuses of the repository, which includes a placeholder `{sha}` for a specific commit hash.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.url` is a substring of `return.statuses_url`. This means that the URL of the repository should always be part of the URL that leads to its statuses.

### Analysis
1. **Structure of URLs**: Based on the examples provided, the `statuses_url` is constructed by appending `/statuses/{sha}` to the `url`. This is consistent across all examples, where the `url` is indeed a substring of `statuses_url`. 
2. **Testing and Examples**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample. Additionally, there are 11,650 examples in the request data, with a significant number being distinct. This suggests a strong correlation between the two fields.
3. **Semantic Validity**: The relationship between `url` and `statuses_url` is semantically valid, as it is logical for the statuses of a repository to be accessed via a URL that includes the repository's base URL.
4. **Specification Compliance**: The Swagger definition does not contradict the invariant, as it does not specify any cases where `url` would not be a substring of `statuses_url`.

### Conclusion
Given the strong evidence from the testing and the logical structure of the URLs, the invariant that `return.url` is a substring of `return.statuses_url` is likely a true-positive. There is no indication from the specification or the examples that this relationship would be violated. 

**Verdict**: true-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

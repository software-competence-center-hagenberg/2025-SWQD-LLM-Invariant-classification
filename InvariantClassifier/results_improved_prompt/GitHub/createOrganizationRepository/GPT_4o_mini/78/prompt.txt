Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  post:
    summary: Create an organization repository
    description: Creates a new repository in the specified organization. The authenticated user must be a member of the organization.
    
    **OAuth scope requirements**
    
    When using [OAuth](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/), authorizations must include:
    
    *   `public_repo` scope or `repo` scope to create a public repository. Note: For GitHub AE, use `repo` scope to create an internal repository.
    *   `repo` scope to create a private repository
    parameters:
    requestBody:
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            team_id:
              type: integer
              description: The id of the team that will be granted access to this repository. This is only valid when creating a repository in an organization.
    responses:

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.team_id < return.owner.id

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntLessThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of < between two long scalars. Prints as x < y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 16 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.team_id=6693166; output.owner.id=114466716
input.team_id=6685561; output.owner.id=114399782
input.team_id=6683758; output.owner.id=114363728
input.team_id=6677556; output.owner.id=114227816
input.team_id=6683756; output.owner.id=114363728

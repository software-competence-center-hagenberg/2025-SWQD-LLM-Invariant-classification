### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an API endpoint for creating a repository in an organization. The response includes two properties: `url` and `contributors_url`. The `url` property provides the URL of the created repository, while the `contributors_url` property provides the URL to access the contributors of that repository.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.url` is a substring of `return.contributors_url`. This means that the URL of the repository should always be part of the URL that points to the contributors of that repository.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Relationship**: The `contributors_url` is constructed by appending `/contributors` to the `url`. This indicates a clear semantic relationship where the `url` is indeed a part of the `contributors_url`. 
2. **Examples**: The provided examples support the invariant, as each `url` is consistently found as a substring within the corresponding `contributors_url`. 
3. **Testing**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which strongly suggests that the invariant holds true across a wide range of inputs.
4. **Specification Support**: The specification does not contradict this invariant, as it clearly defines how the `contributors_url` is derived from the `url`.

### Conclusion
Given the strong semantic relationship between the two URLs, the extensive testing without counterexamples, and the lack of contradictory information in the specification, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the substantial evidence supporting the invariant.

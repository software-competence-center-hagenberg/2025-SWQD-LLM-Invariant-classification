Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  post:
    summary: Create an organization repository
    description: Creates a new repository in the specified organization. The authenticated user must be a member of the organization.
    
    **OAuth scope requirements**
    
    When using [OAuth](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/), authorizations must include:
    
    *   `public_repo` scope or `repo` scope to create a public repository. Note: For GitHub AE, use `repo` scope to create an internal repository.
    *   `repo` scope to create a private repository
    parameters:
    requestBody:
        schema:
          type: object
    responses:
      '201':
        description: Creates a new repository in the specified organization. The authenticated user must be a member of the organization.

        schema:
          type: object
          description: A git repository
          properties:
            created_at:
              type: string
              example: 2011-01-26T19:01:12Z
          properties:
            updated_at:
              type: string
              example: 2011-01-26T19:14:43Z


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.created_at == return.updated_at

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StringEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two String scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 150 examples in the requests data, with 100 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.created_at=2022-09-26T03:15:02Z; return.updated_at=2022-09-26T03:15:02Z
return.created_at=2022-09-27T02:30:17Z; return.updated_at=2022-09-27T02:30:17Z
return.created_at=2022-09-26T05:29:29Z; return.updated_at=2022-09-26T05:29:29Z
return.created_at=2022-09-25T19:10:08Z; return.updated_at=2022-09-25T19:10:08Z
return.created_at=2022-09-26T22:11:31Z; return.updated_at=2022-09-26T22:11:31Z

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  post:
    summary: Create an organization repository
    description: Creates a new repository in the specified organization. The authenticated user must be a member of the organization.
    
    **OAuth scope requirements**
    
    When using [OAuth](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/), authorizations must include:
    
    *   `public_repo` scope or `repo` scope to create a public repository. Note: For GitHub AE, use `repo` scope to create an internal repository.
    *   `repo` scope to create a private repository
    parameters:
    requestBody:
        schema:
          type: object
    responses:
      '201':
        description: Creates a new repository in the specified organization. The authenticated user must be a member of the organization.

          description: A git repository
          properties:
            full_name:
              type: string
              example: octocat/Hello-World
          properties:

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.full_name is a substring of return.git_url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString
Invariant description: Represents the substring invariant between two String scalars. Prints as x is a substring of y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 9696 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.full_name=outerHeaven1984/music-for; return.git_url=git://github.com/outerHeaven1984/music-for.git
return.full_name=antonioMarOrganization/network-ikeapark; return.git_url=git://github.com/antonioMarOrganization/network-ikeapark.git
return.full_name=cp92022/mining-sla; return.git_url=git://github.com/cp92022/mining-sla.git

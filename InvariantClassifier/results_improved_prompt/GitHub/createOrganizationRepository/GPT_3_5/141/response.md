## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint is a POST request to create a new repository in a specified organization.
- The response schema includes a property 'pushed_at' of type string with an example value in the format '2011-01-26T19:06:43Z'.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the length of the 'pushed_at' string in the response is always 20 characters.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the nature of the 'pushed_at' field, which represents a timestamp in ISO 8601 format, it is reasonable to expect that the length of the string will always be 20 characters. The examples provided also support this expectation.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a true-positive with high confidence.

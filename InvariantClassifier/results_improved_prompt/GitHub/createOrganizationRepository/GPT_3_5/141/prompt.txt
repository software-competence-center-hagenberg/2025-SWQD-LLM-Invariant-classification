Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  post:
    summary: Create an organization repository
    description: Creates a new repository in the specified organization. The authenticated user must be a member of the organization.
    
    **OAuth scope requirements**
    
    When using [OAuth](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/), authorizations must include:
    
    *   `public_repo` scope or `repo` scope to create a public repository. Note: For GitHub AE, use `repo` scope to create an internal repository.
    *   `repo` scope to create a private repository
    parameters:
    requestBody:
        schema:
          type: object
    responses:
      '201':
        description: Creates a new repository in the specified organization. The authenticated user must be a member of the organization.
        
        **OAuth scope requirements**

        *   `repo` scope to create a private repository
        schema:
          type: object
          description: A git repository
          properties:
            pushed_at:
              type: string
              example: 2011-01-26T19:06:43Z


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.pushed_at)==20

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 9437 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.pushed_at=2022-09-27T13:14:57Z
return.pushed_at=2022-09-26T23:08:47Z
return.pushed_at=2022-09-27T01:04:42Z
return.pushed_at=2022-09-26T01:17:47Z
return.pushed_at=2022-09-26T11:55:27Z

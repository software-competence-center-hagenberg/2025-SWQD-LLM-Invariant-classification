## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a POST request to create a new repository in a specified organization.
- The response schema includes the properties 'url' and 'comments_url', both of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that 'return.url' is a substring of 'return.comments_url'.

## Analysis
- The examples provided show that the 'return.url' is indeed a substring of 'return.comments_url' for all the tested cases.
- The examples are consistent with the nature of URLs, where the 'url' is typically a substring of the 'comments_url'.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints or limitations on the format of the 'url' and 'comments_url', which supports the validity of the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the large number of examples tested, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

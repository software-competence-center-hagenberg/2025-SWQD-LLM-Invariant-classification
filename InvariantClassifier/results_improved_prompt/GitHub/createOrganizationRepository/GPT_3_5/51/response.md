## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint is for creating a new repository in a specified organization, and the response contains the URLs for the created repository.
- The response body contains two string properties: `html_url` and `svn_url`.

## Invariant
The invariant is `return.html_url == return.svn_url`, which means that the `html_url` and `svn_url` in the response body are expected to be equal.

## Analysis
- The examples provided in the request data show that for each example, `html_url` and `svn_url` are indeed equal.
- The invariant has been tested with a large number of calls (10000) and no counterexamples have been found.
- The semantics of the variables `html_url` and `svn_url` in the context of a repository creation endpoint suggest that they should be equal, as they both represent URLs for the created repository.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided examples, the semantics of the variables, and the extensive testing, it is highly likely that the invariant `return.html_url == return.svn_url` is a true-positive.

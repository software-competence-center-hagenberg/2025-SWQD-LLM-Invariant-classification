Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  post:
    summary: Create an organization repository
    description: Creates a new repository in the specified organization. The authenticated user must be a member of the organization.
    
    **OAuth scope requirements**
    
    When using [OAuth](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/), authorizations must include:
    
    *   `public_repo` scope or `repo` scope to create a public repository. Note: For GitHub AE, use `repo` scope to create an internal repository.
    *   `repo` scope to create a private repository
    parameters:
    requestBody:
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            license_template:
              type: string
              description: Choose an [open source license template](https://choosealicense.com/) that best suits your needs, and then use the [license keyword](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/#searching-github-by-license-type) as the `license_template` string. For example, "mit" or "mpl-2.0".
    responses:
      '201':
        description: Creates a new repository in the specified organization. The authenticated user must be a member of the organization.

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.license_template is a substring of return.license.url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString
Invariant description: Represents the substring invariant between two String scalars. Prints as x is a substring of y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 1188 examples in the requests data, with 31 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.license_template=bsd-3-clause; return.license.url=https://api.github.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause
input.license_template=bsd-3-clause-clear; return.license.url=https://api.github.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause-clear
input.license_template=bsl-1.0; return.license.url=https://api.github.com/licenses/bsl-1.0
input.license_template=eupl-1.1; return.license.url=https://api.github.com/licenses/eupl-1.1
input.license_template=afl-3.0; return.license.url=https://api.github.com/licenses/afl-3.0

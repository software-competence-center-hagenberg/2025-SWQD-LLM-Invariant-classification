### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that lists repositories for a specified organization. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `permissions` object with two boolean properties: `admin` and `triage`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.permissions.admin` is equal to `return.permissions.triage`, which implies that both permissions will always have the same boolean value (either both true or both false).

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The response structure allows for `admin` and `triage` to be independently set to either true or false. There is no indication in the Swagger definition that these two fields are inherently linked or should always have the same value.
2. **Counter Examples**: While the testing has not found any counter examples in 100 calls, this does not conclusively prove that the invariant holds for all possible responses. The fact that only 2 distinct examples were found among 3412 requests raises concerns about the diversity of the data.
3. **Boolean Independence**: The nature of boolean values suggests that they can be independently true or false. Unless explicitly stated in the API documentation that these two permissions are linked, it is reasonable to assume they can vary independently.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant suggests a strict equality between two independent boolean fields without any supporting evidence from the API specification, it is more likely to be a false-positive. The lack of diversity in the examples and the nature of boolean permissions lead to the conclusion that the invariant does not hold universally. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

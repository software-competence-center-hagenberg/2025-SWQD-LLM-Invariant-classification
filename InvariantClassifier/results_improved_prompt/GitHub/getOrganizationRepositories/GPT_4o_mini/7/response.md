### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that returns a list of repositories for a specified organization. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `permissions` object, which contains two boolean properties: `admin` and `push`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.permissions.admin` is equal to `return.permissions.push`. This means that the values of these two boolean properties should always be the same for every valid response from this endpoint.

### Analysis
1. **Boolean Properties**: The invariant compares two boolean values. In the examples provided, both `admin` and `push` are either `true` or `false`, and they are equal in the two examples given.
2. **Limited Examples**: While the invariant holds for the two examples provided, the fact that there are only two distinct examples raises a concern. The invariant could be coincidental rather than a rule that applies universally.
3. **Specification Clarity**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `admin` and `push` must be equal. It only describes the structure of the response. Therefore, it is possible that there are valid scenarios where `admin` and `push` can have different values.
4. **Counterexamples**: Although 100 calls did not yield counterexamples, this is a relatively small sample size compared to the potential variability in permissions for different repositories.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of explicit specification that `admin` and `push` must be equal and the limited examples provided, it is likely that the invariant is a false-positive. There may be valid cases where `admin` and `push` can differ, which would violate the invariant. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with a confidence of **0.75** due to the limited evidence supporting the invariant's universality.

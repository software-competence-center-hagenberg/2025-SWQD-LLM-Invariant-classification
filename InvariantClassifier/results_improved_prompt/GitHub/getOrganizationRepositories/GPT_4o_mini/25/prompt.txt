Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  get:
    summary: List organization repositories
    description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
    parameters:
      - name: per_page
        in: query
        description: Results per page (max 100).
        required: false
        type: integer
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
        schema:
          type: array
          properties:
            topics:
              type: array
              items:
                type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.per_page > size(return.topics[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 78 examples in the requests data, with 78 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.per_page=48; output.topics=["android-plugin","bytecode-manipulation"]
input.per_page=23; output.topics=["helix","openwhisk","serverless","tooling"]
input.per_page=17; output.topics=["chatops","crontab","flyte","flyte-pack","ifttt","workflows"]
input.per_page=26; output.topics=["stripe"]
input.per_page=26; output.topics=["demo","demo-app","instant-payouts","ios","marketplace","nodejs","payments","stripe","stripe-api","stripe-connect","swift"]

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that lists repositories for a specified organization. The parameter `org` is required and is a string that represents the organization name. The response is an array of repository objects, each containing a `full_name` property, which is a string formatted as `org/repo-name`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.org` is a substring of `return.full_name`. This means that the organization name provided in the request must appear within the full name of the repository returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that for any valid request to the endpoint, the organization name (`input.org`) should be part of the repository's full name (`return.full_name`). Given the format of `full_name` as `org/repo-name`, it is logical that the organization name should indeed be a substring of the full name.

2. **Testing and Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 50 calls without finding any counterexamples. Additionally, there are 1092 examples in the request data, with 983 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant. This substantial amount of data suggests a strong correlation between `input.org` and `return.full_name`.

3. **Specification Alignment**: The Swagger definition does not contradict the invariant. It explicitly states that the `full_name` is formatted as `org/repo-name`, which inherently means that `org` will always be a substring of `full_name`.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant holds true for the given API endpoint. The evidence from the tests and the alignment with the Swagger definition strongly supports that `input.org` is indeed a substring of `return.full_name` for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

**Verdict**: true-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  get:
    summary: List organization repositories
    description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
        schema:
          type: array
          properties:
            owner:
              type: object
              description: Simple User
              properties:
                avatar_url:
                  type: string
                  example: https://github.com/images/error/octocat_happy.gif


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.owner.avatar_url is Url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsUrl

Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 247727 examples in the requests data, with 41 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:

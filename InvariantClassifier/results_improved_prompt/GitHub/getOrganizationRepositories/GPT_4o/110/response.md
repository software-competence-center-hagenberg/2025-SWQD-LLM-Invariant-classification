### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is designed to list repositories for a specified organization. The response is an array of objects, each containing properties such as `full_name` and `html_url`. The `full_name` is a string representing the repository's name in the format `owner/repo-name`, and `html_url` is a string representing the URL to the repository on GitHub.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.full_name` is a substring of `return.html_url`.

### Analysis
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `full_name` represents the repository's name, which is typically included in the URL (`html_url`) of the repository on GitHub. The URL format for GitHub repositories is `https://github.com/{full_name}`, which naturally includes the `full_name` as a substring.
- **Empirical Evidence**: With 10,000 calls made and no counterexamples found, alongside 247,727 examples supporting the invariant, it strongly suggests that this invariant holds true.
- **Specification Consistency**: The Swagger definition and the examples provided align with the invariant. The `full_name` being a part of the `html_url` is consistent with the typical structure of GitHub URLs.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic consistency, the large number of supporting examples, and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant that `return.full_name` is a substring of `return.html_url` is a "true-positive". This invariant is consistent with the expected structure of GitHub repository URLs.

**Confidence**: 0.99

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is designed to list repositories for a specified organization. The response schema includes an array of objects, each containing a `url` and an `owner` object. The `owner` object has a `following_url` property, which is a string representing the URL for the following endpoint of the user.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.owner.url` is a substring of `return.owner.following_url`.

### Analysis
- **Data Analysis**: We have a large dataset with 10000 calls and 247727 examples, with 41 distinct examples. All examples provided show that `return.owner.url` is indeed a substring of `return.owner.following_url`.
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `return.owner.url` represents the URL of the user, while `return.owner.following_url` is the URL for the following endpoint of the same user. Given the structure of GitHub API URLs, it makes sense that the user URL would be a substring of the following URL, as the following URL is an extension of the user URL.
- **Specification Check**: The specification does not explicitly mention any other structure for these URLs, and the examples provided are consistent with the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the large number of examples and the semantic consistency with the GitHub API URL structure, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant logically follows from the structure of the URLs as described in the API documentation and observed in the examples.

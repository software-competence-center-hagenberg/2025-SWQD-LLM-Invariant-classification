### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is designed to list repositories for a specified organization. The response schema indicates that it returns an array of objects, each containing at least two properties: `name` and `full_name`. The `name` is a string representing the repository name, and `full_name` is a string that includes both the organization name and the repository name, formatted as `organization/repository`.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.name` is a substring of `return.full_name`.

### Analysis
- **Semantic Analysis**: Given the structure of `full_name` as `organization/repository`, it is logical that `name` (which represents the repository name) should always be a substring of `full_name`.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, yielding 247,727 examples without a single counterexample. This high volume of consistent data strongly supports the invariant.
- **Specification Consistency**: The swagger definition implies that `full_name` is constructed by concatenating the organization name and the repository name, separated by a slash. This construction inherently makes the repository name a substring of `full_name`.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.name is a substring of return.full_name` is consistent with the logical structure of the data as described in the swagger definition. The extensive empirical evidence further supports this conclusion. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a "true-positive" with high confidence.

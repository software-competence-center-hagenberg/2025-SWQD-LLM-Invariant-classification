### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is designed to list repositories for a specified organization. The response schema includes properties such as `html_url` and `svn_url`, both of which are strings. The `html_url` is typically used to provide a web URL to view the repository, while `svn_url` is used for accessing the repository via SVN.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.html_url == return.svn_url`, which suggests that the HTML URL and the SVN URL for a repository are always identical.

### Analysis
1. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 247,727 examples were collected, with 13,466 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.
2. **Semantic Consideration**: In practice, the `html_url` and `svn_url` often point to the same URL structure, especially for repositories hosted on platforms like GitHub, where the web URL and the SVN access URL can be identical.
3. **Specification Review**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that these URLs must be different or the same. However, given the context of GitHub repositories, it is reasonable to assume that these URLs could be the same, as observed in the examples.

### Conclusion
Given the extensive empirical evidence and the reasonable assumption based on the context of GitHub repositories, the invariant `return.html_url == return.svn_url` is likely a "true-positive". The lack of counterexamples across a large dataset further supports this conclusion. However, without explicit confirmation from the API documentation, there is a slight chance of variability in other contexts or future changes.

**Confidence**: 0.95

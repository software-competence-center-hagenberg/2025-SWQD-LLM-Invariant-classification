### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is designed to list repositories for a specified organization. The response schema is an array of objects, each containing a `url` and an `events_url`. The `url` is a string representing the repository URL, and `events_url` is a string representing the URL for the events related to that repository.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.url` is a substring of `return.events_url`.

### Analysis
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `url` represents the main URL of the repository, while `events_url` is specifically for events related to that repository. It makes semantic sense that the `events_url` would be an extension of the `url`, as it is a specific endpoint related to the repository.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 247,727 examples supporting this invariant, with 13,466 distinct examples.
- **Example Analysis**: The examples provided show that the `events_url` is indeed an extension of the `url`, with `/events` appended to the `url`. This pattern is consistent across all examples.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic relationship between `url` and `events_url`, the large number of examples supporting the invariant, and the absence of counterexamples, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant logically follows from the structure of the URLs as described in the Swagger definition and observed in the examples.

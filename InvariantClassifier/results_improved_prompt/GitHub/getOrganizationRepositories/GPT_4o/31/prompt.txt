We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 247727 examples in the requests data, with 14175 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.id=15057786; return.size=16398
return.id=447156991; return.size=43962
return.id=14329301; return.size=196
return.id=193791956; return.size=137

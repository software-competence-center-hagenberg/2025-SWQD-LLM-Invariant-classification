    description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':

              properties:
                avatar_url:
                  type: string
                  example: https://github.com/images/error/octocat_happy.gif


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.owner.avatar_url is Url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsUrl

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is designed to list repositories for a specified organization. The response schema indicates that each repository object contains a `url` and a `blobs_url`. The `url` is a direct link to the repository, while the `blobs_url` is a template URL for accessing blobs within the repository, with a placeholder for the SHA of the blob.

### Invariant
The invariant in question states that `return.url` is a substring of `return.blobs_url`. This implies that the base URL of the repository (`return.url`) should be contained within the `blobs_url`, which is a URL template for accessing blobs in the same repository.

### Analysis
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 247,727 examples supporting the invariant, with 13,466 distinct examples.
- **Example Analysis**: The provided examples show that `return.url` is indeed a substring of `return.blobs_url`. For instance, `https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/EPPO` is a substring of `https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/EPPO/git/blobs{/sha}`.
- **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant makes semantic sense because the `blobs_url` is an extension of the `url` with additional path components and a placeholder for blob SHA. This structure inherently makes the `url` a substring of `blobs_url`.

### Conclusion
Given the empirical evidence from a large number of calls and the semantic consistency of the invariant with the API's URL structure, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant logically follows from the way URLs are structured in the API response, and the absence of counterexamples further supports its validity.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is used to list repositories for a specified organization. The response schema is an array of objects, each containing at least two properties: `full_name` and `git_url`. The `full_name` is a string representing the name of the repository in the format `owner/repo-name`, and `git_url` is a string representing the URL to access the repository via the Git protocol.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.full_name` is a substring of `return.git_url`.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `full_name` typically represents the repository in the format `owner/repo-name`, while the `git_url` is a URL string that includes the repository's full name as part of the path. For example, a `git_url` like `git://github.com/owner/repo-name.git` will naturally contain the `full_name` `owner/repo-name` as a substring.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, and there are 247,727 examples supporting the invariant, with 13,466 distinct examples. This extensive empirical evidence strongly supports the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The swagger definition does not explicitly contradict this invariant. The format of `git_url` typically includes the `full_name` as part of the URL path, which aligns with the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic alignment between `full_name` and `git_url`, the extensive empirical evidence supporting the invariant, and the lack of any specification contradictions, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant logically follows from the structure of the `git_url` and `full_name` as described in the swagger definition and observed in the examples.

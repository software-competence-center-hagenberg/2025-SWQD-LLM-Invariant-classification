### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` is used to list repositories for a specified organization. The response is an array of objects, each containing a `url` and a `contents_url`. The `url` represents the API endpoint for the repository itself, while the `contents_url` represents the API endpoint for the contents of the repository, with a placeholder `{+path}` indicating that it can be expanded to access specific paths within the repository.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.url` is a substring of `return.contents_url`. This means that the base URL of the repository should be part of the URL used to access its contents.

### Analysis
- **Empirical Evidence**: We have 10,000 calls without a counterexample, and 247,727 examples supporting the invariant, with 13,466 distinct examples.
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `contents_url` is logically an extension of the `url`, as it is used to access specific contents within the repository. The placeholder `{+path}` in `contents_url` suggests that it builds upon the base `url` to form a more specific endpoint.
- **Specification Consistency**: The swagger definition does not contradict this invariant. The example values provided in the swagger definition and the examples from the data support the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the large number of examples supporting the invariant and the logical relationship between `url` and `contents_url`, it is highly likely that this invariant is a true-positive. The invariant aligns with the expected structure of URLs in the API, where `contents_url` is an extension of `url` to access specific contents.

**Verdict**: True-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

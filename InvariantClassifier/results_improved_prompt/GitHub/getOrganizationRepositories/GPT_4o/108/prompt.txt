Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  get:
    summary: List organization repositories
    description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
    parameters:
      - name: org
        in: path
        required: true
        type: string
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
        schema:
          type: array
          properties:
            html_url:
              type: string
              example: https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.org is a substring of return.owner.html_url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString
Invariant description: Represents the substring invariant between two String scalars. Prints as x is a substring of y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 43 examples in the requests data, with 24 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.org=cloudflare; return.owner.html_url=https://github.com/cloudflare
input.org=github; return.owner.html_url=https://github.com/github
input.org=stripe; return.owner.html_url=https://github.com/stripe
input.org=guardian; return.owner.html_url=https://github.com/guardian
input.org=newrelic; return.owner.html_url=https://github.com/newrelic

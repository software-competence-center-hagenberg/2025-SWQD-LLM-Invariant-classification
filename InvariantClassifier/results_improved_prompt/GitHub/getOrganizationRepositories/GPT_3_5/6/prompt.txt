          type: array
          properties:
            open_issues_count:
              type: integer

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.open_issues_count == return.open_issues

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two long scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 247727 examples in the requests data, with 498 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.open_issues_count=40; return.open_issues=40
return.open_issues_count=567; return.open_issues=567
return.open_issues_count=726; return.open_issues=726
return.open_issues_count=125; return.open_issues=125
return.open_issues_count=4; return.open_issues=4

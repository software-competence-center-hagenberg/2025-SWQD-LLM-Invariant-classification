This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  get:
    summary: List organization repositories
    description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
    parameters:
    responses:

Invariant: return.git_commits_url is Url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsUrl

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 247727 examples in the requests data, with 13466 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:

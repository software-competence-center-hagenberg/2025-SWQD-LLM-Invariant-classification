## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides a REST endpoint for listing organization repositories, with response fields 'full_name' and 'html_url'.

## Invariant
- The invariant is that 'return.full_name' is a substring of 'return.html_url'.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 247727 examples in the requests data, with 13466 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the 'full_name' values are indeed substrings of the corresponding 'html_url' values.

## Conclusion
- Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive.

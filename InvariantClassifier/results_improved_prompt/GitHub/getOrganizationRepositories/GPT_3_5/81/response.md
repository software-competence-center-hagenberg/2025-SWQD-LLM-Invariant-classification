- The swagger definition provides a path for listing organization repositories with a response schema containing a field 'keys_url' of type string.

## Invariant

## Analysis

- There are 247727 examples in the requests data, with 13466 distinct examples, all of which have the 'keys_url' field as a URL.
- The example values provided are all valid URLs.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the large number of examples, it is highly likely that the invariant 'return.keys_url is Url' is a true-positive.

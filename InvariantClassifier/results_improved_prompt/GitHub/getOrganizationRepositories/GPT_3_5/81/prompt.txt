Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  get:
    summary: List organization repositories
    description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
        schema:
          type: array
          properties:
            keys_url:
              type: string
              example: http://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/keys{/key_id}


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.keys_url is Url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsUrl
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable is always a URL. Represented as x is Url.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

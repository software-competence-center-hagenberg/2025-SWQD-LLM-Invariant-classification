## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/orgs/{org}/repos' has a GET operation that lists repositories for the specified organization.
- The response schema includes a property 'node_id' of type string with an example value.

## Invariant
- The invariant is LENGTH(return.license.node_id)==16, indicating that the 'node_id' in the response always has a fixed length of 16.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- There are 196148 examples in the requests data, with 33 distinct examples.
- The example values of 'node_id' in the response are all of length 16.
- The specification does not explicitly mention other possible lengths for 'node_id'.
- The invariant is a fixed-length string invariant, and the examples support the claim that 'node_id' always has a length of 16.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, the invariant LENGTH(return.license.node_id)==16 is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

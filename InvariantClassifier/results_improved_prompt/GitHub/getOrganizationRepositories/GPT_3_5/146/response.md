## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provides a summary and description of the endpoint, along with the parameters and responses.

## Invariant
The invariant states that `return.url` is a substring of `return.labels_url`.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the nature of URLs, it is reasonable to assume that the `return.url` will always be a substring of `return.labels_url`. This is because the `labels_url` is a more specific URL that includes the `url` as a substring. The examples provided also support this assumption, and the large number of calls and distinct examples further strengthen the case for this invariant.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a true-positive with high confidence.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  get:
    summary: List organization repositories
    description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
        schema:
          type: array
          properties:
            full_name:
              type: string
              example: octocat/Hello-World
          properties:
            ssh_url:
              type: string

Invariant: return.full_name is a substring of return.ssh_url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString
Invariant description: Represents the substring invariant between two String scalars. Prints as x is a substring of y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 247727 examples in the requests data, with 13466 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.full_name=google/gfbuild-swiftshader; return.ssh_url=git@github.com:google/gfbuild-swiftshader.git
return.full_name=square/anvil; return.ssh_url=git@github.com:square/anvil.git
return.full_name=guardian/trump-tracker; return.ssh_url=git@github.com:guardian/trump-tracker.git
return.full_name=github/welcome-to-github; return.ssh_url=git@github.com:github/welcome-to-github.git
return.full_name=cfpb/consumerfinance.gov; return.ssh_url=git@github.com:cfpb/consumerfinance.gov.git

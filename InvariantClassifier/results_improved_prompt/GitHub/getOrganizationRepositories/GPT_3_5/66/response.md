## Invariant
The invariant specifies that the 'comments_url' field in the response is always a URL.

## Analysis
Based on the provided data, 10000 calls were made to the API, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 247727 examples in the requests data, with 13466 distinct examples, all of which have 'comments_url' values that are valid URLs.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the large number of examples, it is highly likely that the invariant 'return.comments_url is Url' is a true-positive. The data provides strong evidence that the 'comments_url' field in the response is always a URL, and there is no indication in the specification that contradicts this invariant.

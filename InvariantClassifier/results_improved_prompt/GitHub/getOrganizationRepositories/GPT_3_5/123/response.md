## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/orgs/{org}/repos' returns a list of repositories for the specified organization.
- The response schema includes the 'html_url' field for each repository.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that 'return.owner.html_url' is a substring of 'return.html_url'.
- This means that the 'html_url' of the owner is a substring of the 'html_url' of the repository.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- There are 247727 examples in the requests data, with 13466 distinct examples.
- The example values provided also support the invariant, showing that the 'html_url' of the owner is indeed a substring of the 'html_url' of the repository.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, it is highly likely that the invariant 'return.owner.html_url' is a substring of 'return.html_url' is a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is very high.

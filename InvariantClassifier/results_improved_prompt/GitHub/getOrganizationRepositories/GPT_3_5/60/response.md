## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a response schema where the 'url' field is of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the 'return.url' is always a URL.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on the API and found 247727 examples in the requests data, with 13466 distinct examples, all of which have the 'return.url' as valid URLs.
- The examples provided are valid URLs and match the expected format.
- The swagger definition does not explicitly contradict the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistency of the examples with the invariant, it is classified as a true-positive.

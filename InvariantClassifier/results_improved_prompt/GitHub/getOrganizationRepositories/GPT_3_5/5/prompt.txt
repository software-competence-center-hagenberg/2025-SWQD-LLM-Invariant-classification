Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 247727 examples in the requests data, with 1986 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.stargazers_count=395; return.watchers=395
return.stargazers_count=1130; return.watchers=1130
return.stargazers_count=27806; return.watchers=27806
return.stargazers_count=1729; return.watchers=1729
return.stargazers_count=344; return.watchers=344

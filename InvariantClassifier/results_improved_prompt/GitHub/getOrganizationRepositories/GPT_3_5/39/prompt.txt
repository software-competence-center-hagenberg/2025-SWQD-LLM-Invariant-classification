Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  get:
    summary: List organization repositories
    description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
        schema:
          type: array
          properties:
            size:
              type: integer
          properties:
            topics:
              type: array
              items:
                type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.size >= size(return.topics[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of >= between two long scalars. Prints as x >= y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 230 examples in the requests data, with 204 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.size=99; return.topics=["django","hacktoberfest","wagtail"]
return.size=92; return.topics=["aws","jenkins","sqs"]
return.size=44; return.topics=["ansible","redhat","sallite6"]
return.size=6806; return.topics=["production"]
return.size=187193; return.topics=["docker","git","golang","moby"]

- The invariant has been tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples have been found.
- There are 3412 examples in the requests data, with 819 distinct examples, indicating a substantial amount of data supporting the invariant.
- The examples provided also show that the 'id' of the owner is consistently greater than the 'forks_count' in the response.

## Conclusion

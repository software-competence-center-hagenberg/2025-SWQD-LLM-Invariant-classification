We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 1092 examples in the requests data, with 983 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.org=isa-group; return.full_name=isa-group/governify-project-oai-supervisor
input.org=docker; return.full_name=docker/go-plugins-helpers
input.org=uds-se; return.full_name=uds-se/androcov
input.org=twitter; return.full_name=twitter/util
input.org=newrelic; return.full_name=newrelic/render_component

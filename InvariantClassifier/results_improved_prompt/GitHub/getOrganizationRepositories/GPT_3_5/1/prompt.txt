Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  get:
    summary: List organization repositories
    description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':

        schema:
          type: array
          properties:
            owner:
              type: object
              description: Simple User
              properties:
                site_admin:

          properties:
            disabled:
              type: boolean


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.owner.site_admin == return.disabled

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two long scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 247727 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:
return.owner.site_admin=false; return.disabled=false

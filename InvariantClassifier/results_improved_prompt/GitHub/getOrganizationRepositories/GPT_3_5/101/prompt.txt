Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  get:
    summary: List organization repositories
    description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
        schema:
          type: array
          properties:
            created_at:
              type: string
              example: 2011-01-26T19:01:12Z


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.dates.IsTimestampYYYYMMHHThhmmssmm
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable is always a timestamp. Represented as x is Timestamp. Format
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 247727 examples in the requests data, with 13464 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.created_at=2014-07-02T17:05:55Z
return.created_at=2022-03-02T03:18:08Z
return.created_at=2017-04-28T21:22:47Z
return.created_at=2012-05-14T14:16:18Z
return.created_at=2012-11-12T16:55:08Z

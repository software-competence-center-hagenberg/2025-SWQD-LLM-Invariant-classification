## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/orgs/{org}/repos" has a GET operation that lists repositories for the specified organization.
- The response schema includes two string properties: "url" and "statuses_url".

## Invariant
- The invariant is that the "url" property is a substring of the "statuses_url" property in the response.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- There are 247727 examples in the requests data, with 13466 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the "url" property is indeed a substring of the "statuses_url" property for each example.
- The invariant type is daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString, which specifically represents the substring invariant between two String scalars.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples provided, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

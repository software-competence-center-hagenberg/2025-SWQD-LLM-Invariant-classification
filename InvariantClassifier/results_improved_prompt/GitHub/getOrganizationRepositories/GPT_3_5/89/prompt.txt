Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  get:
    summary: List organization repositories
    description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Lists repositories for the specified organization.

          type: array
          properties:

              type: string
              example: http://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/stargazers


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.stargazers_url is Url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsUrl

Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.

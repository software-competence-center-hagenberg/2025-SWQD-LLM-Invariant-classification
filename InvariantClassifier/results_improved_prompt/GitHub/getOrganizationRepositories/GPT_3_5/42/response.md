## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint is a GET request to list organization repositories.
- It takes an optional query parameter 'per_page' to specify the number of results per page, with a maximum value of 100.
- The response is an array of repositories.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the value of 'per_page' in the request should be greater than or equal to the size of the array returned in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the swagger definition, the 'per_page' parameter is used to limit the number of results per page, and the response is a list of repositories. The invariant implies that the user should request at least as many repositories as are returned in the response, which contradicts the purpose of pagination.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive. It contradicts the intended use of the 'per_page' parameter for pagination, and it does not align with the expected behavior of the API. Therefore, the invariant is not correct for this REST API.

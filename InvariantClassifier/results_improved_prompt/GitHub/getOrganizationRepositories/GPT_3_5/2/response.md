## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a GET request to list organization repositories.
- The response schema includes two properties: html_url and svn_url, both of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a StringEqual invariant, checking if the html_url is equal to the svn_url in the response.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 247727 examples in the requests data, with 13466 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the html_url and svn_url are different for each repository, indicating that the invariant is a false-positive.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for the valid requests on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provides information about the REST endpoint and the structure of the response.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the field `return.owner.following_url` is always a URL.

## Analysis
We have tried 10000 calls on the API and found 247727 examples in the requests data, with 41 distinct examples. All of these examples have the field `return.owner.following_url` with values that are valid URLs. Additionally, the swagger definition provides an example of the `following_url` field which is a valid URL.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the information from the swagger definition, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The field `return.owner.following_url` consistently contains valid URL values, and there is no evidence to suggest otherwise. Therefore, the verdict is true-positive with high confidence.

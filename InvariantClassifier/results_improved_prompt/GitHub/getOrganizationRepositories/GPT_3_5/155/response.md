- The response schema includes two string properties: 'url' and 'subscribers_url'.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.url is a substring of return.subscribers_url

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- We found 247727 examples in the requests data, with 13466 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided also show that the 'url' is indeed a substring of the 'subscribers_url' for each response.
- The invariant type is daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString, which specifically represents the substring invariant between two String scalars.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples provided, it is highly likely that the invariant 'return.url is a substring of return.subscribers_url' is a true-positive for this REST API endpoint.

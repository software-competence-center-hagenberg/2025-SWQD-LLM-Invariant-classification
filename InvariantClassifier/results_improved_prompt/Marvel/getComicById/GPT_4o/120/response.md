## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have `textObjects` and `urls` arrays. 

- **textObjects**: An array of descriptive text blurbs for the comic, each with properties like `type`, `language`, and `text`.
- **urls**: An array of public website URLs related to the comic, each with properties like `type` and `url`.

## Invariant

The invariant in question is `size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.urls[])`, which suggests that for each comic resource returned, the number of text objects is less than or equal to the number of URLs.

## Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: 
   - **textObjects**: These are descriptive texts about the comic, which could include solicit texts, preview texts, etc.
   - **urls**: These are URLs related to the comic, which could include links to purchase, view, or learn more about the comic.

   It is plausible that a comic could have multiple URLs (e.g., purchase link, preview link, official site link) while having fewer text descriptions.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 100 calls were made, and no counterexamples were found.
   - 96 examples were observed, with 63 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The specification does not explicitly contradict this invariant. It is reasonable to assume that comics might have more URLs than text objects due to the nature of online resources and marketing.

## Conclusion

Given the semantic plausibility, the empirical evidence from 100 calls without counterexamples, and the lack of contradiction in the specification, the invariant `size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.urls[])` is likely a true-positive. The invariant aligns with the typical structure of comic metadata, where multiple URLs are common for a single comic resource.

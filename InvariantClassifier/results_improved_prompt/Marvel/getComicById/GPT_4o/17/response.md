### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this `results` array can have a `textObjects` array, which contains descriptive text blurbs for the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.textObjects != null`, which implies that for every comic fetched, the `textObjects` array is not null.

### Analysis

1. **Response Structure**: According to the swagger definition, `textObjects` is an array within each item of the `results` array. The definition does not explicitly state that `textObjects` can be null, but it is a common practice in REST APIs to return an empty array instead of null when there are no items to display.

2. **Test Results**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong likelihood that `textObjects` is consistently non-null, possibly defaulting to an empty array when there are no text blurbs.

3. **Semantic Considerations**: The `textObjects` field is meant to provide additional descriptive information about the comic. It is reasonable to expect that this field is always present, even if it is empty, to maintain a consistent response structure.

### Conclusion

Given the large number of tests (10,000) without any counterexamples and the typical design patterns for REST APIs, it is highly likely that the invariant `return.textObjects != null` is a true-positive. The API seems to be designed to always include the `textObjects` array, even if it is empty, to ensure a consistent response format.

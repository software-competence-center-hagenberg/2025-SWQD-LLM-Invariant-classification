### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have `textObjects` and `dates` arrays. 

- **textObjects**: An array of objects, each containing a `type`, `language`, and `text`. These are descriptive text blurbs for the comic.
- **dates**: An array of objects, each with a `type` and `date`. These represent key dates for the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.dates[])-1`.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `textObjects` array contains descriptive text blurbs, which could vary in number depending on how much descriptive text is available for a comic.
   - The `dates` array contains key dates, which are likely to be more structured and consistent across comics (e.g., release date, last sale date, etc.).

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 100 calls were made to the API, and no counterexamples were found.
   - 96 examples were found where the invariant held, with 63 distinct examples.

3. **Logical Reasoning**:
   - Given the nature of `textObjects` as descriptive blurbs, it is plausible that there are fewer text blurbs than key dates, especially if each comic has a standard set of key dates.
   - The invariant suggests that the number of text blurbs is less than or equal to one less than the number of dates. This could be due to a standard pattern where each comic has a fixed number of dates, and text blurbs are optional or fewer.

### Conclusion

The invariant `size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.dates[])-1` appears to be a reasonable assumption based on the structured nature of `dates` and the optional nature of `textObjects`. The empirical evidence supports this invariant, as no counterexamples were found in 100 calls, and a significant number of examples were observed. Therefore, it is likely a true-positive invariant.

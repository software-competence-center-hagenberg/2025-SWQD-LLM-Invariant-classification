### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `data.results` array contains information about comics, including `collectedIssues` and `images`.

- **collectedIssues**: An array of issues collected in this comic. It is noted that this array will generally be empty for periodical formats such as "comic" or "magazine".
- **images**: An array of promotional images associated with the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`size(return.collectedIssues[])-1 != size(return.images[])`

This invariant suggests that the size of the `collectedIssues` array minus one is not equal to the size of the `images` array.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `collectedIssues` array is expected to be empty for many comics, especially periodicals. This means its size is often zero.
   - The `images` array contains promotional images, which can vary in number independently of `collectedIssues`.
   - There is no inherent semantic relationship between the number of collected issues and the number of images that would suggest they should be equal or have a specific numerical relationship.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 1000 calls were made to this API without finding a counterexample.
   - 37 examples were found, with 22 distinct examples supporting the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The specification does not provide any indication that the number of collected issues should relate to the number of images in any specific way.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic relationship between `collectedIssues` and `images`, and the empirical evidence supporting the invariant, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant is likely capturing a pattern that holds due to the independent nature of these two arrays in the context of the API's data model.

### Confidence

The confidence in this classification is high due to the combination of semantic analysis and empirical evidence.

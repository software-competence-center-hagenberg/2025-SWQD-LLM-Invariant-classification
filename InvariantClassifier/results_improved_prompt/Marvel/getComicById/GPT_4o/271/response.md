### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object with a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array contains a `stories` object with an `available` integer indicating the number of stories available, and a `collectedIssues` array which lists issues collected in the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.stories.available > size(return.collectedIssues[])`. This implies that the number of available stories is always greater than the number of collected issues in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Specification**: The specification mentions that `stories.available` is the total number of stories available, and `collectedIssues` is generally empty for periodical formats like comics or magazines. This suggests that `collectedIssues` might often be zero or a small number, especially for periodicals.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 1000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 39 examples were found where the invariant held true, with 23 distinct examples. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

3. **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant compares the number of available stories to the size of the collected issues array. Given that `collectedIssues` is often empty or small, it makes sense that `stories.available` could be greater, especially if `stories.available` represents a larger set of stories related to the comic.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.stories.available > size(return.collectedIssues[])` appears to be consistent with the API's behavior as described in the Swagger definition and supported by empirical evidence. The semantic relationship between the number of available stories and the collected issues also supports this invariant. Therefore, it is likely a "true-positive" invariant.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response for a successful request (HTTP 200) includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `digitalId` and a `collectedIssues` array. The `digitalId` is an integer representing the digital version of the comic, and it is 0 if the comic is not available digitally. The `collectedIssues` is an array of objects, each representing an issue collected in the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.digitalId >= size(return.collectedIssues[])`. This means that the digital ID of the comic should be greater than or equal to the number of collected issues in the comic.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `digitalId` is an identifier for the digital version of the comic, while `collectedIssues` is a list of issues included in the comic. There is no direct semantic relationship between the numeric value of a digital ID and the number of collected issues. The digital ID is not inherently related to the count of collected issues.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not mention any relationship between `digitalId` and `collectedIssues`. The `digitalId` being 0 indicates the comic is not available digitally, which does not correlate with the number of collected issues.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held true for 100 calls, which suggests a pattern, but given the lack of semantic connection, this might be coincidental.

### Conclusion

The invariant `return.digitalId >= size(return.collectedIssues[])` lacks a logical basis in the context of the API's specification. The digital ID and the number of collected issues are unrelated properties, and the invariant seems to be coincidental rather than a true reflection of the API's behavior. Therefore, despite the empirical evidence from 100 calls, the invariant is likely a false-positive due to the lack of semantic connection and specification support.

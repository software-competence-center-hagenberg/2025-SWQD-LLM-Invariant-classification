Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}"
  get:
    summary: Fetches a single comic by id.
    description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':

                  items:
                    prices:
                      type: array

                      items:
                        type:
                          type: string
                          description: A description of the price (e.g. print price, digital price).


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: "return.type one of { ""digitalPurchasePrice"", ""printPrice"" }"

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.OneOfString
Invariant description: Represents String variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results.prices" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 17843 examples in the requests data, with 2 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 2 example values of the variables:
return.data.results.prices.type=printPrice
return.data.results.prices.type=digitalPurchasePrice

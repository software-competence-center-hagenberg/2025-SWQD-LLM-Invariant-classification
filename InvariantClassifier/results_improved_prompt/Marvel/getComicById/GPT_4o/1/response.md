### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` which fetches a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `prices` array, where each price has a `type` field. The `type` field is described as a string that provides a description of the price, such as "print price" or "digital price".

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: "return.type one of { "digitalPurchasePrice", "printPrice" }". This invariant suggests that the `type` field in the `prices` array can only take on the values "digitalPurchasePrice" or "printPrice".

### Analysis

- **Number of Calls and Examples:** The invariant was tested over 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 17,843 examples were observed, with only 2 distinct values, which are "printPrice" and "digitalPurchasePrice".
- **Swagger Specification:** The Swagger definition does not explicitly list all possible values for the `type` field, but it does mention examples like "print price" and "digital price". This aligns with the invariant's values "printPrice" and "digitalPurchasePrice".
- **Semantic Consistency:** The values "printPrice" and "digitalPurchasePrice" semantically match the descriptions provided in the Swagger definition, suggesting that these are indeed the intended values for the `type` field.

### Conclusion

Given the high number of calls and examples without any counterexamples, along with the semantic alignment between the invariant and the Swagger definition, it is highly likely that the invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant seems to accurately capture the intended use of the `type` field in the API response.

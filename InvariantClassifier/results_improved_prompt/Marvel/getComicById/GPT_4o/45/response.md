### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `stories` object with an `available` property. The `available` property is described as the number of total available stories in this list and is stated to always be greater than or equal to the "returned" value.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.stories.available >= 2`, which suggests that the `available` property for stories in the response is always greater than or equal to 2.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not explicitly state a minimum value for `available`, only that it is greater than or equal to the "returned" value. This implies that `available` could theoretically be any non-negative integer, including 0 or 1, if no stories are available or only one story is available.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 500 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 650 examples were observed, with 16 distinct values, all of which were greater than or equal to 2.

3. **Logical Consistency**: While the empirical evidence strongly supports the invariant, the specification does not provide a constraint that would logically enforce `available >= 2` in all cases. The absence of such a constraint in the specification suggests that the invariant might not hold universally, despite the lack of counterexamples in the tested calls.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of explicit constraints in the specification that would enforce `available >= 2` and the possibility that the API could return comics with fewer than 2 stories available, the invariant is likely a "false-positive". The empirical evidence is strong, but without a specification constraint, it cannot be guaranteed to hold in all cases.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has an `issueNumber`, which is described as "The number of the issue in the series (will generally be 0 for collection formats)."

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.issueNumber >= 0.0`. This invariant suggests that the `issueNumber` should always be greater than or equal to 0.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Description**: The description mentions that the `issueNumber` will generally be 0 for collection formats. This implies that 0 is a valid and expected value for certain formats, supporting the invariant that `issueNumber` is non-negative.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 500 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 650 examples were observed, with 149 distinct values, all supporting the invariant.

3. **Semantic Reasoning**: The `issueNumber` represents a position or identifier within a series, which logically should not be negative. Negative issue numbers do not make sense in the context of a comic series.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic context of `issueNumber`, the description in the Swagger documentation, and the empirical evidence from the tests, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant `return.issueNumber >= 0.0` is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of the API and the logical constraints of the data it represents.

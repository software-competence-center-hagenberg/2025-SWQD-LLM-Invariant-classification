### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have `events` and `images` properties. The `events` property has an `available` field, which is an integer representing the total number of available events. The `images` property is an array of objects, each representing an image with a `path` and `extension`.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.events.available <= size(return.images[])`. This suggests that the number of available events is always less than or equal to the number of images associated with a comic.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: 
   - The `events.available` field represents the number of events, while `images` is a list of promotional images. There is no inherent semantic relationship between the number of events and the number of images. These are two distinct aspects of a comic's metadata.
   - The invariant suggests a dependency or correlation between the number of events and images, which is not logically supported by the definition or typical use cases of comics metadata.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant held true for 1000 API calls without a counterexample, and there are 1588 examples supporting it, with 944 distinct examples.
   - Despite the empirical evidence, the lack of semantic correlation between events and images raises doubts about the invariant's validity as a true-positive.

3. **Specification Contradiction**:
   - The specification does not explicitly mention any relationship between the number of events and images. Therefore, the invariant seems to be coincidental rather than a rule enforced by the API logic.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.events.available <= size(return.images[])` is likely a **false-positive**. The lack of semantic correlation between the number of events and images, combined with the absence of specification support, suggests that the invariant is coincidental rather than a true rule of the API. The empirical evidence, while strong, does not outweigh the logical analysis.

**Confidence**: 0.7

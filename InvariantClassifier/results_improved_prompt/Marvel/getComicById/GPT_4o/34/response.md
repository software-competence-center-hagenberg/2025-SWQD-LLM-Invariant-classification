### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have an `images` array, which holds promotional images related to the comic. Each image object has properties like `path` and `extension`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.images != null`. This implies that for every comic fetched, the `images` array in the `results` is never null.

### Analysis

1. **Response Schema**: The schema specifies that `images` is an array of objects. However, it does not explicitly state whether this array can be empty or null.

2. **Test Data**: With 10,000 calls made to this endpoint without encountering a null `images` array, it suggests that the API consistently returns a non-null `images` array.

3. **Semantic Context**: The `images` array is described as a list of promotional images associated with the comic. While it is logical for a comic to have promotional images, the schema does not explicitly guarantee that every comic will have images.

4. **Specification Gaps**: The swagger definition does not explicitly state that `images` cannot be null. However, the absence of null values in extensive testing suggests a strong pattern.

### Conclusion

Given the extensive testing and the logical expectation that comics typically have promotional images, the invariant `return.images != null` appears to be a "true-positive". However, the lack of explicit specification in the swagger definition introduces a slight uncertainty.

**Verdict**: True-positive

**Confidence**: 0.85

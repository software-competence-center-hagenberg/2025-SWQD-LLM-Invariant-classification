### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `stories` object with two integer properties:

- `available`: The total number of available stories for the comic.
- `returned`: The number of stories actually returned in the response, with a maximum of 20.

The documentation explicitly states that `available` will always be greater than or equal to `returned`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.stories.available >= return.stories.returned`.

### Analysis

- **Documentation Support**: The swagger definition explicitly states that the `available` count will always be greater than or equal to the `returned` count. This is a direct support for the invariant.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 11,500 examples were observed, with 47 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.
- **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant makes semantic sense given the context of the API. The `available` count represents the total number of stories, while `returned` represents a subset of those stories, up to a maximum of 20.

### Conclusion

Given the explicit mention in the documentation that `available` will always be greater than or equal to `returned`, the large number of examples supporting the invariant, and the lack of any counterexamples, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant is consistent with the documented behavior of the API and the observed data.

**Confidence**: 1.0

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema specifies that the `data.results` field is an array, which contains information about comics. Each comic in this array has a `dates` field, which is also an array containing objects with `type` and `date` properties.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.dates != null`. This invariant suggests that the `dates` array in the response is never null.

### Analysis

1. **Response Schema**: According to the schema, `dates` is defined as an array. There is no explicit mention in the schema that `dates` can be null. Typically, in JSON, an array can be empty but not null unless explicitly stated.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

3. **Semantic Context**: The `dates` field is described as "A list of key dates for this comic." It is reasonable to assume that a comic would have some associated dates, even if the list is empty, rather than null.

4. **Specification Ambiguity**: The specification does not explicitly state that `dates` can be null. In REST APIs, it is common for arrays to be empty rather than null if there are no items to return.

### Conclusion

Given the schema definition, the semantic context, and the empirical evidence from 10,000 calls without a counterexample, it is highly likely that the invariant `return.dates != null` is a true-positive. The invariant aligns with typical REST API design practices where arrays are empty rather than null when there are no items.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have `textObjects` and `dates` arrays. 

- **textObjects**: An array of objects, each containing a `type`, `language`, and `text`. These represent descriptive text blurbs for the comic.
- **dates**: An array of objects, each containing a `type` and `date`. These represent key dates for the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`size(return.textObjects[])-1 <= size(return.dates[])-1`

This translates to:

`size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.dates[])`

### Analysis

1. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

2. **Distinct Examples**: Out of 7,702 examples, 5,082 were distinct, indicating a wide variety of data was tested.

3. **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant suggests that the number of `textObjects` is always less than or equal to the number of `dates`. This could make sense if each text object is associated with a specific date or if the number of dates naturally exceeds the number of text objects due to the nature of comic metadata (e.g., multiple key dates like release, reprint, etc.).

4. **Specification Check**: The swagger definition does not explicitly state any constraints on the relationship between `textObjects` and `dates`. However, the lack of counterexamples in a large dataset suggests that this relationship might be an implicit rule or a common pattern in the data.

### Conclusion

Given the large number of calls and the absence of counterexamples, combined with the plausible semantic relationship between `textObjects` and `dates`, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a "true-positive". The invariant seems to reflect a consistent pattern in the data, even if not explicitly documented in the API specification.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` that fetches a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object with a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array has properties including `pageCount` (an integer representing the number of story pages in the comic) and `collectedIssues` (an array of issues collected in the comic).

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.pageCount >= size(return.collectedIssues[])`. This invariant suggests that the number of story pages in the comic (`pageCount`) is greater than or equal to the number of collected issues (`collectedIssues[]`).

### Analysis

- **Semantic Analysis**: The `pageCount` represents the number of pages in a comic, while `collectedIssues` is an array of issues collected in the comic. Semantically, it makes sense that a comic could have more pages than the number of issues it collects, especially if each issue is represented by a single page or if the comic includes additional content beyond the collected issues.
- **Swagger Definition**: The definition does not explicitly contradict the invariant. It describes `collectedIssues` as generally being empty for periodical formats, which suggests that `pageCount` could often be greater than the size of `collectedIssues`.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held true for 100 calls without a counterexample. While 100 calls is not an exhaustive test, it provides some empirical support for the invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic alignment of the invariant with the description of the fields, the lack of contradiction in the Swagger definition, and the empirical evidence from 100 calls, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a "true-positive." However, the confidence is not absolute due to the limited number of calls tested.

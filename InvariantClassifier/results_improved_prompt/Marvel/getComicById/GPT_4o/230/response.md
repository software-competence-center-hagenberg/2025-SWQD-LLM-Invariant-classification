### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response, when successful (HTTP 200), includes a `data` object containing `results`, which is an array of comics. Each comic has a `characters` object with an `available` integer indicating the number of characters available, and a `collectedIssues` array listing issues collected in the comic.

- **characters.available**: This integer represents the total number of characters available in the comic.
- **collectedIssues**: This array contains issues collected in the comic, typically empty for periodicals.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.characters.available > size(return.collectedIssues[])`

This invariant suggests that the number of available characters in a comic is always greater than the number of collected issues in that comic.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `characters.available` field represents a count of characters associated with the comic.
   - The `collectedIssues` array represents issues collected in the comic, which can be empty for certain formats.

2. **Logical Consistency**:
   - It is plausible that a comic could have more characters than collected issues, especially since collected issues are often empty for periodicals.
   - The invariant does not contradict the provided swagger definition, as there is no explicit mention of a relationship between characters and collected issues.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant held true across 100 calls without a counterexample, suggesting a consistent pattern.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic context and the empirical evidence from 100 calls, the invariant appears to be logically consistent with the API's behavior. The lack of counterexamples further supports the likelihood that this invariant is a true-positive. However, the invariant is not explicitly guaranteed by the swagger definition, so there remains a small possibility of encountering a counterexample in a broader dataset.

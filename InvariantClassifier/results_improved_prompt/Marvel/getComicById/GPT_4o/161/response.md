### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its unique ID. The response schema includes a `data` object with properties `total` and `results`. The `total` property is described as the total number of resources available given the current filter set, while `results` is an array of comics returned by the call.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.data.total == size(return.data.results[])`, which suggests that the total number of resources (`total`) should equal the number of items in the `results` array.

### Analysis
1. **Response Schema Understanding**: The `total` field is described as the total number of resources available given the current filter set. In the context of fetching a single comic by ID, this would typically mean that `total` should be 1, as the request is for a specific comic.

2. **Results Array**: The `results` array should contain the comic resource that matches the `comicId` provided in the request. Therefore, it is expected that the `results` array should also contain exactly one item, matching the `total` value of 1.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: With 10,000 calls made and no counterexamples found, along with 11,650 examples supporting the invariant, there is strong empirical evidence that this invariant holds true.

4. **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant makes semantic sense given the endpoint's purpose of fetching a single comic by ID. The `total` should logically match the size of the `results` array since both are expected to represent the same singular resource.

### Conclusion
Given the endpoint's purpose, the response schema, and the empirical evidence from a large number of calls, the invariant `return.data.total == size(return.data.results[])` is consistent with the expected behavior of the API. Therefore, it is classified as a "true-positive" invariant.

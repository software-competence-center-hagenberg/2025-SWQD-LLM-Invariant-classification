### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource based on the `comicId` provided in the path. The response includes a `data` object with a `results` array, which contains a list of comics. Each comic can have an `images` array, which lists promotional images associated with the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `input.comicId > size(return.images[])`. This suggests that the `comicId` provided in the request is always greater than the number of images returned in the `images` array for that comic.

### Analysis
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `comicId` is an identifier for a comic and is not semantically related to the number of images associated with that comic. The `comicId` is likely to be a unique identifier, possibly incrementing or assigned in a non-sequential manner, while the number of images is a separate attribute of the comic.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 11,247 examples supporting the invariant, with 7,352 distinct examples.
- **Specification Check**: The specification does not provide any direct correlation between `comicId` and the number of images. The invariant seems to be an incidental finding rather than a rule derived from the API's intended behavior.

### Conclusion
The invariant `input.comicId > size(return.images[])` does not have a logical basis in the API's design or documentation. The lack of counterexamples in 10,000 calls suggests it might hold true in practice, but this is likely due to the incidental nature of the data rather than a true invariant of the API. Therefore, it is classified as a "false-positive" because it lacks semantic justification and is not supported by the API's specification.

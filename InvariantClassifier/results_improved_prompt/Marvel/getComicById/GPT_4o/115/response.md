### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition describes an endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` which fetches a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object with a `results` array. Each item in this array has an `events` object with an `available` integer, and a `dates` array containing objects with `type` and `date` properties.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.events.available < size(return.dates[])-1`. This suggests that the number of available events is always less than the number of dates minus one.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant compares two unrelated quantities: the number of available events and the number of dates. Semantically, there is no clear reason why the number of events should be related to the number of dates minus one.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held true in 500 calls without a counterexample, and there were 650 examples with 481 distinct ones. This suggests a strong empirical backing.

3. **Specification Review**: The swagger definition does not provide any constraints or relationships between `events.available` and `dates`. The invariant seems to be an accidental correlation rather than a rule derived from the API's logic or specification.

4. **Example Values**: All example values show `events.available` as 0, which trivially satisfies the invariant when there are at least two dates. However, this does not guarantee the invariant holds for all possible values of `events.available`.

### Conclusion
The invariant appears to be a "false-positive" due to the lack of semantic relationship between the two fields and the absence of specification support. The empirical evidence is strong but likely coincidental.

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.7

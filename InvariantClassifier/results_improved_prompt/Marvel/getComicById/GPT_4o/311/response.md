### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has `stories` and `events` objects. The `stories` object has a `returned` property, which indicates the number of stories returned in the collection, with a maximum of 20. The `events` object has an `available` property, which indicates the total number of available events in the list and is always greater than or equal to the `returned` value.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.stories.returned >= return.events.available`. This suggests that the number of stories returned is always greater than or equal to the number of available events.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification:**
   - The `events.available` field is described as the total number of available events, which should logically be greater than or equal to the number of events returned (though this is not explicitly stated in the provided excerpt).
   - The `stories.returned` field is the number of stories returned, with a cap at 20.

2. **Invariant Logic:**
   - The invariant suggests that the number of stories returned is always greater than or equal to the number of available events. This seems counterintuitive based on the descriptions, as the number of available events should logically be independent of the number of stories returned.

3. **Empirical Evidence:**
   - The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. There were 37 distinct examples, and all supported the invariant.
   - Example values show `stories.returned` consistently being greater than or equal to `events.available`, but this could be due to the specific data set or API behavior rather than a logical rule.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic meanings of the fields, the invariant `return.stories.returned >= return.events.available` does not logically align with the expected behavior of the API as described. The `available` field should not be constrained by the `returned` field of a different object type (stories vs. events). The lack of counterexamples might be due to the specific data set or API implementation rather than a true logical invariant.

Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

**Confidence:** 0.9

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` which fetches a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `characters` object with two integer properties:
- `available`: The total number of characters available in the list.
- `returned`: The number of characters actually returned in the response, with a maximum of 20.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.characters.available >= return.characters.returned`. This invariant suggests that the total number of available characters (`available`) is always greater than or equal to the number of characters returned (`returned`).

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Specification Alignment**: The Swagger definition explicitly states that `available` will always be greater than or equal to `returned`. This is because `returned` is capped at 20, while `available` represents the total number of characters, which can be any non-negative integer.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there were 11,600 examples supporting the invariant, with 46 distinct examples. This high number of examples and the absence of counterexamples strongly support the invariant.

3. **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant makes semantic sense. It is logical that the total number of available characters (`available`) would be greater than or equal to the number of characters actually returned (`returned`), especially given the constraint that `returned` is capped at 20.

### Conclusion
Given the explicit statement in the Swagger definition, the logical consistency of the invariant, and the empirical evidence supporting it, the invariant `return.characters.available >= return.characters.returned` is a **true-positive**. The invariant is consistent with the API's design and behavior as described in the documentation.

### Confidence
The confidence in this classification is very high due to the alignment with the specification, logical consistency, and strong empirical support.

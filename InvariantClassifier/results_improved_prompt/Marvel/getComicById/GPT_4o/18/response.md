### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` that fetches a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each element in the `results` array can have a `textObjects` array, which consists of objects with properties `type`, `language`, and `text`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.textObjects[] elements != null`, which implies that none of the elements in the `textObjects` array should be null.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Definition**: The `textObjects` array is described as containing descriptive text blurbs for the comic. Each element in this array is an object with specific properties (`type`, `language`, `text`). The definition does not explicitly state that elements can be null.

2. **Test Results**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found, suggesting that the invariant holds true across a large number of cases.

3. **Semantic Analysis**: Given that `textObjects` is meant to contain descriptive text objects, it makes sense that each element should be a valid object and not null. Null elements would not provide any descriptive value and could indicate an error in data handling.

4. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not mention any scenario where `textObjects` elements can be null. Thus, the invariant does not contradict the specification.

### Conclusion

Based on the Swagger definition, the semantic purpose of the `textObjects` array, and the extensive testing without counterexamples, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant `return.textObjects[] elements != null` is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of the API as described and observed.

### Confidence

Given the large number of tests and the logical consistency with the API's purpose, the confidence in this classification is very high.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have `textObjects` and `urls` arrays. The `textObjects` array consists of descriptive text blurbs, while the `urls` array contains public web site URLs related to the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`size(return.textObjects[])-1 <= size(return.urls[])-1`

This invariant suggests that the number of `textObjects` minus one is less than or equal to the number of `urls` minus one.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - **`textObjects`**: These are descriptive text blurbs, which could include solicit text, preview text, etc.
   - **`urls`**: These are URLs related to the comic, which could include links to purchase, preview, or other related resources.

2. **Logical Analysis**:
   - The invariant essentially states that the number of `textObjects` is less than or equal to the number of `urls`. This could imply that for every text blurb, there is at least one URL, or there are more URLs than text blurbs.
   - Given the nature of comics, it is plausible that there are multiple URLs (e.g., purchase links, previews) for each text blurb (e.g., solicit text).

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant held true for 100 calls with no counterexamples found.
   - There were 96 examples supporting the invariant, with 63 distinct examples.

### Conclusion

The invariant seems plausible given the context of the API and the nature of the data. The empirical evidence strongly supports the invariant, as no counterexamples were found in 100 calls, and a significant number of examples were consistent with the invariant. Therefore, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a "true-positive" with high confidence.

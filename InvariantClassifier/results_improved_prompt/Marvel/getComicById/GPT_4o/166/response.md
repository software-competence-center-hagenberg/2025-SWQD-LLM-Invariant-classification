### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` which is a GET request to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response for a successful request (status code 200) includes a JSON object with a property `copyright` of type string. The description for this property is "The copyright notice for the returned result."

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.copyright == "© 2022 MARVEL"`. This suggests that the `copyright` field in the response always equals "© 2022 MARVEL".

### Analysis

1. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

2. **Distinct Examples**: Out of 11,650 examples, only one distinct value was observed, which is "© 2022 MARVEL". This further supports the invariant.

3. **Specification**: The Swagger specification does not provide any constraints or variations for the `copyright` field. It simply states that it is a string containing the copyright notice. There is no mention of other possible values or conditions under which the value might change.

4. **Semantic Consideration**: The copyright notice is typically a static string that does not change frequently, especially if it is tied to a specific year or entity like "MARVEL". This makes it plausible that the invariant holds true.

### Conclusion

Given the strong empirical evidence (10,000 calls with no counterexamples), the lack of specification indicating variability, and the semantic nature of copyright notices, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant is consistent with the expected behavior of a static copyright notice for a specific year.

### Confidence

The confidence in this classification is high due to the extensive testing and the nature of the data involved.

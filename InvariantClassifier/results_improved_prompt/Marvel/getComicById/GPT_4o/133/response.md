### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have `urls` and `prices` arrays. The `urls` array consists of objects with `type` and `url` properties, while the `prices` array consists of objects with `type` and `price` properties.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

- **Invariant:** `size(return.urls[]) % size(return.prices[]) == 0`

This invariant suggests that the number of URLs is a multiple of the number of prices for each comic returned.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis:**
   - The `urls` array represents different public web site URLs related to the comic, which could include links to purchase, view, or share the comic.
   - The `prices` array represents different price points for the comic, such as print price, digital price, etc.

2. **Empirical Evidence:**
   - The invariant was tested with 1000 calls, and no counterexamples were found.
   - There are 1650 examples supporting the invariant, with 979 distinct examples.

3. **Logical Analysis:**
   - The invariant implies a specific relationship between the number of URLs and the number of prices. However, the swagger definition does not explicitly mention any relationship between these two arrays.
   - The invariant could hold due to specific data structuring or business logic not evident from the swagger definition alone.
   - The invariant might hold in practice due to the way data is organized or due to constraints not documented in the swagger.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of explicit documentation supporting this invariant and the absence of any logical reason why the number of URLs should be a multiple of the number of prices, this invariant seems coincidental based on the data observed. The invariant is likely a result of specific data patterns rather than a true logical constraint of the API.

Therefore, despite the empirical evidence, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** due to the lack of semantic or documented basis for such a relationship.

**Confidence:** 0.7, as the empirical evidence is strong, but the logical and semantic basis is weak.

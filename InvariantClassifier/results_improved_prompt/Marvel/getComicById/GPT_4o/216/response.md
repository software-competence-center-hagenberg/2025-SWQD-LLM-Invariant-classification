### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes two properties:
- `attributionText`: A string that serves as an attribution notice.
- `attributionHTML`: An HTML representation of the attribution notice.

The documentation specifies that either `attributionText` or `attributionHTML` should be displayed on screens containing data from the Marvel Comics API.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.attributionText` is a substring of `return.attributionHTML`.

### Analysis
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.
- **Distinct Examples**: Out of 11,650 examples, only 1 was distinct, indicating that the response format is highly consistent.
- **Example Provided**: In the example, `return.attributionText` is indeed a substring of `return.attributionHTML`, which is consistent with the invariant.
- **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant makes semantic sense. `attributionHTML` is likely to be a formatted version of `attributionText`, which supports the idea that `attributionText` would be a substring of `attributionHTML`.

### Conclusion
Given the empirical evidence and the semantic consistency of the invariant, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of the API as described in the documentation and supported by the example provided.

### Confidence
The confidence in this classification is very high due to the large number of calls and the lack of counterexamples, combined with the logical consistency of the invariant.

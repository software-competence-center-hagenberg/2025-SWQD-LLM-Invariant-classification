### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array has a `digitalId` (an integer) and a `urls` array (a set of public website URLs for the resource).

- `digitalId`: An integer representing the ID of the digital comic. It is 0 if the comic is not available digitally.
- `urls`: An array of objects, each containing a `type` and a `url`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.digitalId != size(return.urls[])`, which asserts that the `digitalId` is not equal to the number of URLs in the `urls` array.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `digitalId` is an identifier for the digital version of a comic, and it is 0 if the comic is not available digitally.
   - The `urls` array contains URLs related to the comic, which could vary in number depending on the comic's availability and the number of related resources.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found.
   - There are 11,650 examples, with 7,633 distinct examples, supporting the invariant.
   - Example values show `digitalId` as 0 and `urls` containing one URL, which supports the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The specification does not explicitly state any relationship between `digitalId` and the number of URLs, but the invariant seems plausible given the data and the semantic roles of the fields.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic roles of `digitalId` and `urls`, and the empirical evidence from a large number of calls without counterexamples, the invariant `return.digitalId != size(return.urls[])` appears to be a true-positive. The lack of a direct relationship between these fields in the specification does not contradict the invariant, and the data supports it consistently.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.digitalId != size(return.urls[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two long scalars. Prints as x != y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 7633 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.data.results.digitalId=0; return.data.results.urls=[{"type":"detail","url":"http:\/\/marvel.com\/comics\/issue\/16790\/marvel_mystery_comics_1939_79?utm_campaign=apiRef&utm_source=anonymous"}]
return.data.results.digitalId=0; return.data.results.urls=[{"type":"detail","url":"http:\/\/marvel.com\/comics\/issue\/12693\/alpha_flight_1983_32?utm_campaign=apiRef&utm_source=anonymous"}]

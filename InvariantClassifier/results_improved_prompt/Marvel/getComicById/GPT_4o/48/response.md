### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The given Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` which is used to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response for a successful request (HTTP 200) is an object containing a `data` field, which itself is an object containing a `results` array. Each item in this `results` array is expected to have an `events` object.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.events != null`, which implies that for each item in the `results` array, the `events` object is never null.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Definition:** The Swagger definition specifies that each item in the `results` array has an `events` object. However, it does not explicitly state whether this `events` object can be null or not.

2. **Empirical Evidence:** The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical backing for the invariant.

3. **Semantic Consideration:** The `events` object is likely to contain information related to the comic, such as events where the comic was featured or related events. It is reasonable to assume that this information might always be present, especially if the API is designed to always provide comprehensive data about each comic.

4. **Specification Ambiguity:** The Swagger definition does not explicitly mention the possibility of `events` being null, which leaves room for interpretation. However, given the empirical evidence, it seems that the API is designed to always include non-null `events`.

### Conclusion

Given the strong empirical evidence from 10,000 calls and the reasonable assumption that `events` is a crucial part of the comic data that is always provided, it is likely that the invariant `return.events != null` is a "true-positive". The lack of explicit contradiction in the Swagger definition further supports this conclusion.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object with a `results` array. Each item in `results` has a `dates` array (containing key dates for the comic) and a `prices` array (containing different prices for the comic).

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `size(return.dates[]) % size(return.prices[]) == 0`. This suggests that the number of date entries is a multiple of the number of price entries for each comic.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `dates` array contains key dates such as "onsale date" and "FOC date", while the `prices` array contains different types of prices such as "print price" and "digital price". There is no inherent semantic relationship that suggests the number of dates should be a multiple of the number of prices.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held true across 1000 API calls with 1650 examples, 929 of which were distinct. This suggests a strong empirical backing for the invariant.

3. **Specification Review**: The specification does not explicitly mention any relationship between the number of dates and prices. However, the lack of a counterexample in a significant number of tests suggests a pattern that might not be immediately obvious from the specification alone.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of semantic reasoning for the invariant and the absence of specification support, the invariant seems unlikely to be a true-positive. However, the strong empirical evidence suggests it might hold under current data conditions. Without a clear semantic or specification basis, it is more likely a coincidence rather than a rule enforced by the API design.

**Verdict**: false-positive

**Confidence**: 0.7 (The confidence is moderate due to the strong empirical evidence, but the lack of semantic or specification support reduces certainty.)

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each element in this `results` array can have an `images` array, which consists of objects with `path` and `extension` properties.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.images[] elements != null`, which implies that none of the elements in the `images` array are null.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Definition**: The `images` array is described as containing objects with specific properties (`path` and `extension`). There is no explicit mention in the Swagger definition that allows for null elements within the `images` array.

2. **Test Results**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

3. **Semantic Context**: Given that `images` is an array of objects with defined properties, it makes sense that each element should be a valid object rather than null. Null elements would not provide any meaningful data about promotional images.

### Conclusion

Based on the Swagger definition, the semantic context of the `images` array, and the extensive testing with no counterexamples, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant `return.images[] elements != null` is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the expected structure and purpose of the `images` array, and the lack of null elements in 10,000 calls further supports this conclusion.

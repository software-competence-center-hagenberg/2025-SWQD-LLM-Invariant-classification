### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema specifies that the response will include a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `stories` object, which includes a `returned` integer property. This property indicates the number of stories returned in the collection, with a maximum of 20 stories.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.stories.returned >= 2`. This invariant suggests that the number of stories returned is always at least 2.

### Analysis
- **Number of Calls and Examples**: We have 500 calls with no counterexamples, and 15 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.
- **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not explicitly state a minimum number of stories, only a maximum of 20. However, the lack of counterexamples in 500 calls suggests a strong pattern.
- **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant makes sense in a comic context, where it is plausible that a comic would have multiple stories, though not guaranteed by the specification.

### Conclusion
Given the absence of counterexamples in a significant number of calls and the plausible nature of the invariant in the context of comics, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a "true-positive". However, since the specification does not explicitly guarantee a minimum of 2 stories, there remains some uncertainty.

**Confidence**: 0.8

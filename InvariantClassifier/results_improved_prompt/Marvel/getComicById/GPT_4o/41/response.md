### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` that fetches a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `characters` object with an `available` property. The `available` property is described as "The number of total available characters in this list. Will always be greater than or equal to the 'returned' value."

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.characters.available >= 1`. This invariant suggests that the `available` field in the `characters` object of the response will always be at least 1.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The specification states that the `available` field represents the total number of available characters and will always be greater than or equal to the "returned" value. However, it does not explicitly state that `available` must be greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: We have 10,000 calls with no counterexamples and 11,650 examples supporting the invariant, with 46 distinct examples. This is a strong empirical indication that the invariant holds.

3. **Semantic Consideration**: The `available` field represents a count of characters. In most practical scenarios, it is reasonable to expect that a comic would have at least one character, especially if the API is designed to return comics with characters.

### Conclusion

Given the strong empirical evidence and the reasonable assumption that comics typically have characters, the invariant `return.characters.available >= 1` is likely a "true-positive". However, the specification does not explicitly guarantee this, which introduces a slight uncertainty. Nonetheless, the practical evidence and logical reasoning strongly support the invariant.

### Verdict
- **Verdict**: true-positive
- **Confidence**: 0.9 (high confidence due to empirical evidence and logical reasoning, but not absolute due to lack of explicit specification guarantee)

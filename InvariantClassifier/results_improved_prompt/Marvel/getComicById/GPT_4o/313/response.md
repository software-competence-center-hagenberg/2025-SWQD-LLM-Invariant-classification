### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` that fetches a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array has an `events` object with an `available` integer property and a `dates` array, where each item is an object with a `type` and a `date`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.events.available <= size(return.dates[])`

This invariant suggests that the number of available events (`return.events.available`) is less than or equal to the number of dates in the `dates` array (`size(return.dates[])`).

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `events.available` field represents the number of events available for a comic, while `dates` represents key dates related to the comic. There is no direct semantic relationship between the number of events and the number of dates, as they represent different concepts.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 5,822 distinct examples supporting the invariant.

3. **Specification Review**: The Swagger definition does not provide any explicit relationship between the number of events and the number of dates. The invariant seems to be an empirical observation rather than a logically derived rule from the API specification.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic connection between the number of events and the number of dates, and the absence of any specification that supports this invariant, it is likely a coincidence that the invariant holds across the tested examples. The invariant does not logically follow from the API's intended design or documentation.

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Confidence

The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear lack of semantic relationship and the absence of specification support for the invariant.

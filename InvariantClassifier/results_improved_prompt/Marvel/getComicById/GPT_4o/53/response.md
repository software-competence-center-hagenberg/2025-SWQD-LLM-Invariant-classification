### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this `results` array has a `dates` field, which is itself an array of objects. Each object in the `dates` array has a `type` and a `date`.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that the size of the `dates` array is always one of {2, 3, 4}.

### Analysis
1. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.
2. **Distinct Examples**: Out of 11,650 examples, 5,759 were distinct, indicating a wide variety of data was tested.
3. **Example Values**: The provided examples consistently show a `dates` array of size 3. This aligns with the invariant.
4. **Specification**: The swagger definition does not specify a fixed number of dates, but it does imply that multiple dates are possible by describing it as "A list of key dates for this comic."
5. **Semantic Reasoning**: The types of dates (e.g., onsale date, FOC date) suggest that a comic could have multiple relevant dates, but the specific number is not fixed by the specification.

### Conclusion
Given the extensive empirical evidence and the lack of specification contradicting the invariant, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant is a true-positive. The invariant is consistent with the observed behavior of the API and does not conflict with the swagger definition.

### Confidence
The confidence in this classification is high due to the large number of calls and examples tested without finding a counterexample.

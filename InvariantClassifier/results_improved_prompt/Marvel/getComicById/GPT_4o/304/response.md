### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has an `events` object with an `available` property, which is an integer representing the number of total available events. The documentation specifies that this value will always be greater than or equal to the "returned" value, but does not specify an upper limit or specific values that `available` can take.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.events.available one of { 0, 1, 2 }`.

### Analysis

- **Empirical Evidence:** The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. The values observed were exclusively 0, 1, and 2.
- **Specification Review:** The swagger definition does not explicitly restrict the `available` field to the values 0, 1, or 2. It only states that `available` must be greater than or equal to the "returned" value.
- **Semantic Consideration:** The `available` field represents the number of events available for a comic. While it is possible for a comic to have 0, 1, or 2 events, it is also plausible for a comic to have more than 2 events, especially if the API is designed to handle a wide range of comics with varying numbers of events.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of explicit restriction in the API specification and the semantic possibility of having more than 2 events, the invariant is likely a "false-positive". The empirical evidence suggests a pattern, but without a specification constraint, it is not guaranteed to hold for all possible comics.

**Verdict:** false-positive

**Confidence:** 0.8 (high confidence due to semantic reasoning and lack of specification constraint)

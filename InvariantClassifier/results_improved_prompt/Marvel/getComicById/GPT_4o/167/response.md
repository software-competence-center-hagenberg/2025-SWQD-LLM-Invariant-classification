### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response includes a field `attributionText`, which is a string meant to display an attribution notice for the data provided by the Marvel Comics API.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

- **Invariant:** `return.attributionText == "Data provided by Marvel. \251 2022 MARVEL"`

This invariant suggests that the `attributionText` field always contains the string "Data provided by Marvel. © 2022 MARVEL".

### Analysis

1. **Number of Calls and Examples:**
   - The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found.
   - There were 11,650 examples in the request data, with only 1 distinct example for the `attributionText` field.

2. **Semantic Analysis:**
   - The `attributionText` is described as a notice that should be displayed with the data. It is plausible that this text is standardized across all responses to ensure consistent attribution.
   - The invariant matches the example provided, which is "Data provided by Marvel. © 2022 MARVEL".

3. **Specification Consideration:**
   - The specification does not mention any variability in the `attributionText`. It is reasonable to assume that Marvel would want a consistent attribution notice across all their API responses.

### Conclusion

Given the high number of calls and the lack of counterexamples, along with the semantic expectation of a consistent attribution notice, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of a standardized attribution text, and the specification does not suggest any alternative values.

**Verdict:** True-positive

**Confidence:** 0.95

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have an `events` object with an `available` integer property, representing the total number of available events. Additionally, each item can have a `collectedIssues` array, which lists issues collected in the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.events.available >= size(return.collectedIssues[])`

This invariant suggests that the number of available events (`events.available`) is always greater than or equal to the number of collected issues (`collectedIssues[]`).

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `events.available` property indicates the total number of events available, which is conceptually different from the `collectedIssues` array, which lists issues collected in the comic.
   - There is no direct semantic relationship between the number of events and the number of collected issues. They represent different aspects of a comic resource.

2. **Swagger Specification**:
   - The specification does not provide any indication that the number of available events should be related to the number of collected issues.
   - The description for `collectedIssues` suggests it is generally empty for periodical formats, implying that its size could be zero or vary independently of `events.available`.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant held true for 100 calls, which suggests a pattern but does not confirm a logical relationship between the two fields.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of a logical or semantic relationship between `events.available` and `collectedIssues[]`, and the fact that the specification does not imply such a relationship, this invariant is likely a coincidence rather than a true invariant. The invariant does not logically follow from the API's design or documentation, making it a likely false-positive.

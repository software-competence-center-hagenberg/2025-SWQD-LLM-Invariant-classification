### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have a `textObjects` array, which holds descriptive text blurbs for the comic. Each text object has properties like `type`, `language`, and `text`.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `size(return.textObjects[]) one of { 0, 1, 2 }`. This means that the `textObjects` array can only have 0, 1, or 2 items.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Definition**: The definition does not specify any constraints on the number of text objects that can be included in the `textObjects` array. It simply describes the structure of each text object.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 500 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests that, in practice, the `textObjects` array typically contains 0, 1, or 2 items.

3. **Examples**: The provided examples all show a single text object in the `textObjects` array, which aligns with the invariant.

4. **Potential for Variability**: While the invariant holds for the tested cases, the lack of explicit constraints in the Swagger definition means that the API could potentially return more than 2 text objects in future responses, especially if the data model changes or if different comics have more descriptive text blurbs.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of explicit constraints in the Swagger definition and the possibility that different comics might have varying numbers of text objects, the invariant is likely a "false-positive". The empirical evidence is strong but not definitive, as it is based on a limited set of calls and examples. Therefore, while the invariant holds for the tested cases, it cannot be guaranteed to hold universally across all possible API responses.

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.7

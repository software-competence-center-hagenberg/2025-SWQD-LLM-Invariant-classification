### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have an `images` array, and each image has an `extension` property, which is a string representing the file extension of the image.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.extension)==3`, which implies that the file extension for images is always three characters long.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Specification**: The swagger definition specifies that `extension` is a string, but it does not specify any constraints on its length. However, common image file extensions such as 'jpg', 'png', 'gif', etc., are typically three characters long.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested over 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 19,977 examples were observed, with only two distinct values: 'png' and 'jpg'. Both of these are three characters long.

3. **Common File Extensions**: Most common image file extensions are indeed three characters long. While there are exceptions (e.g., 'jpeg', 'tiff'), these are less common in web APIs, which often use the shorter forms.

4. **Likelihood of Other Extensions**: Given the nature of the API and the observed data, it seems unlikely that other extensions are used, or they are used so infrequently that they were not captured in the 10,000 calls.

### Conclusion
The invariant `LENGTH(return.extension)==3` is likely a "true-positive" given the empirical evidence and the common usage of three-character file extensions in web APIs. However, there is a slight possibility of encountering a longer extension, but this seems improbable based on the data.

**Verdict**: true-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

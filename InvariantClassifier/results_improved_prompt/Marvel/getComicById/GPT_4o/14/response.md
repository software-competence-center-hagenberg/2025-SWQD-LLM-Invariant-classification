### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `digitalId` property. According to the swagger definition, `digitalId` is an integer that represents the ID of the digital comic representation. If the comic is not available digitally, this ID will be 0.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.digitalId >= 0`. This invariant suggests that the `digitalId` field in the response will always be greater than or equal to 0.

### Analysis
- **Swagger Specification:** The swagger explicitly states that `digitalId` will be 0 if the comic is not available digitally. This implies that the minimum value for `digitalId` is indeed 0.
- **Empirical Evidence:** The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 11,650 examples were observed, with 6,069 distinct values, all adhering to the invariant.
- **Semantic Consistency:** The invariant is semantically consistent with the swagger definition, as the minimum value of `digitalId` is 0, aligning with the invariant `digitalId >= 0`.

### Conclusion
Given the swagger definition, which explicitly states that `digitalId` will be 0 if not available digitally, and the extensive empirical evidence supporting the invariant, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is a "true-positive." The invariant is consistent with the API's documented behavior and the observed data.

### Confidence
The confidence in this classification is very high due to the clear alignment between the swagger specification and the observed data, as well as the large number of examples supporting the invariant.

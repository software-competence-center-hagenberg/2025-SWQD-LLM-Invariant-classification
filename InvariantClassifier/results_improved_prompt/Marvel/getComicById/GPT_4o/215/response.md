### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes several fields, among which are `copyright` and `attributionText`. The `copyright` field is described as a string containing the copyright notice for the returned result, while `attributionText` is a string that serves as an attribution notice for the result, which should be displayed on screens containing data from the Marvel Comics API.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is that `return.copyright` is a substring of `return.attributionText`. This means that every time a response is returned, the `copyright` string should be found within the `attributionText` string.

### Analysis

1. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.
2. **Distinct Examples**: There was only 1 distinct example found among 11,650 examples, indicating that the format of the response is highly consistent.
3. **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant makes semantic sense because the `attributionText` is meant to include information about the data source, which logically includes the copyright notice. The example provided (`return.copyright=© 2022 MARVEL; return.attributionText=Data provided by Marvel. © 2022 MARVEL`) supports this, as the copyright notice is indeed part of the attribution text.
4. **Specification Alignment**: The specification does not explicitly mention that the `copyright` must be a substring of `attributionText`, but it does imply that `attributionText` should contain comprehensive information about the source, which would naturally include the copyright.

### Conclusion

Given the strong empirical evidence, the semantic consistency of the invariant, and the alignment with the specification's intent, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive." The invariant logically follows from the purpose of the `attributionText` field, and the lack of counterexamples further supports this conclusion.

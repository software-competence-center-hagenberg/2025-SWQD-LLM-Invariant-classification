### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have `images` and `events` properties:

- **images**: An array of promotional images associated with the comic.
- **events**: An object containing an `items` array, which lists events related to the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`size(return.images[])-1 >= size(return.events.items[])-1`

This implies that the number of images (minus one) is always greater than or equal to the number of events (minus one) for each comic returned.

### Analysis

1. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 1000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 123 examples were observed, with 76 distinct examples supporting the invariant.

2. **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant compares the number of images to the number of events for a comic. While the schema allows for both images and events to be present, it does not specify any relationship between their counts. However, the lack of counterexamples in a significant number of tests suggests a pattern in the data.

3. **Specification Check**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state any constraints or relationships between the number of images and events. Thus, the invariant is not contradicted by the specification.

4. **Contextual Plausibility**: It is plausible that comics generally have more promotional images than associated events, which could explain the observed invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the empirical evidence and the lack of specification contradiction, the invariant appears to be a true-positive. The pattern observed in the data is consistent and plausible given the context of the API.

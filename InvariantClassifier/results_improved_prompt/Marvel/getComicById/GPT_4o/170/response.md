### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `limit` property described as "The requested result limit." However, the description does not specify any default or fixed value for `limit`.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.data.limit == 20`, which suggests that the `limit` field in the response always equals 20.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Definition:** The swagger documentation does not specify any fixed value for `limit`. It only describes it as "The requested result limit," which implies it could vary based on the request or server configuration.

2. **Empirical Evidence:** The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 11,650 examples were observed, with only one distinct value (20) for `limit`.

3. **Semantic Context:** The `limit` field typically indicates the maximum number of items to return in a list or collection. However, since this endpoint fetches a single comic by ID, the concept of a "limit" is somewhat ambiguous. It might be a default value set by the server, but the documentation does not clarify this.

4. **Potential for Variation:** Without explicit documentation stating that `limit` is always 20, there is a possibility that this value could change based on different server configurations, API versions, or request parameters not covered in the current documentation.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of explicit documentation stating that `limit` is always 20 and the semantic ambiguity of having a `limit` in a single resource fetch, this invariant is likely a "false-positive." The empirical evidence is strong, but the absence of a clear specification makes it unreliable to assume this invariant will hold under all circumstances.

**Verdict:** false-positive
**Confidence:** 0.7

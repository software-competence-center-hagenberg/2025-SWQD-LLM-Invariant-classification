### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The given Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` that fetches a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `characters` object with a `returned` property. This property is an integer representing the number of characters returned in this collection, with a maximum of 20 characters.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.characters.returned >= 1`. This invariant suggests that the number of characters returned (`returned`) is always at least 1.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not explicitly state a minimum number of characters that must be returned. However, it does specify a maximum of 20.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 11,600 examples were observed, with 20 distinct values, all satisfying the invariant.

3. **Example Values**: The example values provided (8, 9, 19, 10, 20) all satisfy the invariant `>= 1`.

4. **Semantic Consideration**: The endpoint is designed to fetch a single comic, and it is reasonable to expect that a comic would have at least one character associated with it. However, the specification does not explicitly guarantee this.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of counterexamples after extensive testing and the reasonable expectation that a comic would have at least one character, the invariant `return.characters.returned >= 1` appears to be a true-positive. However, due to the absence of explicit confirmation in the specification, there is a slight uncertainty.

**Verdict**: True-positive

**Confidence**: 0.9

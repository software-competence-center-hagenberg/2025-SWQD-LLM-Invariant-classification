### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array represents a comic and has properties such as `digitalId` and `stories`. The `digitalId` is an integer that represents the ID of the digital comic, and it is 0 if the comic is not available digitally. The `stories` property is an object containing an `items` array, which lists the stories associated with the comic. Each story has properties like `resourceURI`, `name`, and `type`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.digitalId != size(return.stories.items[])-1`. This invariant suggests that the `digitalId` of a comic is not equal to the size of the `stories.items` array minus one.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `digitalId` is an identifier for the digital version of the comic, while `stories.items` is an array of stories related to the comic. There is no inherent semantic relationship between the digital ID of a comic and the number of stories it contains. The invariant suggests a comparison between these two unrelated fields.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 1000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 1650 examples were observed, with 979 distinct examples supporting the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not provide any indication that the `digitalId` should be related to the number of stories. The `digitalId` is specifically mentioned to be 0 if the comic is not available digitally, which is a distinct condition unrelated to the number of stories.

### Conclusion

Despite the empirical evidence supporting the invariant, the lack of a semantic relationship between `digitalId` and the size of `stories.items` suggests that the invariant is likely coincidental rather than a true reflection of the API's logic. The invariant seems to arise from the specific dataset used during testing rather than a fundamental rule of the API.

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a "false-positive" due to the lack of a logical connection between the fields being compared.

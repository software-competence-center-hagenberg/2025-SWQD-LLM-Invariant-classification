### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have `collections` and `images` arrays. The `collections` array lists collections that include the comic, and the `images` array lists promotional images associated with the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `size(return.collections[])-1 != size(return.images[])`. This invariant suggests that the size of the `collections` array minus one is not equal to the size of the `images` array.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `collections` array and the `images` array serve different purposes. `collections` lists collections that include the comic, while `images` lists promotional images. There is no inherent reason why the size of these two arrays should be related in a specific way, such as one being always different from the other minus one.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, only 22 examples were observed, with 16 distinct examples. This is a relatively small sample size, which may not be representative of all possible responses.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The swagger definition does not provide any constraints or relationships between the sizes of `collections` and `images`. Therefore, any invariant relating these two fields is not supported by the specification.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic irrelevance between the `collections` and `images` arrays, the lack of specification support, and the relatively small sample size, this invariant is likely a "false-positive". The fact that no counterexamples were found in 100 calls could be due to the limited variety of data rather than a true invariant.

**Verdict**: false-positive

**Confidence**: 0.7

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `stories` object with an `available` integer property, indicating the number of stories available. Additionally, there is a `textObjects` array, which contains descriptive text blurbs for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is:

`return.stories.available >= size(return.textObjects[])-1`

This invariant suggests that the number of available stories is always greater than or equal to the size of the `textObjects` array minus one.

### Analysis
1. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 7,367 examples supporting this invariant, with 5,036 being distinct.

2. **Semantic Analysis**: The `stories.available` field represents the number of stories, while `textObjects` represents descriptive text blurbs. There is no direct semantic relationship between the number of stories and the number of text blurbs, which makes this invariant seem coincidental rather than logically necessary.

3. **Specification Review**: The swagger definition does not provide any explicit relationship between `stories.available` and `textObjects`. The invariant seems to be an empirical observation rather than a rule derived from the API's specification.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of semantic relationship between the two fields and the absence of specification support, the invariant appears to be a "false-positive". It is likely a coincidental pattern observed in the data rather than a true invariant of the API.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.stories.available >= size(return.textObjects[])-1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of >= between two long scalars. Prints as x >= y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 7367 examples in the requests data, with 5036 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.data.results.stories.available=2; return.data.results.textObjects=[{"language":"en-us","text":"Brute Force and Heavy Metal battle head-to-head once and for all!","type":"issue_solicit_text"}]
return.data.results.stories.available=2; return.data.results.textObjects=[{"language":"en-us","text":"An Iron Man 2 tie-in issue!","type":"issue_solicit_text"}]
return.data.results.stories.available=2; return.data.results.textObjects=[{"language":"en-us","text":"Who killed Scarlet Witch? ULTIMATUM comes next!","type":"issue_preview_text"}]
return.data.results.stories.available=2; return.data.results.textObjects=[{"language":"en-us","text":"Guess how this story is going to end. I dare you.","type":"issue_solicit_text"}]
return.data.results.stories.available=2; return.data.results.textObjects=[{"language":"en-us","text":"CLASSIFIED!","type":"issue_solicit_text"}]

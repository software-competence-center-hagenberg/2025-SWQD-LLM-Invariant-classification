### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}`
- **Operation**: GET
- **Summary**: Fetches a single comic by id.
- **Response Schema**:
  - **data**: An object containing:
    - **results**: An array of comics, each with:
      - **dates**: An array of date objects, each with a `type` and `date`.
      - **images**: An array of image objects, each with a `path` and `extension`.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `size(return.dates[]) != size(return.images[])-1`
- **Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `!=` between two long scalars. Prints as `x != y`.

### Analysis

1. **Understanding the Invariant**:
   - The invariant suggests that the number of dates is not equal to the number of images minus one.
   - This implies that for any comic, the count of dates should not be exactly one less than the count of images.

2. **Swagger Specification**:
   - The specification does not provide any constraints or relationships between the `dates` and `images` arrays.
   - The `dates` array is described as a list of key dates for the comic, while the `images` array is a list of promotional images.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 50 calls were made to the API, and no counterexamples were found.
   - 46 distinct examples were observed where the invariant held true.

4. **Logical Consideration**:
   - There is no semantic or logical reason provided in the specification that would inherently link the number of dates to the number of images in such a way that this invariant would naturally hold.
   - The invariant seems arbitrary without additional context or constraints linking `dates` and `images`.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of specification support for a relationship between `dates` and `images`, and the arbitrary nature of the invariant, it is likely a coincidence that the invariant held true in the observed cases. The invariant does not appear to be a fundamental property of the API's design or data model.

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

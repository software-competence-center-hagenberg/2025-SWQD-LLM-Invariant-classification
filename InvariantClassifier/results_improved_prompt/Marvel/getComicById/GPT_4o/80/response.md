### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `digitalId` (an integer representing the digital version of the comic, which is 0 if not available digitally) and an `images` array (a list of promotional images associated with the comic).

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.digitalId >= size(return.images[])-1`. This suggests that the `digitalId` of a comic is always greater than or equal to the number of images associated with the comic minus one.

### Analysis
1. **Digital ID**: The `digitalId` is an integer that represents the digital version of the comic. It is 0 if the comic is not available digitally.
2. **Images**: The `images` array contains promotional images for the comic. The size of this array can vary.
3. **Invariant Logic**: The invariant implies a relationship between the digital ID and the number of images. Specifically, it suggests that the digital ID is always at least as large as the number of images minus one.

#### Example Analysis
- For `digitalId=54299` and `images` containing 1 image, the invariant holds as `54299 >= 1 - 1`.
- For `digitalId=0` and `images` containing 1 image, the invariant holds as `0 >= 1 - 1`.

### Conclusion
The invariant seems to hold for all provided examples and the logic does not contradict the swagger definition. However, the relationship between `digitalId` and the number of images is not explicitly defined in the API documentation, making this invariant potentially coincidental rather than intentional. Given the lack of explicit documentation support and the semantic disconnect between `digitalId` and `images`, this invariant is likely a **false-positive**. The invariant might hold due to the specific dataset or implementation details but is not guaranteed by the API specification.

**Confidence**: 0.7 (Moderate confidence due to lack of explicit specification support)

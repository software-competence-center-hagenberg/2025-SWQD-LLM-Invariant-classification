### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this `results` array can have `collectedIssues` and `dates` arrays.

- **collectedIssues**: This is an array that lists issues collected in the comic. The description notes that this array will generally be empty for periodical formats such as "comic" or "magazine".
- **dates**: This is an array that lists key dates for the comic, with each date having a type and a date value.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`size(return.collectedIssues[]) < size(return.dates[])-1`

This invariant suggests that the number of collected issues is always less than the number of dates minus one.

### Analysis

1. **Understanding the Context**:
   - The `collectedIssues` array is expected to be often empty, especially for periodicals.
   - The `dates` array is expected to have multiple entries since comics typically have several key dates (e.g., release date, final order cutoff date, etc.).

2. **Logical Consistency**:
   - Given that `collectedIssues` is often empty, the invariant `size(return.collectedIssues[]) < size(return.dates[])-1` would hold if `dates` has at least two entries.
   - The invariant implies that for `collectedIssues` to be non-empty, `dates` must have at least two more entries than `collectedIssues`.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests that the invariant holds under the tested conditions.

4. **Specification Alignment**:
   - The specification does not explicitly contradict the invariant. The nature of comics having multiple key dates and potentially empty `collectedIssues` supports the invariant.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the invariant seems logically consistent with the API's expected behavior and the provided specification. The absence of counterexamples in 100 calls further supports its validity. Therefore, the invariant is likely a "true-positive".

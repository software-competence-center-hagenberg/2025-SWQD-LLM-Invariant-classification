### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array has a `characters` object with an `available` integer indicating the number of characters available, and a `collectedIssues` array, which lists issues collected in the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.characters.available != size(return.collectedIssues[])`, which asserts that the number of available characters is not equal to the number of collected issues.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `characters.available` field represents the number of characters associated with the comic, while `collectedIssues` represents other issues collected within this comic. These two fields represent different concepts: one is about characters, and the other is about collected issues. There is no inherent reason why the number of characters should equal the number of collected issues.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not suggest any relationship between the number of characters and the number of collected issues. The description of `collectedIssues` indicates that it is often empty for periodicals, which further supports the idea that these two fields are independent.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: With 1000 calls made and no counterexamples found, along with 39 examples supporting the invariant, this suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic independence of the two fields and the lack of any specification indicating a relationship between them, combined with the empirical evidence from the API calls, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is a "true-positive." The invariant reflects a logical expectation based on the API's design and observed behavior.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` that fetches a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `stories` object with two relevant properties:

- `available`: An integer representing the total number of stories available.
- `items`: An array of story objects, each with properties like `resourceURI`, `name`, and `type`.

The description explicitly states that `available` will always be greater than or equal to the number of stories in `items`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.stories.available == size(return.stories.items[])`

This invariant suggests that the number of available stories (`available`) is exactly equal to the number of stories returned in the `items` array.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Description**: The Swagger documentation states that `available` will always be greater than or equal to the number of stories in `items`. This implies that `available` can be greater than the size of `items`, which directly contradicts the invariant that they are always equal.

2. **Empirical Data**: Despite 100 calls to the API without finding a counterexample, and 150 examples supporting the invariant, the documentation explicitly allows for cases where `available` is greater than the size of `items`. This suggests that the invariant might hold in practice due to specific data conditions but is not guaranteed by the API's design.

3. **Semantic Consideration**: The invariant does not make semantic sense given the API's description. The `available` field is meant to indicate the total number of stories available, not just those returned in the `items` array.

### Conclusion

Given the explicit contradiction between the invariant and the API's documentation, the invariant is a **false-positive**. The empirical data, while supportive, does not override the clear specification that `available` can exceed the size of `items`. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `pageCount` (an integer representing the number of story pages) and `dates` (an array of objects, each with a `type` and `date`).

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.pageCount != size(return.dates[])-1`. This suggests that the number of pages in the comic (`pageCount`) is not equal to the number of dates minus one.

### Analysis
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `pageCount` represents the number of pages in a comic, while `dates` represents key dates related to the comic (e.g., publication dates). There is no inherent semantic relationship between the number of pages in a comic and the number of key dates minus one.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 500 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 650 examples were found, with 483 being distinct, all supporting the invariant.
- **Logical Consideration**: The lack of a semantic relationship between `pageCount` and `dates` suggests that the invariant is coincidental rather than logically necessary. The invariant seems to be an artifact of the data rather than a rule that should hold universally.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of a semantic relationship between `pageCount` and `dates`, and considering that the invariant seems coincidental based on the data, it is likely a "false-positive." The invariant does not logically follow from the API's design or purpose, despite the empirical evidence supporting it.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have `collectedIssues` and `images` arrays. 

- `collectedIssues`: An array that lists issues collected in the comic. It is noted that this will generally be empty for periodical formats such as "comic" or "magazine".
- `images`: An array of promotional images associated with the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`size(return.collectedIssues[])-1 <= size(return.images[])-1`

This invariant suggests that the number of collected issues minus one is less than or equal to the number of images minus one.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `collectedIssues` array is expected to be empty for certain formats, which implies that its size could often be zero.
   - The `images` array is for promotional images, which could vary in number independently of the `collectedIssues`.

2. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The invariant effectively simplifies to `size(collectedIssues) <= size(images)`. This means that the number of collected issues is less than or equal to the number of images.
   - There is no explicit relationship in the specification that suggests a dependency between the number of collected issues and the number of images.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant held true for 100 calls, which suggests a pattern but does not guarantee it is universally true.

### Conclusion

The invariant seems to hold based on the empirical evidence provided, but there is no logical or semantic basis in the API specification that inherently links the number of collected issues to the number of images. The invariant could be coincidentally true for the sampled data but may not hold for all possible comics, especially given the variability in comic formats and associated promotional materials.

Therefore, the invariant is likely a **false-positive** because the relationship between `collectedIssues` and `images` is not supported by the API specification, and the invariant may not hold for all possible valid inputs.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `digitalId` (an integer representing the digital comic ID, which is 0 if not available digitally) and a `characters` object. The `characters` object contains an `available` field, which indicates the number of characters available in the comic and is always greater than or equal to the "returned" value.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.digitalId != return.characters.available`. This invariant suggests that the `digitalId` of a comic is not equal to the number of characters available in that comic.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - `digitalId` is an identifier for the digital version of a comic, which is typically a unique number.
   - `characters.available` is a count of characters in the comic, which is a non-negative integer.
   - Semantically, these two fields represent different concepts: one is an ID, and the other is a count. It is unlikely that these two fields would naturally be equal.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant holds for 10,000 calls without a single counterexample.
   - There are 11,650 examples supporting this invariant, with 6,112 distinct examples.
   - Example values show a clear distinction between `digitalId` and `characters.available`, with `digitalId` being significantly larger and not matching the character count.

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The specification does not suggest any relationship between `digitalId` and `characters.available` that would imply equality.
   - The invariant does not contradict any explicit specification details.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic differences between `digitalId` and `characters.available`, the lack of any specification suggesting they could be equal, and the empirical evidence from a large number of calls, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant is consistent with the expected behavior of the API and the nature of the data fields involved.

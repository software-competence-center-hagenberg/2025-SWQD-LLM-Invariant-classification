### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this `results` array includes a `prices` array, which lists various prices for the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.prices != null`, which implies that for every comic fetched, the `prices` array should not be null.

### Analysis

1. **Response Schema**: The schema specifies that `prices` is an array. In JSON, an array can be empty but not null unless explicitly set to null. The schema does not explicitly state that `prices` can be null, which suggests that it is expected to be an array, potentially empty but not null.

2. **Number of Calls**: The invariant was tested over 10,000 calls without encountering a null `prices` array. This high number of calls without a counterexample strongly suggests that the invariant holds true under normal operation conditions.

3. **Semantic Context**: The `prices` array is meant to list prices for the comic, which implies that it is a fundamental part of the comic's data structure. Even if no prices are available, the array would likely be empty rather than null to maintain consistency in the data structure.

### Conclusion

Given the schema's implication that `prices` is an array and the extensive testing without encountering a null value, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant `return.prices != null` is a true-positive. The semantic expectation and the lack of counterexamples support this conclusion.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `data.results` field is an array, which contains a list of comics. Each comic has a `prices` field, which is also an array. Each item in the `prices` array is an object with `type` and `price` properties. The `type` describes the kind of price (e.g., print or digital), and `price` is the actual price in USD.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `size(return.prices[]) one of { 1, 2 }`. This means that the `prices` array for any comic can only have 1 or 2 elements.

### Analysis

1. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 11,650 examples were collected, with 106 distinct examples, all conforming to the invariant.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly limit the number of prices a comic can have. However, the examples provided suggest that each comic typically has either one or two prices, likely corresponding to different formats (e.g., print and digital).

3. **Semantic Reasoning**: It is reasonable to assume that a comic might have multiple price points, but typically these are limited to a few standard formats (e.g., print and digital). The invariant aligns with this assumption, as it allows for one or two price entries.

### Conclusion

Given the extensive empirical evidence supporting the invariant and the reasonable assumption that comics have a limited number of price formats, the invariant `size(return.prices[]) one of { 1, 2 }` is likely a true-positive. The lack of counterexamples across a large number of calls further strengthens this conclusion.

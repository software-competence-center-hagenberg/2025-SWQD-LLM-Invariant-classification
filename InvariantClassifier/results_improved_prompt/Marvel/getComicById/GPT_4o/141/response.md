### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have `variants` and `collectedIssues` arrays. The `variants` array contains variant issues of the comic, while the `collectedIssues` array contains issues collected in this comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`size(return.variants[]) - 1 >= size(return.collectedIssues[]) - 1`

This invariant suggests that the number of variants minus one is greater than or equal to the number of collected issues minus one.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `variants` array represents different versions of the comic, including the original if the current issue is a variant. The `collectedIssues` array represents issues collected within this comic, which is often empty for periodical formats.

2. **Logical Analysis**: The invariant simplifies to `size(return.variants[]) >= size(return.collectedIssues[])`. This means the number of variant issues is always greater than or equal to the number of collected issues.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held true across 100 calls without a counterexample.

4. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not explicitly state any constraints that would contradict this invariant. It is plausible that a comic might have more variants than collected issues, especially if collected issues are often empty.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic meaning of the fields, the logical simplification of the invariant, and the empirical evidence from 100 calls, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is a "true-positive". The specification does not contradict this invariant, and the nature of comics suggests that variants could indeed be more numerous than collected issues.

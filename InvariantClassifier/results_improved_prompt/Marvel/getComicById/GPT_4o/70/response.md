### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `digitalId`, representing the ID of the digital comic, and a `stories` object, which includes an `available` field indicating the number of available stories.

- **digitalId**: An integer representing the digital ID of the comic. It is specified to be 0 if the comic is not available digitally.
- **stories.available**: An integer representing the number of available stories for the comic. It is always greater than or equal to the "returned" value, but no specific relationship to `digitalId` is mentioned.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.digitalId != return.stories.available`, which asserts that the digital ID of the comic is not equal to the number of available stories.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Relationship**: There is no semantic relationship between `digitalId` and `stories.available`. The `digitalId` is an identifier for the digital version of the comic, while `stories.available` is a count of stories. These two fields serve different purposes and are unlikely to be related in a way that would make them equal.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not mention any relationship between `digitalId` and `stories.available`. The `digitalId` is primarily used to identify the digital version, while `stories.available` is a count of stories, which is unrelated to the ID.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held true across 10,000 calls with no counterexamples found. Additionally, there are 11,650 examples supporting this invariant, with 6,115 distinct examples, suggesting a strong empirical basis.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic relationship between `digitalId` and `stories.available`, the absence of any specification indicating a potential equality, and the strong empirical evidence from a large number of calls, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant is likely to hold due to the unrelated nature of the two fields.

**Confidence**: 0.95

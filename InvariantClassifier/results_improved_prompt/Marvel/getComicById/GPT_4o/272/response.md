### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each element in this array has a `stories` object with a `returned` integer, indicating the number of stories returned (up to 20). Additionally, there is a `textObjects` array, which contains descriptive text blurbs for the comic, with each text object having properties like `type`, `language`, and `text`.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.stories.returned >= size(return.textObjects[])`, which suggests that the number of stories returned is always greater than or equal to the number of text objects.

### Analysis
- **Number of Calls and Examples:** The invariant was tested over 500 calls without finding a counterexample, and 335 examples were found, with 333 being distinct.
- **Example Values:** The examples provided show that the `returned` value for stories is consistently greater than or equal to the size of the `textObjects` array.
- **Semantic Analysis:** The `stories.returned` field represents the number of stories, while `textObjects` represents descriptive text blurbs. There is no direct semantic relationship that would inherently enforce this invariant, as the number of stories and the number of text blurbs are conceptually independent.
- **Specification:** The specification does not mention any relationship between the number of stories and the number of text objects, which suggests that any observed relationship might be coincidental or due to the specific dataset used for testing.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of a semantic relationship between the number of stories and the number of text objects, and the absence of specification details supporting this invariant, it is likely that this invariant is a "false-positive". The invariant might hold for the tested dataset but does not have a logical basis to be universally true for all possible datasets.

### Confidence
The confidence in this classification is relatively high due to the semantic analysis and the specification review, which do not support the invariant as a necessary condition.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this `results` array can have a `variants` array and a `dates` array.

- **`variants`**: This array lists variant issues for the comic, including the original issue if the current issue is a variant.
- **`dates`**: This array lists key dates for the comic, such as the onsale date or FOC date.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

- **Invariant**: `size(return.variants[]) != size(return.dates[])`

This invariant suggests that the number of variant issues (`variants`) is not equal to the number of key dates (`dates`) for any given comic.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - **Variants**: Represents different versions or issues of a comic.
   - **Dates**: Represents important dates related to the comic's lifecycle.
   
   These two arrays represent fundamentally different types of information. It is plausible that the number of variant issues does not correlate directly with the number of key dates, as they serve different purposes.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 50 calls were made to the API, and no counterexamples were found.
   - 9 distinct examples were observed where this invariant held true.

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The specification does not indicate any direct relationship between the number of variants and the number of dates. Therefore, the invariant does not contradict the specification.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic differences between `variants` and `dates`, the lack of any specification suggesting a direct correlation between their sizes, and the empirical evidence from 50 API calls without a counterexample, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a "true-positive." The invariant seems to hold due to the independent nature of the `variants` and `dates` arrays.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `digitalId` (an integer representing the ID of the digital comic, which is 0 if not available digitally) and a `stories` object, which includes a `returned` field (an integer indicating the number of stories returned, up to 20).

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.digitalId != return.stories.returned`. This invariant suggests that the `digitalId` of a comic is never equal to the number of stories returned for that comic.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `digitalId` is an identifier for the digital version of the comic, while `stories.returned` is a count of stories. Semantically, these two fields represent different concepts: one is an ID, and the other is a count. There is no inherent reason for these two values to be equal, as they serve different purposes.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there were 11,500 examples with 6,088 distinct examples supporting the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not suggest any relationship between `digitalId` and `stories.returned` that would imply they could be equal. The `digitalId` being 0 indicates the comic is not available digitally, which is unrelated to the number of stories.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic difference between the two fields, the lack of any specification suggesting they could be equal, and the extensive empirical evidence supporting the invariant, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive." The invariant is consistent with the expected behavior of the API as described in the specification and observed in the data.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}"
  get:
    summary: Fetches a single comic by id.
    description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':

                          type: integer
                          description: The number of total available stories in this list. Will always be greater than or equal to the "returned" value.
                  items:

                      type: object

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.stories.available > return.events.available

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 1000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 1500 examples in the requests data, with 26 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.data.results.stories.available=6; return.data.results.events.available=0
return.data.results.stories.available=8; return.data.results.events.available=0
return.data.results.stories.available=4; return.data.results.events.available=1
return.data.results.stories.available=4; return.data.results.events.available=0
return.data.results.stories.available=2; return.data.results.events.available=1

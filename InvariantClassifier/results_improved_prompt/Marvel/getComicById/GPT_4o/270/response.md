### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has `stories` and `events` objects, each with an `available` property. The `available` property for both `stories` and `events` is described as the number of total available items in the list, and it is stated that this number will always be greater than or equal to the "returned" value.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.stories.available > return.events.available`, which suggests that the number of available stories is always greater than the number of available events for a given comic.

### Analysis

1. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 1000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 1500 examples supporting the invariant, with 26 distinct examples.

2. **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant compares two different properties of a comic resource: the number of available stories and the number of available events. While the swagger definition provides constraints on each property individually (i.e., they are both greater than or equal to the "returned" value), it does not specify any relationship between the two properties.

3. **Examples**: The provided examples consistently show `stories.available` being greater than `events.available`. However, the lack of a specification explicitly stating this relationship means that the invariant is not guaranteed by the API's design.

4. **Specification Ambiguity**: The swagger definition does not mention any relationship between the number of stories and events. Therefore, while the invariant holds empirically, it is not supported by the API's specification.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of specification support and the semantic independence of the `stories` and `events` properties, the invariant `return.stories.available > return.events.available` is likely a "false-positive". The empirical evidence suggests it holds in practice, but without specification support, it cannot be guaranteed for all possible valid requests.

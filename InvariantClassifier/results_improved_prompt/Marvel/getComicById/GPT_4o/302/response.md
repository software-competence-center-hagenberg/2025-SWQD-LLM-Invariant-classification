### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has an `images` array, and each image has an `extension` property that is a string. The `extension` represents the file extension for the image.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: "`return.extension one of { "jpg", "png" }`". This suggests that the `extension` field for images in the response can only be "jpg" or "png".

### Analysis
- **Number of Calls and Examples:** The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This is a strong indication that the invariant holds true.
- **Distinct Values:** Out of 17,355 examples, only two distinct values were observed: "jpg" and "png".
- **Swagger Definition:** The Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the `extension` field, but it is reasonable to assume that common image formats like "jpg" and "png" are used for promotional images.
- **Semantic Context:** The use of "jpg" and "png" as image formats is common in web APIs, especially for promotional images, which supports the likelihood of this invariant being correct.

### Conclusion
Given the high number of calls and examples without any counterexamples, along with the common usage of "jpg" and "png" for image formats, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The lack of specification for other image formats in the Swagger definition further supports this conclusion.

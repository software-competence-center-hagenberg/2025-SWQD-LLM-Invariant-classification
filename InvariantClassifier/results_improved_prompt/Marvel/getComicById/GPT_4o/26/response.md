### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have a `collectedIssues` array, which is described as a list of issues collected in the comic. The description notes that this array will generally be empty for periodical formats such as "comic" or "magazine".

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.collectedIssues != null`. This invariant suggests that the `collectedIssues` array is never null.

### Analysis

- **Response Schema:** The schema specifies `collectedIssues` as an array. In JSON, an array can be empty but not null unless explicitly set as such.
- **Description Insight:** The description indicates that `collectedIssues` will generally be empty for certain formats, implying that it is expected to exist (i.e., not be null) but may contain no items.
- **Empirical Evidence:** With 10,000 calls made and no counterexamples found, it strongly suggests that `collectedIssues` is consistently present in the response, albeit sometimes empty.

### Conclusion

Given the schema definition and the description, it is reasonable to conclude that `collectedIssues` is always initialized as an array (possibly empty) rather than being null. The absence of counterexamples in a large number of calls further supports this conclusion. Therefore, the invariant `return.collectedIssues != null` is likely a "true-positive".

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have a `variantDescription`, which is a string describing the variant of the comic, such as an alternate cover or a special edition.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.variantDescription one of { "GARNER VARIANT", "WHITE VARIANT" }`.

### Analysis
- **Data from Calls**: We have tried 50 calls and found 50 examples, with 3 distinct examples. The examples provided are:
  - `return.data.results.variantDescription=WHITE VARIANT`
  - `return.data.results.variantDescription=GARNER VARIANT`
  - `return.data.results.variantDescription=` (empty string)
- **Swagger Specification**: The specification describes `variantDescription` as a text description of the variant if the issue is a variant. It does not restrict the values to "GARNER VARIANT" or "WHITE VARIANT".
- **Potential Variants**: Given the nature of comics, there could be numerous variant descriptions beyond the two observed. Variants could include different artists, printings, or special editions, which are not captured in the invariant.

### Conclusion
The invariant is likely a **false-positive** because the `variantDescription` field is expected to have a wide range of possible values beyond just "GARNER VARIANT" and "WHITE VARIANT". The examples found are likely just a small subset of all possible variant descriptions. The specification does not limit the descriptions to these two values, and the presence of an empty string as a valid value further suggests variability.

### Confidence
Given the analysis, the confidence in this classification is high, as the invariant does not align with the expected variability of comic variant descriptions.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `digitalId` (an integer) and a `dates` array, which contains objects with `type` and `date` properties.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.digitalId != size(return.dates[])`. This means that the digital ID of the comic should not be equal to the number of date objects in the `dates` array.

### Analysis

1. **Digital ID**: According to the swagger definition, `digitalId` is an integer that represents the ID of the digital comic. It is explicitly mentioned that this will be `0` if the comic is not available digitally.

2. **Dates Array**: The `dates` array contains key dates for the comic, such as the onsale date and FOC date. The number of items in this array can vary depending on the number of relevant dates for the comic.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 11,650 examples supporting the invariant, with 7,128 distinct examples.

4. **Semantic Analysis**: There is no direct semantic relationship between the `digitalId` and the number of dates. The `digitalId` is an identifier, while the `dates` array represents temporal information about the comic. The invariant suggests a non-equality relationship, which is not inherently meaningful in this context.

5. **Example Values**: All provided example values show `digitalId` as `0`, which is consistent with the invariant since the `dates` array has a size of `2` in these examples. However, this does not guarantee that the invariant will hold for all possible values of `digitalId` and `dates`.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic connection between `digitalId` and the size of the `dates` array, and the fact that the invariant is based on empirical evidence without a clear logical basis, it is likely that this invariant is a "false-positive." The invariant holds in the tested cases, but there is no reason to believe it will hold universally across all possible inputs and states of the API.

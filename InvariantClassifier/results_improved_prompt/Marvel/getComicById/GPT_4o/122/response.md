### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have `textObjects` and `prices` arrays. The `textObjects` array contains descriptive text blurbs for the comic, while the `prices` array contains different price points for the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.prices[])`

This invariant suggests that for any comic, the number of text objects is less than or equal to the number of price entries.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Definition Context**:
   - The `textObjects` array is meant to hold descriptive text blurbs, which could vary in number depending on the comic's marketing or descriptive needs.
   - The `prices` array is meant to hold different price points, which could include various formats (e.g., print, digital) or special offers.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 100 calls were made to the API, and no counterexamples were found.
   - 96 examples were observed, with 63 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.

3. **Logical Consideration**:
   - There is no inherent logical reason why the number of text objects should always be less than or equal to the number of price entries. The number of text blurbs could easily exceed the number of price points if a comic has multiple descriptive texts but only a few pricing options.
   - The invariant might hold in the observed data due to specific data characteristics or constraints not captured in the Swagger definition.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of logical necessity for this invariant and the absence of explicit constraints in the Swagger definition that would enforce this relationship, the invariant is likely a "false-positive." The observed data might not cover all possible scenarios, especially considering the limited number of calls (100) and the specific nature of the examples.

**Verdict**: False-positive

**Confidence**: 0.7 (Moderate confidence due to the lack of logical necessity and limited empirical evidence)

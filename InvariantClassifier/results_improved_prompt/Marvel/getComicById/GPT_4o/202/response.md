### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `resourceURI` (a string representing the canonical URL for the comic) and a `characters` object, which includes a `collectionURI` (a string representing the path to the full list of characters in the comic).

### Invariant

The invariant in question is that `return.resourceURI` is a substring of `return.characters.collectionURI`.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `resourceURI` represents the URL for the comic itself, while the `collectionURI` for characters is a URL that extends the `resourceURI` by appending `/characters`. This semantic relationship suggests that the `resourceURI` should indeed be a substring of the `collectionURI`.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 11,650 examples were observed, with 7,623 being distinct, all supporting the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The Swagger definition does not specify any alternative structures for these URIs that would contradict the invariant. The examples provided align perfectly with the expected structure of the URLs.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic relationship between the `resourceURI` and the `collectionURI`, the lack of counterexamples in a large number of tests, and the alignment with the Swagger definition, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant makes logical sense given the structure of the URLs and the purpose of the fields.

**Confidence**: 0.95

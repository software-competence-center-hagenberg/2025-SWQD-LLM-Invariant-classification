### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response is expected to contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array has a `digitalId` and a `prices` array. The `digitalId` is an integer representing the digital version of the comic, and it is 0 if the comic is not available digitally. The `prices` array contains objects with `type` and `price` fields, describing different price points for the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.digitalId != size(return.prices[])`, which states that the `digitalId` should not be equal to the number of price entries in the `prices` array.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `digitalId` is an identifier for the digital version of the comic, while `prices` is an array of price objects. There is no inherent semantic relationship between an identifier and the number of price entries, suggesting that any equality or inequality between these two is coincidental rather than intentional.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not mention any relationship between the `digitalId` and the number of price entries. The `digitalId` is primarily used to identify the digital version, and the `prices` array is used to list various prices, which can vary independently of the `digitalId`.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held true across 10,000 calls with 6,116 distinct examples, indicating a strong empirical backing. However, the lack of a semantic or specification-based relationship suggests that this invariant might be coincidental.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of a semantic or specification-based relationship between `digitalId` and the number of price entries, the invariant is likely a "false-positive". The empirical evidence is strong, but without a logical basis for the relationship, it is likely coincidental. Therefore, the invariant should be classified as a "false-positive" with moderate confidence.

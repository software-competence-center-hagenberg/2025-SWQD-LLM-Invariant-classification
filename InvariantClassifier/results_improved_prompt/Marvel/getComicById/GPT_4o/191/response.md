### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has an `ean` property, which is a string representing the EAN barcode for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.ean)==20`, which suggests that the `ean` string for each comic is always 20 characters long.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Definition:** The swagger definition specifies that `ean` is a string but does not specify a fixed length. However, EAN barcodes are typically 13 digits long. The presence of a 20-character length invariant suggests additional formatting or data is included in the `ean` string.

2. **Empirical Evidence:** The invariant was tested over 1000 API calls without finding a counterexample, and 1650 examples were found, with 73 distinct examples all adhering to the 20-character length.

3. **Example Values:** The provided example values for `ean` are all 20 characters long, which supports the invariant. However, the typical length for an EAN is 13 digits, suggesting that additional characters (such as spaces or other formatting) are included.

4. **Specification vs. Observation:** The specification does not explicitly contradict the invariant, as it does not specify the length of the `ean`. The observed data consistently supports the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of contradiction in the specification, the consistent empirical evidence across a significant number of calls, and the plausible explanation that the `ean` includes additional formatting, the invariant is likely a "true-positive." The invariant holds under the current implementation and observed data, even though it might not align with typical EAN lengths.

**Verdict:** true-positive
**Confidence:** 0.85

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `pageCount` representing the number of story pages in the comic, and a `stories` object with a `returned` property indicating the number of stories returned in this collection, with a maximum of 20.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.pageCount != return.stories.returned`, which suggests that the number of pages in the comic (`pageCount`) is not equal to the number of stories returned (`stories.returned`).

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: 
   - `pageCount` refers to the total number of pages in the comic, which is a fixed attribute of the comic.
   - `stories.returned` refers to the number of stories returned in the response, which is capped at 20.
   - Semantically, `pageCount` and `stories.returned` represent different concepts: one is about the total number of pages, and the other is about the number of stories returned.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found.
   - 11,500 examples were found, with 263 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.
   - Example values consistently show `pageCount` being greater than `stories.returned`, which is logical given the cap on `stories.returned`.

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The specification does not suggest any relationship where `pageCount` should equal `stories.returned`. In fact, given the cap on `stories.returned`, it is unlikely for these two values to be equal unless the comic has exactly the same number of pages as the stories returned, which is rare.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic difference between `pageCount` and `stories.returned`, the empirical evidence supporting the invariant, and the specification details, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant logically holds as `pageCount` and `stories.returned` are inherently different metrics and are unlikely to be equal.

**Confidence**: 0.95

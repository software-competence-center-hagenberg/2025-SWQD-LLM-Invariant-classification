### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a field `attributionHTML`, which is described as an HTML representation of the attribution notice for the result. The documentation specifies that this notice or the contents of the `attributionText` field should be displayed on all screens containing data from the Marvel Comics API.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is:

```
return.attributionHTML == "<a href=\"http://marvel.com\">Data provided by Marvel. \251 2022 MARVEL</a>"
```

This invariant suggests that the `attributionHTML` field always contains the exact string specified.

### Analysis
- **Number of Calls and Examples:** The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 11,650 examples were observed, with only one distinct value, which matches the invariant.
- **Specification:** The specification does not explicitly state that `attributionHTML` must always be this exact string, but it does imply that an attribution notice is required. The invariant matches the example provided in the test data.
- **Semantic Consideration:** The `attributionHTML` field is meant to provide attribution, and it is plausible that Marvel uses a standard attribution format across all their API responses.

### Conclusion
Given the high number of calls and examples without any variation, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is a "true-positive." The invariant aligns with the expected use of a standard attribution notice, which is consistent with the API's purpose and the example provided. However, without explicit confirmation from the specification, there remains a slight possibility of variation in different contexts or future updates.

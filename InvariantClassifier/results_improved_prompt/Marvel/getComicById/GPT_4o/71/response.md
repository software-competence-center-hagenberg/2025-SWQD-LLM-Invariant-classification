### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `digitalId` (an integer representing the ID of the digital comic, which is 0 if not available digitally) and an `events` object, which includes an `available` integer indicating the number of available events.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.digitalId >= return.events.available`. This suggests that the `digitalId` of a comic is always greater than or equal to the number of available events associated with that comic.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `digitalId` is an identifier for the digital version of a comic, while `events.available` represents the count of events related to the comic. These two fields are semantically unrelated, as one is an identifier and the other is a count.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not provide any direct relationship between `digitalId` and `events.available`. The `digitalId` is primarily used to identify the digital representation of a comic, while `events.available` is a count of events, which can vary independently of the `digitalId`.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held true across 500 calls, with 401 distinct examples. However, all provided examples show `events.available` as 0, which trivially satisfies the invariant since any non-negative `digitalId` will be greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Potential Counterexamples**: The invariant could be violated if a comic has a `digitalId` of 0 (indicating no digital version) and a non-zero number of available events. The specification allows for `digitalId` to be 0, which could lead to a situation where `digitalId < events.available`.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic irrelevance between `digitalId` and `events.available`, and the potential for counterexamples as allowed by the specification, this invariant is likely a "false-positive". The empirical evidence is not strong enough to override the semantic and specification-based analysis, especially since all examples trivially satisfy the invariant due to `events.available` being 0.

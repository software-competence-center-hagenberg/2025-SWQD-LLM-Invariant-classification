### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `textObjects` array, and each `textObject` has a `type` field. The `type` field is described as "The canonical type of the text object (e.g. solicit text, preview text, etc.)."

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: "`return.type` one of { "70th_winner_desc", "issue_preview_text", "issue_solicit_text" }".

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The swagger definition provides a non-exhaustive example of what the `type` field might contain (e.g., solicit text, preview text). It does not explicitly limit the `type` to only these values, suggesting that other types could exist.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 500 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 508 examples were observed, with only 3 distinct values, all of which match the invariant.

3. **Semantic Context**: The `type` field is meant to describe the kind of text object. The examples provided in the invariant ("70th_winner_desc", "issue_preview_text", "issue_solicit_text") seem plausible within the context of comic descriptions.

4. **Potential for Other Values**: While the current data supports the invariant, the swagger's use of "e.g." implies that the list of possible values is not exhaustive. This suggests that other `type` values could exist, which were not encountered in the 500 calls.

### Conclusion

Given the swagger's implication that the `type` field could have more values than those observed, and the fact that only 500 calls were made, it is likely that the invariant is a "false-positive". The invariant holds for the observed data but may not hold universally for all possible responses from the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `digitalId` (an integer) and `textObjects` (an array of objects, each with properties like `type`, `language`, and `text`). The `digitalId` is described as the ID of the digital comic representation, which is `0` if the comic is not available digitally.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.digitalId >= size(return.textObjects[])-1`. This suggests that the `digitalId` should be greater than or equal to the number of `textObjects` minus one.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `digitalId` is an identifier for the digital representation of the comic, while `textObjects` are descriptive text blurbs. There is no apparent semantic relationship between the number of text objects and the digital ID. The digital ID is more likely to be related to the availability or versioning of the comic, whereas text objects are just metadata.

2. **Specification Review**: The specification does not mention any relationship between `digitalId` and `textObjects`. The `digitalId` being `0` indicates non-availability in digital format, which is unrelated to the number of text objects.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held true in 100 calls, with 96 examples supporting it and 63 distinct examples. However, the lack of a semantic relationship and specification support weakens the case for this invariant being a true-positive.

### Conclusion

Despite the empirical evidence, the invariant lacks a logical basis in the API's semantics and specification. The `digitalId` and the size of `textObjects` are unrelated in terms of their intended use and meaning. Therefore, the invariant is likely a coincidence rather than a true rule of the API.

**Verdict**: The invariant is a "false-positive".

**Confidence**: 0.7, due to the lack of semantic and specification support despite empirical evidence.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object with a `results` array. Each item in `results` can have `textObjects` and `prices` arrays. `textObjects` contains descriptive text blurbs, while `prices` contains price information for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is:

`size(return.textObjects[])-1 <= size(return.prices[])`

This implies that the number of text objects minus one is less than or equal to the number of prices.

### Analysis
- **Number of Calls**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true.
- **Distinct Examples**: Out of 7,702 examples, 5,048 were distinct, indicating a diverse set of data was tested.
- **Example Values**: The provided examples show a consistent pattern where the number of `textObjects` is equal to or less than the number of `prices`, supporting the invariant.
- **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant compares the number of descriptive text blurbs to the number of price entries. While these are different types of information, the invariant does not inherently contradict the API's description or expected behavior. It is plausible that each comic has a limited number of text blurbs compared to price entries, which might include different formats or editions.

### Conclusion
Given the extensive testing and the lack of counterexamples, along with the reasonable semantic relationship between the number of text blurbs and price entries, the invariant is likely a "true-positive." The invariant does not contradict any explicit information in the API specification and aligns with the observed data patterns.

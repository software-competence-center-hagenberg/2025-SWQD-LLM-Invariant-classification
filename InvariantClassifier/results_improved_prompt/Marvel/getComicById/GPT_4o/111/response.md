### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have an `events` object with an `available` integer indicating the number of events, and a `textObjects` array containing descriptive text blurbs about the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.events.available <= size(return.textObjects[])`

This invariant suggests that the number of available events for a comic is always less than or equal to the number of text objects associated with that comic.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `available` field in `events` represents the number of events related to the comic, while `textObjects` are descriptive texts about the comic. There is no direct semantic relationship between the number of events and the number of text objects, as they represent different aspects of the comic.

2. **Swagger Definition**: The swagger definition does not imply any relationship between the number of events and the number of text objects. The `available` field is described as the total number of events, and `textObjects` are described as descriptive texts, without any indication that one should be less than or equal to the other.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 50 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, the number of calls is relatively low, and the invariant was only observed in 33 distinct examples. The lack of counterexamples in such a small sample size does not strongly support the invariant, especially given the lack of semantic connection.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic connection between the number of events and the number of text objects, and the absence of any indication in the swagger definition that these two fields should be related in this way, the invariant is likely a coincidence rather than a true relationship. The small sample size further weakens the evidence for this invariant.

**Verdict**: false-positive

**Confidence**: 0.7 (Moderate confidence due to the semantic analysis and the small sample size)

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `characters` object with two integer properties:
- `available`: The total number of characters available in the list.
- `returned`: The number of characters actually returned in the response, with a maximum of 20.

The specification explicitly states that `available` will always be greater than or equal to `returned`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:
- `return.characters.available == return.characters.returned`

This invariant suggests that the number of characters available is always equal to the number of characters returned.

### Analysis

1. **Specification vs. Invariant**: According to the specification, `available` should be greater than or equal to `returned`. This means that while they can be equal, they do not have to be. The invariant suggests they are always equal, which contradicts the flexibility allowed by the specification.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 50 calls, all of which supported the invariant. However, only 13 distinct examples were found, which is a relatively small sample size.

3. **Logical Consistency**: The invariant does not logically align with the specification, which allows for cases where `available` is greater than `returned`, especially when the number of characters exceeds 20.

### Conclusion

Given the specification's allowance for `available` to be greater than `returned`, the invariant `return.characters.available == return.characters.returned` is likely a "false-positive". The empirical evidence, while supportive, is not extensive enough to override the clear specification that allows for inequality between these values.

**Verdict**: False-positive

**Confidence**: 0.9

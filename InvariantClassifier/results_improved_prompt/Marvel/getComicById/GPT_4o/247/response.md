### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema for a successful request (HTTP 200) includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have `collectedIssues` and `images` arrays.

- **collectedIssues**: This is an array that lists issues collected in the comic. The description notes that this array will generally be empty for periodical formats such as "comic" or "magazine".
- **images**: This is an array that lists promotional images associated with the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`size(return.collectedIssues[]) <= size(return.images[])`

This invariant suggests that for each comic, the number of collected issues is less than or equal to the number of images.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - **collectedIssues**: Typically, collected issues are specific to certain types of comics, such as trade paperbacks or collections, and may not be present in periodicals.
   - **images**: Promotional images are generally more common and can include cover art, variant covers, and other promotional materials.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found.

3. **Logical Reasoning**:
   - Given the nature of comics, especially periodicals, it is reasonable to expect that the `collectedIssues` array is often empty or smaller than the `images` array. This is because periodicals may not collect issues, while promotional images are more universally applicable.

### Conclusion

The invariant `size(return.collectedIssues[]) <= size(return.images[])` is consistent with the expected behavior of the API based on the swagger definition and the nature of comic resources. The fact that no counterexamples were found in 100 calls further supports this. Therefore, it is likely a true-positive invariant.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have `collectedIssues` and `dates` arrays.

- **collectedIssues**: An array that lists issues collected in the comic. It is noted that this array will generally be empty for periodical formats such as "comic" or "magazine".
- **dates**: An array that lists key dates for the comic, such as the onsale date or FOC date.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `size(return.collectedIssues[]) != size(return.dates[])`, which suggests that the number of collected issues is not equal to the number of dates for any given comic.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - `collectedIssues` and `dates` serve different purposes. `collectedIssues` is related to the content of the comic, while `dates` pertains to metadata about the comic's release and other key dates.
   - There is no inherent reason why the number of collected issues should match the number of dates. In fact, the description suggests that `collectedIssues` is often empty for certain formats, which would naturally lead to a mismatch in sizes.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 1000 calls without finding a counterexample.
   - 39 examples were found, with 23 being distinct, supporting the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**:
   - The swagger definition does not imply any relationship between the sizes of `collectedIssues` and `dates`. The invariant does not contradict the specification.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic differences between `collectedIssues` and `dates`, the lack of any specification suggesting a relationship between their sizes, and the empirical evidence from testing, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant is consistent with the expected behavior of the API as described in the swagger documentation.

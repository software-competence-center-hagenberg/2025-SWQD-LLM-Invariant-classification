### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `digitalId`, representing the ID of the digital comic, and a `characters` object, which includes a `returned` field indicating the number of characters associated with the comic.

- **digitalId**: An integer representing the digital version of the comic. If the comic is not available digitally, this value is 0.
- **characters.returned**: An integer representing the number of characters returned in the comic's character collection, with a maximum of 20.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.digitalId != return.characters.returned`, which asserts that the `digitalId` of a comic is not equal to the number of characters returned.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Relevance**: The `digitalId` and `characters.returned` fields represent fundamentally different concepts. The `digitalId` is an identifier for the digital version of the comic, while `characters.returned` is a count of characters associated with the comic. There is no inherent reason for these two values to be equal, as they represent different types of data.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 6,088 distinct examples supporting the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not suggest any relationship between `digitalId` and `characters.returned` that would imply they could be equal. The `digitalId` being 0 for non-digitally available comics further supports the lack of a meaningful relationship between these fields.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic irrelevance between `digitalId` and `characters.returned`, the lack of counterexamples in a large number of tests, and the absence of any specification details suggesting a relationship, the invariant `return.digitalId != return.characters.returned` is highly likely to be a **true-positive**. The invariant holds due to the unrelated nature of the fields and the extensive empirical evidence supporting it.

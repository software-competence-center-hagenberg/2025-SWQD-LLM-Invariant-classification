### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have `textObjects` and `images` arrays. The `textObjects` array contains descriptive text blurbs for the comic, while the `images` array contains promotional images associated with the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

- **Invariant:** `size(return.textObjects[])-1 <= size(return.images[])`

This invariant suggests that the number of text objects minus one is less than or equal to the number of images for each comic.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis:**
   - The `textObjects` and `images` arrays serve different purposes: one for text descriptions and the other for images. There is no inherent reason why the number of text objects should be related to the number of images.
   - The invariant implies that there is at least one more image than text object, which is not a typical requirement for comics.

2. **Empirical Evidence:**
   - The invariant held true across 1000 API calls without a counterexample.
   - There are 1104 examples supporting the invariant, with 661 distinct examples.

3. **Specification Check:**
   - The swagger definition does not specify any relationship between the number of text objects and images. Therefore, the invariant is not explicitly supported by the API specification.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic analysis and the lack of specification support, the invariant seems to be coincidental rather than a rule enforced by the API. The empirical evidence is strong, but without a logical or specified reason for this relationship, it is likely a "false-positive."

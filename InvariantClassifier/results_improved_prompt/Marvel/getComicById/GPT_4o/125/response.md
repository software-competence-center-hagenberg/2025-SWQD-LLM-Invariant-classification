### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object with a `results` array. Each item in this array can have `textObjects` and `collectedIssues` arrays. 

- **textObjects**: An array of text blurbs related to the comic, each having a `type`, `language`, and `text`.
- **collectedIssues**: An array of issues collected in this comic, usually empty for periodicals like comics or magazines.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`size(return.textObjects[])-1 >= size(return.collectedIssues[])-1`

This implies that the number of `textObjects` is always greater than or equal to the number of `collectedIssues`.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Context**: The `textObjects` are descriptive texts about the comic, while `collectedIssues` are other issues included in the comic. Given the description, `collectedIssues` is often empty for periodicals.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: 100 calls were made to this API, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests that the invariant holds in practice.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The specification indicates that `collectedIssues` is generally empty for certain formats, which aligns with the invariant that `textObjects` (which are more likely to be present) are greater than or equal to `collectedIssues`.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic context and the empirical evidence from 100 calls without counterexamples, the invariant seems to hold true. The specification supports the idea that `collectedIssues` is often empty, making it reasonable for `textObjects` to be greater or equal in number.

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.stories.returned >= size(return.textObjects[])-1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of >= between two long scalars. Prints as x >= y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 7367 examples in the requests data, with 5036 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.data.results.stories.returned=1; return.data.results.textObjects=[{"language":"en-us","text":"IN 5 MONTHS...TIME RUNS OUT!","type":"issue_solicit_text"}]
return.data.results.stories.returned=2; return.data.results.textObjects=[{"language":"en-us","text":"Cap, Namor and the Torch scramble to rescue Bucky and Toro!","type":"issue_solicit_text"}]
return.data.results.stories.returned=3; return.data.results.textObjects=[{"language":"en-us","text":"Reprint of Uncanny X-Men (1963) #21","type":"issue_solicit_text"}]
return.data.results.stories.returned=2; return.data.results.textObjects=[{"language":"en-us","text":"Dyna-Mite becomes the Mighty Destroyer II!","type":"issue_solicit_text"}]
return.data.results.stories.returned=2; return.data.results.textObjects=[{"language":"en-us","text":"Reprinting material from Tales to Astonish (1959) #35 and #49!","type":"issue_solicit_text"}]

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have `textObjects` and `prices` arrays. 
- `textObjects`: An array of objects, each representing a descriptive text blurb for the comic, with properties such as `type`, `language`, and `text`.
- `prices`: An array of objects, each representing a price for the comic, with properties such as `type` and `price`.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `size(return.textObjects[])-1 <= size(return.prices[])-1`.
This implies that the number of text objects minus one is less than or equal to the number of prices minus one, effectively meaning `size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.prices[])`.

### Analysis
- **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant compares the number of text objects to the number of prices for a comic. Semantically, these two arrays are independent; the number of descriptive texts does not necessarily correlate with the number of price entries. 
- **Swagger Definition**: The swagger definition does not specify any relationship between the number of text objects and the number of prices. Each serves a distinct purpose: one for descriptive text and the other for pricing information.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held true across 100 calls with 96 examples and 63 distinct examples. However, the lack of a counterexample does not inherently validate the invariant, especially given the semantic independence of the two fields.

### Conclusion
The invariant suggests a relationship between two independent fields (`textObjects` and `prices`) that is not supported by the API's specification or logical reasoning. The absence of counterexamples in 100 calls does not provide sufficient evidence to classify this invariant as a true-positive, especially given the semantic independence of the fields involved.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have `textObjects` and `dates` arrays. 

- **textObjects**: This is an array of objects, each containing descriptive text blurbs for the comic. Each text object has properties like `type`, `language`, and `text`.
- **dates**: This is an array of objects, each representing key dates for the comic. Each date object has properties like `type` and `date`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.dates[])`.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - **textObjects**: These are descriptive texts related to the comic, which could vary in number depending on how much descriptive information is available or deemed necessary for each comic.
   - **dates**: These are key dates associated with the comic, such as release dates, which are typically more standardized and predictable in number.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found.
   - There are 7,702 examples supporting the invariant, with 5,082 distinct examples.

3. **Logical Reasoning**:
   - The invariant suggests that the number of descriptive text objects is always less than or equal to the number of date objects. This could be logically consistent if each comic has a fixed or predictable number of key dates, while the text objects are optional or vary based on content availability.
   - The lack of counterexamples in a large number of calls suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic roles of `textObjects` and `dates`, and the empirical evidence from a significant number of API calls without counterexamples, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant `size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.dates[])` is a **true-positive**. The invariant aligns with the potential structure and content of the API response, where dates are more standardized and text objects are more variable.

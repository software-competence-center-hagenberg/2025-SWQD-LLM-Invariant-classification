### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The given Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` that fetches a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have a `collectedIssues` array, which is described as a list of issues collected in this comic. The description notes that this array will generally be empty for periodical formats such as "comic" or "magazine".

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.collectedIssues[] == []`, which suggests that the `collectedIssues` array is always empty.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Description:** The description explicitly states that the `collectedIssues` array will generally be empty for periodical formats such as "comic" or "magazine". This suggests that there are cases where the array might not be empty, particularly for non-periodical formats.

2. **Empirical Evidence:** The invariant was tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests that in practice, the `collectedIssues` array is often empty, at least for the sample of comics tested.

3. **Potential for Variability:** The description implies that the array could be non-empty for certain types of comics (non-periodicals). Therefore, while the invariant holds for the tested cases, it might not hold universally across all possible comics.

### Conclusion

Given the description in the Swagger documentation that the `collectedIssues` array will "generally" be empty, it implies that there are valid cases where it might not be empty. The invariant `return.collectedIssues[] == []` is likely a "false-positive" because it does not account for the potential variability in the data for non-periodical comic formats. The fact that 100 calls did not find a counterexample suggests it is common for the array to be empty, but not guaranteed.

**Verdict:** false-positive

**Confidence:** 0.8 (The confidence is high because the Swagger documentation explicitly allows for non-empty arrays in certain cases, despite the lack of counterexamples in the tested calls.)

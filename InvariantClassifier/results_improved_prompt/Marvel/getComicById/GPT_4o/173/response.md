### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its unique ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each element in this `results` array represents a comic resource, with various properties such as `id`, `digitalId`, `title`, and others.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.data.results[] elements != null`, which implies that none of the elements in the `results` array should be null.

### Analysis

1. **Response Structure**: According to the Swagger definition, the `results` array is expected to contain comic objects with specific properties. There is no indication in the Swagger definition that any element of this array could be null.

2. **Number of Calls**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This high number of calls without any null elements in the `results` array strongly suggests that the invariant holds true.

3. **Semantic Context**: The purpose of this endpoint is to fetch a single comic resource, which logically implies that the `results` array should contain at least one valid comic object and not null elements. If the comic ID is valid, the API should return a valid comic object, not a null placeholder.

### Conclusion

Given the structure of the API response, the semantic purpose of the endpoint, and the extensive testing without any counterexamples, it is highly likely that the invariant `return.data.results[] elements != null` is a true-positive. The API is designed to return valid comic objects, and the absence of null elements in the `results` array aligns with this design.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `digitalId` (an integer representing the digital version of the comic, which is 0 if not available digitally) and `variants` (an array of variant issues for the comic).

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.digitalId >= size(return.variants[])-1`. This means that the `digitalId` should be greater than or equal to the number of variants minus one.

### Analysis
1. **Digital ID**: The `digitalId` is an integer that is 0 if the comic is not available digitally. Otherwise, it represents the ID of the digital version.
2. **Variants**: This is an array of variant issues. The size of this array indicates the number of variant issues available.
3. **Invariant Meaning**: The invariant suggests that the digital ID should be at least as large as the number of variants minus one. This could imply that the digital ID is used as an index or a count related to the variants, but this is not explicitly stated in the API documentation.

### Example Analysis
- In the examples provided, the `digitalId` is often 0, which aligns with the invariant since the size of `variants` is 1, making `size(return.variants[])-1` equal to 0.
- For non-zero `digitalId` values, the invariant still holds, but the relationship between `digitalId` and `variants` is not explicitly clear from the documentation.

### Conclusion
The invariant holds for the examples provided, but the relationship between `digitalId` and `variants` is not explicitly defined in the API documentation. Given the limited number of calls (50) and the lack of a clear semantic relationship, this invariant is likely a coincidence rather than a true invariant of the API. Therefore, it is classified as a "false-positive" with moderate confidence.

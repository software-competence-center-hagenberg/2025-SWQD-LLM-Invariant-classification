### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `resourceURI` (a string representing the canonical URL identifier for the comic) and an `events` object, which includes a `collectionURI` (a string representing the path to the full list of events related to the comic).

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.resourceURI` is a substring of `return.events.collectionURI`. This suggests that the `resourceURI` for a comic is always a part of the `collectionURI` for the events related to that comic.

### Analysis
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 11,650 examples were observed, with 7,623 distinct examples supporting the invariant.
- **Example Values**: The provided examples consistently show that the `resourceURI` is indeed a substring of the `collectionURI`, with the latter simply appending `/events` to the former.
- **Semantic Analysis**: The `resourceURI` represents the base URL for the comic, while the `collectionURI` for events logically extends this URL to point to a related resource (events associated with the comic). This structure is consistent with RESTful API design, where related resources are often represented as extensions of a base resource URL.
- **Specification Consistency**: The swagger definition does not explicitly contradict this invariant. The design of the API, as described, supports the notion that the `collectionURI` for events would naturally include the `resourceURI` as a base path.

### Conclusion
Given the empirical evidence, the semantic alignment with RESTful design principles, and the lack of any specification contradictions, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive." The invariant logically follows from the structure of the API as described in the swagger definition and is supported by a large number of consistent examples.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has `stories` and `events` objects. Both `stories` and `events` have an `available` property, which is an integer representing the total number of available stories or events, respectively.

The documentation specifies that the `available` count for both `stories` and `events` will always be greater than or equal to the `returned` value, but it does not specify any relationship between the `available` counts of `stories` and `events` themselves.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.stories.available >= return.events.available`

This invariant suggests that for every comic fetched, the number of available stories is always greater than or equal to the number of available events.

### Analysis

- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 66 distinct examples supporting this invariant.
- **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant compares two unrelated properties (`stories.available` and `events.available`). The API documentation does not suggest any inherent relationship between the number of stories and the number of events. These are two separate aspects of a comic and could logically vary independently.
- **Specification**: The specification does not mention any relationship between `stories.available` and `events.available`. The invariant seems to be an observation rather than a rule enforced by the API.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of specification support and the semantic independence of `stories` and `events`, the invariant appears to be a coincidental observation rather than a true invariant. Despite the empirical evidence, the lack of logical or documented support for this relationship suggests that it is a "false-positive." The invariant might hold for the current dataset but is not guaranteed by the API's design or documentation.

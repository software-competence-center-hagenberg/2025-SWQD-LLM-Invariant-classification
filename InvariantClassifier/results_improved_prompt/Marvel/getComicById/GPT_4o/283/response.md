### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have a `collectedIssues` array and a `prices` array. The `collectedIssues` array lists issues collected in the comic, while the `prices` array lists different prices for the comic.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`size(return.collectedIssues[]) % size(return.prices[]) == 0`

This invariant suggests that the number of collected issues is always a multiple of the number of prices.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `collectedIssues` and `prices` arrays represent different aspects of a comic. The `collectedIssues` array lists issues included in the comic, while the `prices` array lists different pricing options (e.g., print, digital). There is no inherent semantic relationship that suggests the number of collected issues should be a multiple of the number of prices.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 341 examples were observed, with 228 distinct examples supporting the invariant.

3. **Specification Analysis**: The swagger definition does not specify any relationship between the size of `collectedIssues` and `prices`. The description of `collectedIssues` indicates it is often empty for certain formats, which might suggest variability in its size independent of `prices`.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic relationship between `collectedIssues` and `prices`, and the absence of specification indicating such a relationship, the invariant is likely a coincidence rather than a true invariant. Despite the empirical evidence, the invariant does not logically follow from the API's design or documentation. Therefore, it is classified as a "false-positive".

Confidence in this classification is high due to the clear lack of logical connection between the two fields.

            copyright:

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.copyright)==13

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:

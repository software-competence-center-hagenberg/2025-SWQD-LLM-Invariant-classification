### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` that fetches a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `copyright` field, which is a string containing the copyright notice for the returned result.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.copyright)==13`, which suggests that the `copyright` string in the response always has a length of 13 characters.

### Analysis

- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 11,650 examples supporting this invariant, with only one distinct example provided (`© 2022 MARVEL`).
- **Semantic Consideration**: The copyright field is likely to contain a standard format, such as a copyright symbol, year, and the name of the entity (e.g., "© 2022 MARVEL"). This format could consistently result in a string of length 13 if the entity name and year remain constant.
- **Specification**: The Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the length of the `copyright` field, nor does it mention any variations in the format or content of this field.

### Conclusion

Given the large number of examples and the lack of counterexamples, combined with the plausible fixed format of the copyright notice, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is a "true-positive". However, the confidence is slightly tempered by the lack of explicit constraints in the specification, which leaves open the possibility of future changes to the format.

### Confidence

The confidence in this classification is high, but not absolute, due to the potential for changes in the copyright format that are not captured in the current specification or examples.

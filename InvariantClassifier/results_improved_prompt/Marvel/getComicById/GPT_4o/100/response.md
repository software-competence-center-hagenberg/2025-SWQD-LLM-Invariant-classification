### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have a `creators` object with a `returned` integer indicating the number of creators (up to 20), and a `textObjects` array containing descriptive text blurbs for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.creators.returned >= size(return.textObjects[])-1`.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant compares the number of creators (`creators.returned`) with the number of text objects (`textObjects`). The invariant suggests that the number of creators is always greater than or equal to the number of text objects minus one.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not provide any direct relationship between the number of creators and the number of text objects. The `creators.returned` field is capped at 20, but there is no mention of a limit or specific relationship with `textObjects`.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: Out of 100 calls, no counterexamples were found, and 96 examples supported the invariant, with 63 distinct examples. This suggests a strong empirical backing for the invariant.

4. **Logical Consistency**: The invariant logically implies that the number of creators is generally higher or equal to the number of text objects minus one. This could be a result of how comics are structured, where creators are often numerous compared to the number of text blurbs.

### Conclusion
While the empirical evidence strongly supports the invariant, the lack of a direct relationship in the specification between `creators.returned` and `textObjects` suggests that this invariant might not hold universally across all possible data sets. However, given the strong empirical evidence and the plausible logical connection, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a "true-positive" with moderate confidence.

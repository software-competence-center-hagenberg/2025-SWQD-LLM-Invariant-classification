### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `pageCount` (an integer representing the number of story pages in the comic) and a `prices` array (a list of price objects, each with a `type` and `price`).

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.pageCount != size(return.prices[])`, which asserts that the number of pages in the comic (`pageCount`) is not equal to the number of price entries in the `prices` array.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Relationship**: The `pageCount` represents the number of story pages in a comic, while `prices` represents different pricing options for the comic. There is no inherent semantic relationship between the number of pages and the number of price entries. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that these two values are independent of each other.

2. **Examples and Calls**: The invariant was tested with 50 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 22 distinct examples were observed, all supporting the invariant.

3. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not suggest any relationship between `pageCount` and `prices`. The `prices` array can vary independently of the `pageCount`, as it depends on the number of pricing options available for the comic (e.g., print, digital, etc.), not the number of pages.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic relationship between `pageCount` and `prices`, the invariant `return.pageCount != size(return.prices[])` is likely to be a "true-positive". The invariant holds across all tested examples, and there is no indication from the specification that these two fields should be related in a way that would violate the invariant.

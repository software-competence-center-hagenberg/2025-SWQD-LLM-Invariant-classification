### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The `comicId` is a required path parameter of type integer. The response, upon a successful call (HTTP 200), includes a `data` object which contains a `results` array. Each item in this `results` array can have a `textObjects` array, which includes objects with properties such as `type`, `language`, and `text`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `input.comicId > size(return.textObjects[])`. This suggests that the `comicId` is always greater than the number of `textObjects` returned in the response.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `comicId` is an identifier for a comic, and its value is likely unrelated to the number of `textObjects` associated with that comic. The `textObjects` array represents descriptive text blurbs, which can vary independently of the `comicId`.

2. **Swagger Definition**: The swagger definition does not specify any relationship between `comicId` and the number of `textObjects`. The `comicId` is simply an identifier, while `textObjects` is a collection of text blurbs.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 5,091 distinct examples supported the invariant.

4. **Logical Consistency**: While the empirical evidence is strong, the logical relationship between `comicId` and `textObjects` is not inherently clear from the API definition. The `comicId` is an arbitrary identifier, and its numerical value does not logically correlate with the number of text blurbs.

### Conclusion

Despite the strong empirical evidence, the invariant appears to be coincidental rather than logically necessary. The lack of a semantic relationship between `comicId` and `textObjects` suggests that this invariant is a "false-positive". The invariant holds in the tested cases, but it is not guaranteed by the API's design or specification.

**Confidence**: 0.7

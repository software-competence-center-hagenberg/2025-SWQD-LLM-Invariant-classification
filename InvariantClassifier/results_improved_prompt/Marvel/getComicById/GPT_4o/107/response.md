### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have `stories` and `textObjects` properties. The `stories` object has an `available` integer indicating the number of stories, and `textObjects` is an array of objects each containing a `type`, `language`, and `text`.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.stories.available >= size(return.textObjects[])`. This suggests that the number of available stories is always greater than or equal to the number of text objects.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `available` field in `stories` represents the number of stories available, while `textObjects` represents descriptive text blurbs. There is no direct semantic relationship between the number of stories and the number of text blurbs, as they serve different purposes.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 500 calls, and no counterexamples were found. There are 431 examples supporting the invariant, with 333 distinct examples.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not explicitly state any relationship between `stories.available` and the size of `textObjects`. The invariant seems to be an empirical observation rather than a rule derived from the API's intended behavior.

4. **Statistical Likelihood**: Given the number of calls and examples, it is statistically likely that the invariant holds true for the current dataset. However, without a semantic or specification-based reason for the invariant, it may not be universally true.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.stories.available >= size(return.textObjects[])` is likely a "false-positive" due to the lack of semantic or specification-based justification for the relationship between the number of stories and text objects. The empirical evidence is strong, but it may not cover all possible cases or future changes in the API.

**Confidence**: 0.7

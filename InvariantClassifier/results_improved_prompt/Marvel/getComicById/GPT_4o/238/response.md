### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic by its ID. The response schema includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have `textObjects` and `collectedIssues` arrays.

- **textObjects**: This is an array of descriptive text blurbs for the comic. Each text object has properties like `type`, `language`, and `text`.
- **collectedIssues**: This is an array of issues collected in the comic. Each issue has properties like `resourceURI` and `name`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`size(return.textObjects[]) >= size(return.collectedIssues[])`

This invariant suggests that for every comic fetched, the number of text objects is greater than or equal to the number of collected issues.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - **textObjects**: These are descriptive texts related to the comic. It is reasonable to assume that a comic could have multiple descriptive texts, such as solicit text, preview text, etc.
   - **collectedIssues**: These are issues that are part of the comic. For periodical formats like comics or magazines, this array is generally empty.

2. **Swagger Specification**:
   - The specification mentions that `collectedIssues` will generally be empty for periodical formats such as "comic" or "magazine". This implies that the size of `collectedIssues` is often zero.
   - There is no specific mention of the number of `textObjects`, but it is plausible for a comic to have multiple text blurbs.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests that the invariant holds consistently across the tested samples.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic understanding of the fields and the empirical evidence from the tests, the invariant `size(return.textObjects[]) >= size(return.collectedIssues[])` appears to be a reasonable assumption. The specification supports the idea that `collectedIssues` is often empty, which naturally satisfies the invariant.

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive** with high confidence.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response includes a `data` object that contains a `results` array. Within each result, there is an `events` object that has an `available` integer property, which indicates the number of available events. Additionally, there is a `dates` array that contains objects with `date` and `type` properties.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the number of available events (`return.events.available`) is less than the size of the dates array minus one (`size(return.dates[]) - 1`). This can be expressed as:

`return.events.available < size(return.dates[]) - 1`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the number of available events should always be less than the number of dates minus one. This implies that if there are no dates, the available events should be negative, which is not possible since `available` is an integer that is always greater than or equal to zero.

2. **Data Observations**: The provided examples show that `events.available` is consistently `0`, while the `dates` array contains at least two date entries in all examples. This means that `size(return.dates[])` is at least `2`, leading to `size(return.dates[]) - 1` being at least `1`. Thus, the invariant holds true in the provided examples.

3. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 500 calls without finding a counterexample, and there are 650 examples supporting the invariant. However, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant is universally true, especially if the API can return different data under different conditions.

4. **Potential Edge Cases**: If there are cases where there are no dates returned (i.e., `size(return.dates[])` is `0`), then the invariant would fail since `0 < -1` is false. The API documentation does not explicitly state that there will always be dates returned, which raises the possibility of such edge cases.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, while the invariant holds true for the tested examples, the potential for edge cases where no dates are returned means that the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

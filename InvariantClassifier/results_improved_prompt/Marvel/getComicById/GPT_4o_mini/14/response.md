### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that fetches a single comic by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `data.results` property is an array of comic objects, each containing a `digitalId` field, which is an integer. The description specifies that `digitalId` will be `0` if the comic is not available digitally.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.digitalId >= 0`, meaning that the `digitalId` should always be greater than or equal to `0`.

### Analysis
Given that the Swagger definition explicitly states that `digitalId` will be `0` if the comic is not available digitally, this means that `digitalId` can indeed take the value of `0`. Since the invariant states that `digitalId` must be greater than or equal to `0`, it holds true for `0` as well as for any positive integer values. 

The fact that there were no counterexamples found in 10,000 calls strengthens the case for this invariant being a true-positive. The presence of 11,650 examples, with 6,069 distinct values, further supports the reliability of this invariant. 

### Conclusion
Since the invariant correctly captures the behavior described in the API specification and has been validated by a significant number of calls without counterexamples, it is classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the lack of counterexamples and the clear definition in the API documentation.

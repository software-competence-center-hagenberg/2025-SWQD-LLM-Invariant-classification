### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a data object, which includes a results array. Each item in the results array can contain a textObjects array, which is described as a set of descriptive text blurbs for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array can only be one of the values {0, 1, 2}. This means that for any valid response from the API, the `textObjects` array should never have more than 2 items.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The invariant is based on the structure of the response, specifically the `textObjects` array within the `results` array. The invariant restricts the possible sizes of this array to a maximum of 2.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 500 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 431 examples were collected, with 333 distinct examples, all of which adhered to the invariant.
3. **Specification Considerations**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state any limits on the number of `textObjects` that can be returned, which means that the API could potentially return more than 2 items in the `textObjects` array. Since the specification does not restrict the number of items, this raises a concern about the validity of the invariant.

### Conclusion
While the empirical evidence suggests that the invariant holds true for the tested cases, the lack of explicit restrictions in the API specification means that it is possible for future responses to include more than 2 `textObjects`. Therefore, the invariant is likely a false-positive, as it does not account for all possible valid responses from the API. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

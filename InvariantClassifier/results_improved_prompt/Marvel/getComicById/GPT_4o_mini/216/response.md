### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that fetches a comic resource by its ID. The response includes two properties: `attributionText` and `attributionHTML`. Both properties are strings, with `attributionHTML` providing an HTML representation of the attribution notice, which includes the `attributionText` as part of its content.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.attributionText` is a substring of `return.attributionHTML`. This means that the text provided in `attributionText` should appear within the HTML string of `attributionHTML`.

### Analysis
Given the example values provided:
- `output.attributionText = "Data provided by Marvel. © 2022 MARVEL"`
- `output.attributionHTML = "<a href=\"http://marvel.com\">Data provided by Marvel. © 2022 MARVEL</a>"`

We can see that the `attributionText` indeed appears within the `attributionHTML` string. The invariant holds true for this example. 

The fact that 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample strongly suggests that this invariant is consistently upheld across various requests. The presence of 11,650 examples in the request data further supports the likelihood that this invariant is valid, as it indicates a high frequency of similar responses.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the API specification, the provided example, and the extensive testing without counterexamples, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The invariant logically follows from the API's design, where the HTML representation is expected to include the plain text attribution notice. 

**Verdict:** true-positive
**Confidence:** 0.95

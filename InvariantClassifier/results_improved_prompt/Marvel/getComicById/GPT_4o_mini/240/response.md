### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that it returns an object containing a `data` property, which in turn contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array has two properties of interest: `urls` (an array of URL objects) and `collectedIssues` (an array of collected issues).

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `urls` array minus one is greater than or equal to the size of the `collectedIssues` array, expressed as:

`size(return.urls[]) - 1 >= size(return.collectedIssues[])`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `return.urls[]`: This represents the array of URLs associated with the comic resource.
   - `return.collectedIssues[]`: This represents the array of issues collected in the comic.

2. **Logical Implications**:
   - The invariant suggests that for every comic fetched, the number of URLs should be at least one more than the number of collected issues. This could imply that there is always at least one URL available for each comic, and that there may or may not be collected issues.
   - Given that the description states that `collectedIssues` will generally be empty for periodical formats, it is reasonable to assume that there will often be at least one URL present.

3. **Testing and Evidence**:
   - The invariant has been tested with 100 calls without finding a counterexample. This suggests a strong correlation between the two arrays in the context of the API's behavior.
   - However, the absence of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant holds universally, especially if the API can return comics that might not conform to this pattern under certain conditions.

### Conclusion
While the invariant appears to hold true based on the current testing and the API's description, there is a possibility that edge cases or specific comic types could violate this invariant. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** due to the potential for exceptions that have not yet been encountered in testing. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.75

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can contain two properties: `textObjects` (an array of descriptive text blurbs) and `images` (an array of promotional images).

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array minus one should be less than or equal to the size of the `images` array. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as: 

`size(return.textObjects) - 1 <= size(return.images)`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that for every comic fetched, the number of descriptive text blurbs (minus one) should not exceed the number of promotional images associated with that comic. This implies a relationship between the two arrays.

2. **Data from Calls**: The invariant has been tested against 1000 calls without finding a counterexample, which is a strong indication that it may hold true. Additionally, having 1104 examples with 661 distinct examples suggests a reasonable diversity in the data.

3. **Semantic Consideration**: The invariant seems to make sense semantically, as it implies that for every additional text object, there should be at least one corresponding image. However, it does not explicitly contradict any part of the API specification, which does not impose any specific limits on the relationship between `textObjects` and `images`.

4. **Potential Edge Cases**: While the invariant holds for the tested cases, it is important to consider edge cases. For instance, if a comic has no images but multiple text objects, the invariant would fail. However, the absence of counterexamples in the tested calls suggests that such cases may not be common or that the API is designed to ensure this relationship holds.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of counterexamples in the tested calls and the reasonable semantic relationship implied by the invariant, it is classified as a **true-positive**. However, it is essential to remain cautious about potential edge cases that could arise in future requests. 

**Verdict**: true-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

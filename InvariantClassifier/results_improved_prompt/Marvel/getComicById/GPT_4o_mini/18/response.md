### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array contains a `textObjects` array, which is described as a set of descriptive text blurbs for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that all elements in the `textObjects` array are not null: `return.textObjects[] elements != null`. This means that for every comic fetched, the `textObjects` array should not contain any null elements.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `textObjects` can contain null elements. It describes `textObjects` as a set of descriptive text blurbs, which implies that they should contain valid text objects.
2. **Testing Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample. This suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true across valid requests.
3. **Specification Clarity**: The specification does not contradict the invariant, as it does not mention that null values are permissible in the `textObjects` array.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of counterexamples in extensive testing and the alignment of the invariant with the provided API specification, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. The invariant appears to hold for every valid request on the API, and there is no indication from the specification that null elements are allowed in the `textObjects` array.

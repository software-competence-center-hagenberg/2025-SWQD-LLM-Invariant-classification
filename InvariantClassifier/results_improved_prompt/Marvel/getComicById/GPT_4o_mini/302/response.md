### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a comic resource by its ID. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that the `images` property is an array of objects, each containing an `extension` property, which is a string representing the file extension of the image.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `extension` field can only take on the values "jpg" or "png". This is a restriction on the possible values of the `extension` property in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Data Collection**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true for the API's behavior.
2. **Distinct Examples**: Out of 17,355 examples, only 2 distinct values were found: "png" and "jpg". This further supports the idea that the `extension` values are limited to these two formats.
3. **Specification Review**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly mention any other possible values for the `extension` field, which aligns with the invariant's claim.
4. **Semantic Context**: The context of the API, which deals with comic images, typically supports the idea that common image formats like "jpg" and "png" would be used, making the invariant semantically reasonable.

### Conclusion
Given the extensive testing, the limited distinct values observed, and the lack of contradictory information in the Swagger definition, the invariant "return.extension one of { "jpg", "png" }" is classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the strong evidence supporting the invariant's validity.

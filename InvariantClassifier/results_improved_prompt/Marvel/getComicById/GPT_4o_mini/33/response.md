### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `thumbnail` object, which in turn has an `extension` property of type string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `extension` property of the `thumbnail` object in the response will always be equal to `"jpg"`. This is a very specific condition that restricts the possible values of the `extension` property to only one value.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The response structure allows for a `thumbnail` object with an `extension` property. However, the Swagger definition does not specify that the `extension` can only be `"jpg"`. It simply defines it as a string.
2. **Distinct Examples**: Although 1000 calls did not yield a counterexample, the fact that there is only one distinct example of `"jpg"` among 1650 examples raises a concern. This could indicate that the API is currently returning only `"jpg"`, but it does not guarantee that it will always do so in the future.
3. **Specification Flexibility**: The specification does not explicitly restrict the `extension` to `"jpg"`. Other image formats (like `"png"`, `"gif"`, etc.) could be valid extensions for thumbnails, especially in a comic context where various image formats might be used.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the `extension` to a single value without explicit support from the API specification, and considering the potential for other valid values, this invariant is likely a **false-positive**. The API could return different image formats in the future, which would violate the invariant. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a false-positive with high confidence.

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.9

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `data.results` object contains two fields of interest: `digitalId` and `stories.returned`. The `digitalId` is an integer that represents the ID of the digital comic, while `stories.returned` is an integer that indicates the number of stories returned in the collection.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.digitalId != return.stories.returned`, meaning that the digital ID of the comic should not be equal to the number of stories returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Contextual Relevance**: The two fields being compared (`digitalId` and `stories.returned`) serve different purposes. The `digitalId` is an identifier for the comic, while `stories.returned` counts the number of stories associated with that comic. There is no inherent relationship between these two values that would necessitate them being unequal.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests that it holds true for the tested cases. Additionally, the presence of 6,088 distinct examples further supports the reliability of this invariant in the tested scenarios.

3. **Specification Consideration**: The API specification does not explicitly state that `digitalId` and `stories.returned` must be different. Since `digitalId` can be any integer (including 0) and `stories.returned` can also be any integer (up to 20), there is a possibility that they could be equal in some cases, especially if the `digitalId` happens to be a small integer.

### Conclusion
While the invariant has shown strong empirical support, the lack of a definitive relationship between `digitalId` and `stories.returned` in the API specification means that it is possible for them to be equal in some cases. Therefore, the invariant is likely a false-positive, as it does not hold universally for all valid requests to the API.

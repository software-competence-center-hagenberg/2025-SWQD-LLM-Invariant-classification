### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that fetches a comic resource by its ID. The response includes a property called `copyright`, which is a string. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `copyright` string in the response is always 13 characters: `LENGTH(return.copyright)==13`. 

### Analysis
1. **Length of Copyright**: The example value provided for `output.copyright` is `Â© 2022 MARVEL`, which has a length of 15 characters, not 13. This directly contradicts the invariant. 
2. **Counterexamples**: Despite having tried 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, the single example provided already disproves the invariant. The presence of a single counterexample is sufficient to classify the invariant as incorrect. 
3. **Specification**: The specification does not restrict the length of the `copyright` string to 13 characters; thus, it can vary. 

### Conclusion
Given that the example provided contradicts the invariant and the specification allows for variability in the length of the `copyright` string, the invariant is classified as a false-positive. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

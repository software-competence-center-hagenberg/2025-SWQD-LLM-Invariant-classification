### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `data.results` object contains a `digitalId` and a `prices` array. The `digitalId` is an integer that represents the ID of the digital comic, and it will be `0` if the comic is not available digitally. The `prices` array contains objects that represent different prices for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.digitalId != size(return.prices[])`, meaning that the digital ID of the comic should not equal the number of price entries in the `prices` array.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `digitalId` is an integer that can be `0` if the comic is not available digitally. The `prices` array can have multiple entries, including scenarios where there are no prices (an empty array).
2. **Possible Values**: 
   - If `digitalId` is `0`, and if there are no prices, then `size(prices)` would be `0`, leading to `0 != 0`, which is false.
   - If `digitalId` is a positive integer and there are no prices, then `size(prices)` would be `0`, leading to `digitalId != 0`, which is true.
   - If `digitalId` is a positive integer and there is at least one price, then `size(prices)` would be at least `1`, leading to `digitalId != size(prices)`, which could be true or false depending on the specific values.
3. **Counterexamples**: The invariant fails in cases where `digitalId` is `0` and `prices` is empty, as well as potentially when `digitalId` equals the number of prices.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant does not hold in all cases, particularly when `digitalId` is `0` and there are no prices, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear logical reasoning and the potential for counterexamples.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `data.results` object contains a `pageCount` property (an integer representing the number of story pages in the comic) and a `prices` property (an array of price objects for the comic). 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `pageCount` of the comic must be divisible by the number of prices available for that comic, expressed as `return.pageCount % size(return.prices[]) == 0`. This means that the number of pages in the comic should be evenly distributed among the prices listed. 

### Analysis
1. **Logical Consistency**: The invariant suggests a relationship between the number of pages in a comic and the number of price entries. However, there is no inherent logical reason why the number of pages should be divisible by the number of prices. A comic can have any number of pages regardless of how many pricing options are available. 
2. **Empirical Evidence**: Although 1000 calls were made without finding a counterexample, this does not guarantee that the invariant holds universally. The absence of counterexamples in a limited sample does not imply that the invariant is true for all possible cases. 
3. **Distinct Examples**: The 1650 examples with 146 distinct values provide some evidence, but they do not conclusively support the invariant. The examples provided show a variety of `pageCount` and `prices` combinations, but they do not establish a necessary condition that `pageCount` must be divisible by the number of prices. 

### Conclusion
Given the lack of a logical basis for the invariant and the fact that it does not hold universally across all possible comic resources, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the reasoning provided and the nature of the relationship between `pageCount` and `prices` not being inherently linked.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Within this array, there are two properties of interest: `textObjects` and `stories`. 

- `textObjects`: An array of objects that contain descriptive text blurbs for the comic.
- `stories`: An object that contains an array of returned stories in this collection.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array minus one is less than or equal to the size of the `stories.items` array minus one. In simpler terms, it asserts that the number of text objects is always less than or equal to the number of stories returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Relationship**: The invariant suggests a relationship between the number of text objects and the number of stories. However, there is no explicit semantic relationship defined in the API specification that guarantees that the number of text objects will always be less than or equal to the number of stories. 
2. **Counterexamples**: While no counterexamples were found in the 500 calls made, this does not necessarily imply that the invariant is universally true. The absence of counterexamples in a limited number of calls does not guarantee that the invariant will hold for all possible inputs. 
3. **Specification Clarity**: The specification does not provide any constraints or rules that would enforce this relationship, which raises doubts about the validity of the invariant. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant asserts a specific relationship between two collections without clear support from the API specification, and considering that the absence of counterexamples in a limited number of calls does not confirm its validity, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is moderate due to the lack of explicit contradiction in the specification but high due to the absence of a semantic basis for the invariant.

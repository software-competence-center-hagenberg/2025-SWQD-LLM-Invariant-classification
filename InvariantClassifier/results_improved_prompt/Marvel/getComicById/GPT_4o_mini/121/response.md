### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have two properties: `textObjects` and `dates`, both of which are arrays.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array must be less than or equal to the size of the `dates` array minus one: `size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.dates[]) - 1`. This implies that there should always be at least one more date than text object in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Logical Consistency**: The invariant suggests a specific relationship between the number of text objects and dates. However, the API documentation does not specify any constraints or relationships between these two fields. It is possible for a comic to have more text objects than dates, or vice versa, depending on the comic's metadata.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 96 examples in the request data, with 63 distinct examples. While this suggests a strong correlation, it does not guarantee that the invariant holds universally for all possible responses.
3. **Potential Counterexamples**: Without explicit constraints in the API documentation, it is conceivable that there could be cases where the number of text objects exceeds the number of dates, especially if a comic has multiple text descriptions but only a single key date.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant imposes a specific relationship that is not supported by the API's documentation and could potentially be violated by certain comic resources, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The lack of counterexamples in the tested calls does not sufficiently establish the invariant as universally valid, especially considering the possibility of untested edge cases. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

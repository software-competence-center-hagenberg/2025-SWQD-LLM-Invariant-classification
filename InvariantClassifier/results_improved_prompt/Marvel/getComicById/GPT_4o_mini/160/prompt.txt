Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}"
  get:
    summary: Fetches a single comic by id.
    description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: object
              properties:
                total:
                  type: integer
                  description: The total number of resources available given the current filter set.
              properties:
                count:
                  type: integer
                  description: The total number of results returned by this call.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.data.total == return.data.count

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two long scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:
output.data.total=1; output.data.count=1

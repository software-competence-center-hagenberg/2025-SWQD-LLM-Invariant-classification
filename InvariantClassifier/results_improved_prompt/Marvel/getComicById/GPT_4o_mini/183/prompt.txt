Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.path is Url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsUrl
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable is always a URL. Represented as x is Url.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results.images" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 19977 examples in the requests data, with 12707 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `issueNumber` is a property of the items in the `results` array, which is expected to be a number. The description states that the `issueNumber` will generally be 0 for collection formats, implying that the minimum value for `issueNumber` is 0.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.issueNumber >= 0.0`, which means that the `issueNumber` should always be greater than or equal to 0.0.

### Analysis
- The invariant aligns with the description provided in the API documentation, which suggests that `issueNumber` will generally be 0 for collection formats. 
- The fact that there have been 500 calls made without finding a counterexample strengthens the case for this invariant being a true-positive. 
- Additionally, the 650 examples collected, with all values being greater than or equal to 40, further supports the invariant. 
- There is no indication in the API documentation that `issueNumber` could be negative, and the examples provided do not contradict the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the alignment of the invariant with the API documentation, the lack of counterexamples in the tested calls, and the supporting examples, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the substantial evidence supporting the invariant.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}"
  get:
    summary: Fetches a single comic by id.
    description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':

                      type: number
                      description: The number of the issue in the series (will generally be 0 for collection formats).


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.issueNumber >= 0.0

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.LowerBoundFloat
Invariant description: Represents the invariant x >= c, where c is a constant and x is a double scalar.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 500 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 650 examples in the requests data, with 149 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.data.results.issueNumber=40
output.data.results.issueNumber=42
output.data.results.issueNumber=43
output.data.results.issueNumber=44
output.data.results.issueNumber=45

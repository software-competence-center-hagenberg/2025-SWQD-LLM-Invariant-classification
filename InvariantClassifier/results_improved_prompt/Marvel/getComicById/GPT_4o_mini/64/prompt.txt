Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.comicId > size(return.variants[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 2031 examples in the requests data, with 1313 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.comicId=77124; output.data.results.variants=[{"name":"Daredevil (2019) #14 (Variant)","resourceURI":"http:\/\/gateway.marvel.com\/v1\/public\/comics\/83271"}]
input.comicId=24810; output.data.results.variants=[{"name":"Dark Avengers (2009) #6 (Young Gun)","resourceURI":"http:\/\/gateway.marvel.com\/v1\/public\/comics\/24811"}]
input.comicId=83996; output.data.results.variants=[{"name":"Atlantis Attacks (2020) #5 (Variant)","resourceURI":"http:\/\/gateway.marvel.com\/v1\/public\/comics\/89920"}]
input.comicId=40170; output.data.results.variants=[{"name":"New Mutants (2009) #23","resourceURI":"http:\/\/gateway.marvel.com\/v1\/public\/comics\/36502"}]
input.comicId=23115; output.data.results.variants=[{"name":"Skaar: Son of Hulk (2008) #7 (2nd Printing Variant)","resourceURI":"http:\/\/gateway.marvel.com\/v1\/public\/comics\/24532"}]

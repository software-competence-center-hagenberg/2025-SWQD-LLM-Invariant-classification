### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in this array can have an `images` array, and each image has an `extension` property that is a string. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `extension` of the returned images is always equal to "jpg". This is a very restrictive condition, implying that no other image formats are allowed in the response. 

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly limit the `extension` property to only "jpg". It simply describes the structure of the response without specifying the allowed values for the `extension`. 
2. **Testing Results**: The invariant has been tested with 1000 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests that in the tested cases, the `extension` was consistently "jpg". However, the fact that there is only one distinct example among 2622 requests raises a concern. It indicates that while the current data supports the invariant, it does not conclusively prove that other values cannot exist. 
3. **Potential for Other Values**: Since the specification does not restrict the `extension` to just "jpg", it is possible that other formats (e.g., "png", "gif") could be valid responses. The lack of counterexamples in the tested calls does not guarantee that they do not exist in other scenarios or future responses. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the `extension` to only one value without explicit support from the API specification, it is likely a false-positive. The testing results do not provide enough evidence to conclude that the invariant holds universally across all valid requests. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** with a confidence of 0.85 due to the lack of explicit restrictions in the API documentation.

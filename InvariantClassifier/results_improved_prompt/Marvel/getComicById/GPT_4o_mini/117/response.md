### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic by its ID. The response includes a `data` object containing a `results` array, which has properties for `events` and `images`. The `events` object has an `available` integer that indicates the number of total available events, while the `images` array contains promotional images associated with the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the number of available events (`return.events.available`) is less than or equal to the size of the images array (`size(return.images[])`). This is represented as `return.events.available <= size(return.images[])`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The invariant compares the number of available events to the number of images. This makes sense semantically, as both are counts related to the comic resource.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 1000 calls without finding a counterexample, and there are 1588 examples in the request data, with 944 distinct examples. This suggests that the invariant holds true across a wide range of cases.
3. **Logical Consideration**: The invariant logically implies that if there are no events available (i.e., `available` is 0), it is still valid as long as there are images present. However, if there are more events available than images, the invariant would not hold. The invariant does not contradict the specification, as it does not restrict the values of `available` or the number of images in a way that is explicitly stated in the API documentation.

### Conclusion
Given the strong empirical evidence supporting the invariant and the logical consistency with the API's purpose, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the lack of counterexamples and the semantic relevance of the variables being compared.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that fetches a comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `data` object containing a `results` array, which in turn contains `textObjects`. Each `textObject` has a `language` property that is a string representing the language of the text object.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `language` property of the `textObjects` in the response will always be equal to `"en-us"`. This is a very specific condition that restricts the possible values of the `language` field to only one value.

### Analysis
1. **Frequency of Calls**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found, which suggests that the invariant holds in the tested cases.
2. **Distinct Examples**: Out of 9,361 examples, only 1 distinct example was found, which is `"en-us"`. This indicates a lack of variety in the responses, but does not necessarily confirm that `"en-us"` is the only possible value.
3. **Specification Considerations**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that the `language` must be `"en-us"`. It only describes the `language` as an IETF language tag, which implies that other languages could potentially be valid values. The invariant restricts the `language` to a single value, which is not supported by the specification.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the `language` to only `"en-us"` without any explicit support from the API specification and considering that the specification allows for the possibility of other languages, this invariant is likely a false-positive. The lack of counterexamples does not definitively prove that no other values are possible, especially since the specification does not limit the `language` to just `"en-us"`. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** with a confidence of 0.85 due to the strong evidence from the testing but the lack of explicit support from the API documentation.

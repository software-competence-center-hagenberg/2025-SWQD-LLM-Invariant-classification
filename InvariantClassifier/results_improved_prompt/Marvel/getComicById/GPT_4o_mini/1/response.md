### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that fetches a single comic by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `prices` array, which in turn contains items that have a `type` field.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `type` field in the `prices` array can only take on the values `"digitalPurchasePrice"` or `"printPrice"`. This is expressed as:  
`return.type one of { "digitalPurchasePrice", "printPrice" }`

### Analysis
The invariant is based on the observed values from the API responses. With 10,000 calls made without finding a counterexample, and 17,843 examples of the `type` field being recorded with only 2 distinct values, it strongly suggests that the invariant holds true for the current implementation of the API. 

However, we must consider the possibility of future changes to the API. The invariant does not contradict the Swagger definition, which does not specify any other possible values for the `type` field. Therefore, unless the API documentation explicitly states that other values are allowed, the invariant appears to be valid.

### Conclusion
Given the extensive testing and the lack of counterexamples, along with the alignment of the invariant with the current API behavior, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the significant amount of data supporting it.

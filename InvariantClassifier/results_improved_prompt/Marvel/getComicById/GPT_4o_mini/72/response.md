### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `data.results` object contains a `digitalId` (an integer) and a `textObjects` array (which can contain multiple objects with descriptive text about the comic).

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.digitalId >= size(return.textObjects[]) - 1`. This means that the digital ID of the comic must be greater than or equal to the size of the text objects array minus one.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: 
   - `return.digitalId`: This is an integer representing the ID of the digital comic. It can be 0 if the comic is not available digitally.
   - `return.textObjects[]`: This is an array that can contain zero or more text objects. The size of this array can vary.

2. **Invariant Logic**: 
   - If `textObjects` is empty (size 0), the invariant would require `digitalId >= -1`, which is always true since `digitalId` is a non-negative integer.
   - If `textObjects` has one item (size 1), the invariant would require `digitalId >= 0`, which is also true since `digitalId` can be 0.
   - If `textObjects` has two items (size 2), the invariant would require `digitalId >= 1`, which is still possible since `digitalId` can be any positive integer.
   - The invariant seems to hold for all tested cases, as indicated by the 100 calls without counterexamples.

3. **Counterexamples**: 
   - The invariant has been tested with 100 calls and no counterexamples were found, which suggests a strong likelihood of it being valid.
   - However, the invariant's correctness is contingent on the relationship between `digitalId` and the size of `textObjects`, which may not be explicitly defined in the API documentation. If the API allows for cases where `digitalId` could be less than the size of `textObjects` (for example, if there are comics with multiple text objects but a low or zero digital ID), the invariant could fail.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of counterexamples and the logical consistency of the invariant with the provided data, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. However, there remains a slight uncertainty due to the potential for edge cases not covered in the tested examples. Therefore, I assign a confidence level of 0.85 to this classification.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}"
  get:
    summary: Fetches a single comic by id.
    description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
    parameters:
      - name: comicId
        in: path
        description: A single comic.
        required: true
        type: integer
        format: int32
    responses:
      '200':
        description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
        schema:

            data:

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.comicId > return.data.limit

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 1000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 1650 examples in the requests data, with 979 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.comicId=90137; output.data.limit=20
input.comicId=97261; output.data.limit=20
input.comicId=64197; output.data.limit=20
input.comicId=47150; output.data.limit=20
input.comicId=98328; output.data.limit=20

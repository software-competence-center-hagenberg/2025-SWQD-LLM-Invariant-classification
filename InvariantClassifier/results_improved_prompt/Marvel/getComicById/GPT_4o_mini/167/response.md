### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that fetches a comic resource by its ID. The response includes a property called `attributionText`, which is a string that serves as an attribution notice for the comic data fetched from the API.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `attributionText` should always equal "Data provided by Marvel. \\251 2022 MARVEL". This is a very specific string value that the response is expected to return.

### Analysis
1. **Response Consistency**: The invariant claims that `attributionText` will always return a specific string. However, the example provided in the request data shows that the actual output is "Data provided by Marvel. © 2022 MARVEL". The presence of the character "©" instead of the expected "\251" indicates that there is a discrepancy in the expected output.
2. **Distinct Values**: The invariant suggests that `attributionText` can only take on one specific value, but the example shows that there are variations in the output (e.g., the character encoding issue). This suggests that the invariant may not hold true for all cases.
3. **Multiple Examples**: While 11650 examples were found, the fact that there is at least one distinct example indicates that the invariant may not be universally applicable. The presence of variations in the output suggests that the API can return different values for `attributionText`.

### Conclusion
Given the discrepancy between the invariant and the actual output observed in the API responses, as well as the presence of distinct examples, it is clear that the invariant does not hold true for all valid requests. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the evidence provided by the example outputs.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which in turn contains a `results` array. The `results` array is described as containing a list of comics returned by the call, and each item in this array can have an `events` object.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.events != null`, which implies that for every comic returned in the `results` array, the `events` property should not be null.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that every comic in the `results` array will have an `events` object that is not null. This is a strong assertion, as it implies that the API guarantees the presence of the `events` object for every comic.
2. **Swagger Definition Context**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that the `events` object must be present or non-null for every comic. It only describes the structure of the response and mentions that `results` is an array of comic objects. Without explicit constraints in the definition, it is possible that some comic objects may not have an `events` object, which could lead to `events` being null.
3. **Empirical Evidence**: The fact that 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true in practice. However, the absence of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant is universally true, especially if the API specification does not enforce this condition.

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition does not explicitly guarantee that `events` will always be non-null for every comic in the `results` array, the invariant is likely a false-positive. While the empirical evidence is strong, the lack of explicit specification support leads to uncertainty. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with a confidence level of **0.85** due to the strong empirical evidence but the lack of explicit specification support.

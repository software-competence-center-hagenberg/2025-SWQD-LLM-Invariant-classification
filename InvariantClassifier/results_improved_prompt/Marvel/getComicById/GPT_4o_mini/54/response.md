### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a REST API endpoint that fetches comic resources by their ID. The response schema indicates that the `data.results` property contains an array of prices for the comic, where each price is represented as an object with `type` and `price` fields.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `return.prices[]` array is one of {1, 2}. This means that for every valid response from the API, the prices array should either contain exactly one or two price objects.

### Analysis
- **Testing and Examples**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found, which strongly suggests that the invariant holds true across all tested cases. Additionally, there are 11,650 examples in the request data, with 106 distinct examples, indicating a robust dataset.
- **Semantic Consideration**: The invariant restricts the number of price entries to either 1 or 2. Given that the API is designed to fetch comic resources, it is reasonable to expect that a comic could have multiple pricing options (e.g., print and digital), which aligns with the examples provided. The examples show that there are indeed cases where there are two prices, as well as cases where there is only one price.
- **Specification Review**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that there can be more than two prices, nor does it provide any indication that the prices array could be empty or contain more than two items. This lack of contradiction supports the validity of the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the extensive testing, the nature of the API, and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant that the size of the `return.prices[]` array is one of {1, 2} is classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the significant amount of data supporting it.

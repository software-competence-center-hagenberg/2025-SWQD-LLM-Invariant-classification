### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response structure includes a `data` object containing a `results` array, which in turn contains two properties: `collectedIssues` and `images`. Each of these properties is an array, where `collectedIssues` represents a list of issues collected in the comic, and `images` represents a list of promotional images associated with the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `collectedIssues` array should be less than or equal to the size of the `images` array: `size(return.collectedIssues[]) <= size(return.images[])`. This is expressed as a binary invariant comparing two scalar values (the sizes of the two arrays).

### Analysis
1. **Contextual Understanding**: The invariant suggests a relationship between the number of collected issues and the number of promotional images. However, the specification does not provide any explicit correlation between these two properties. It is possible for a comic to have many images but no collected issues, or vice versa.
2. **Counterexamples**: Although 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample, this does not guarantee that the invariant is universally true. The absence of counterexamples in a limited number of calls does not provide sufficient evidence to claim that the invariant holds for all possible responses.
3. **Semantics**: The semantics of the two properties do not imply a necessary relationship. For instance, a comic could have 0 collected issues and 5 images, which would violate the invariant. Thus, the invariant does not logically follow from the API's response structure.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of a defined relationship between `collectedIssues` and `images`, and the potential for counterexamples based on the semantics of the data, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the reasoning provided and the nature of the data involved.

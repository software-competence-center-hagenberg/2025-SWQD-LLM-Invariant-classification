Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}"
  get:
    summary: Fetches a single comic by id.
    description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
        schema:

                      properties:
                        items:
                          type: array
                          description: The list of returned creators in this collection.
                          items:
                            resourceURI:
                              type: string
                              description: The path to the individual creator resource.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.resourceURI is Url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsUrl
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable is always a URL. Represented as x is Url.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results.creators.items" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 66071 examples in the requests data, with 2968 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.data.results.creators.items.resourceURI=http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/13383
output.data.results.creators.items.resourceURI=http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/8678
output.data.results.creators.items.resourceURI=http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/5169
output.data.results.creators.items.resourceURI=http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/13385

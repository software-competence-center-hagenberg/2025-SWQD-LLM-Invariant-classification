### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `data.results` contains an array of comic stories, and each story object has a property `available`, which is an integer representing the total number of available stories.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.stories.available >= 2`, which asserts that the `available` field in the response will always be greater than or equal to 2.

### Analysis
- **Data from Calls**: The invariant has been tested against 500 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests that it holds true for those requests. Additionally, there are 650 examples of the `available` field, with values consistently above 2 in the provided examples.
- **Specification Context**: The specification does not explicitly state that the `available` value must be at least 2. It only mentions that it will always be greater than or equal to the `returned` value. This implies that there could be scenarios where `available` could be less than 2 if the `returned` value is also less than or equal to 2.
- **Semantics**: The invariant restricts the value of `available`, which is not explicitly supported by the API documentation. While the examples provided do show values greater than or equal to 2, the lack of explicit constraints in the specification means that there could be valid responses where `available` is less than 2.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant is not explicitly supported by the API specification and that the specification allows for the possibility of `available` being less than 2, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is moderate due to the lack of counterexamples but is influenced by the specification's ambiguity regarding the minimum value of `available`. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.7

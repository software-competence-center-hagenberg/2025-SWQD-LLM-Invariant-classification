### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response structure indicates that it returns a `data` object containing a `results` array. Within each item of the `results` array, there are two properties of interest: `textObjects` (an array of descriptive text blurbs) and `urls` (an array of public web site URLs).

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array minus one is less than or equal to the size of the `urls` array minus one, which can be simplified to:

`size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.urls[])`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant implies that for every comic fetched, the number of descriptive text blurbs (`textObjects`) should not exceed the number of URLs (`urls`). This suggests a relationship where each comic should have at least as many URLs as it has text descriptions.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there are 96 examples in the request data, with 63 distinct examples. This indicates a strong correlation between the two arrays across the tested comics.

3. **Specification Considerations**: The API documentation does not explicitly state that there can be more `textObjects` than `urls`. However, it also does not guarantee that the number of `urls` will always be greater than or equal to the number of `textObjects`. There could be cases where a comic has multiple text descriptions but no URLs, which would violate the invariant.

### Conclusion
While the invariant holds true for the tested examples, the lack of explicit constraints in the API specification regarding the relationship between `textObjects` and `urls` means that it is possible for future responses to violate this invariant. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** because it is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API, despite the empirical evidence supporting it in the tested cases.

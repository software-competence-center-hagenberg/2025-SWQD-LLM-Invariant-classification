Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}"
  get:
    summary: Fetches a single comic by id.
    description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
    parameters:
      - name: comicId
        in: path
        description: A single comic.
        required: true
        type: integer
        format: int32
    responses:
      '200':
        description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.

                  items:
                    digitalId:
                      type: integer
                      description: The ID of the digital comic representation of this comic. Will be 0 if the comic is not available digitally.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.comicId != return.digitalId

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two long scalars. Prints as x != y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 7623 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.comicId=5413; output.data.results.digitalId=4082
input.comicId=40855; output.data.results.digitalId=27800
input.comicId=53493; output.data.results.digitalId=36627
input.comicId=55801; output.data.results.digitalId=43433
input.comicId=37458; output.data.results.digitalId=20753

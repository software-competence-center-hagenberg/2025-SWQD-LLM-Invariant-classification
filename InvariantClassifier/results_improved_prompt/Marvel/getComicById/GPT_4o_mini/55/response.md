### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID (`comicId`). The `comicId` is an integer that is required in the path of the request. The response includes a `data` object that contains a `results` array, where each item has a `digitalId` property. This `digitalId` represents the ID of the digital comic representation and can be 0 if the comic is not available digitally.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `comicId` provided in the request should not equal the `digitalId` returned in the response. This is expressed as `input.comicId != return.digitalId`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `comicId` is the identifier for the comic being requested, while `digitalId` is an identifier for the digital representation of that comic. It is possible for a comic to have a `digitalId` that is different from its `comicId`, especially if the comic is not available digitally (in which case `digitalId` could be 0).

2. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests that in all tested cases, the `comicId` was indeed not equal to the `digitalId`.

3. **Specification Considerations**: The specification does not explicitly state that `digitalId` must be different from `comicId`. It only indicates that `digitalId` can be 0 if the comic is not available digitally. Therefore, it is conceivable that there could be cases where `comicId` equals `digitalId`, especially if a comic is available digitally and has the same ID.

4. **Semantics**: The semantics of the variables suggest that while `comicId` and `digitalId` can be different, there is no inherent rule preventing them from being equal. The invariant assumes a strict inequality that may not hold in all cases.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of counterexamples in the tested calls, the invariant appears to hold true for the tested data. However, due to the nature of the identifiers and the possibility of future cases where `comicId` could equal `digitalId`, the invariant cannot be definitively classified as a true-positive. Therefore, it is more prudent to classify this invariant as a **false-positive** due to the potential for exceptions that are not covered by the current data set.

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

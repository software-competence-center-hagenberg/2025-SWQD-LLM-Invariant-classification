### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response structure indicates that each comic has a `digitalId` and a `stories` object that contains an `available` field. The `digitalId` is an integer that represents the ID of the digital comic, while `available` indicates the number of available stories for that comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.digitalId != return.stories.available`, meaning that the digital ID of the comic should never be equal to the number of available stories.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `digitalId` is an identifier for the comic, while `available` is a count of stories associated with that comic. These two values represent different concepts: one is an ID and the other is a quantity. 
2. **Semantic Context**: It is reasonable to expect that an ID (which is a unique identifier) would not equal a count of items (which can vary). However, there is no explicit restriction in the API specification that prevents these two values from being equal. 
3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests a strong likelihood that this invariant holds true in practice. However, the lack of explicit constraints in the API documentation means that it is theoretically possible for the two values to be equal in some cases, especially if the API is updated or if there are edge cases not covered by the current tests.

### Conclusion
While the empirical evidence strongly supports the invariant, the lack of explicit prohibition in the API specification means that we cannot definitively classify this as a true-positive. It is likely that the invariant holds true based on the data collected, but there remains a possibility that future changes or edge cases could invalidate it. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with a high confidence level due to the lack of explicit constraints in the API documentation.

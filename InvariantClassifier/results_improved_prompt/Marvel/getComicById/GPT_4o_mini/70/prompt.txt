Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}"
  get:
    summary: Fetches a single comic by id.
    description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.

    responses:
      '200':

                      description: The ID of the digital comic representation of this comic. Will be 0 if the comic is not available digitally.

                          description: The number of total available stories in this list. Will always be greater than or equal to the "returned" value.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.digitalId != return.stories.available

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two long scalars. Prints as x != y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 6115 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.data.results.digitalId=56783; output.data.results.stories.available=2
output.data.results.digitalId=54666; output.data.results.stories.available=2
output.data.results.digitalId=50872; output.data.results.stories.available=2
output.data.results.digitalId=1345; output.data.results.stories.available=2
output.data.results.digitalId=29614; output.data.results.stories.available=2

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `data.results` object contains a `creators` property, which has a `returned` integer indicating the number of creators returned in the collection (up to 20). Additionally, there is a `textObjects` array that contains descriptive text blurbs for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.creators.returned >= size(return.textObjects[])-1`. This means that the number of creators returned must be greater than or equal to the size of the text objects array minus one.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `returned` field indicates how many creators are associated with the comic, while `textObjects` contains descriptive texts. The invariant suggests a relationship between the number of creators and the number of text objects.
2. **Logical Consistency**: The invariant implies that for every text object, there should be at least one creator, and if there are no text objects, there can be zero creators. However, the relationship is not inherently logical because the number of creators does not necessarily correlate with the number of text objects. There could be cases where a comic has many text objects but few or no creators, or vice versa.
3. **Empirical Evidence**: The testing conducted (100 calls with no counterexamples and 96 examples with 63 distinct examples) suggests that the invariant holds true for the tested cases. However, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant is universally valid, especially given the logical inconsistency noted above.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant suggests a correlation that does not necessarily hold true based on the semantics of the variables involved, it is likely a false-positive. The relationship between the number of creators and text objects is not guaranteed by the API's design, and there could be valid responses that contradict the invariant. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with a confidence of **0.85** due to the empirical evidence but tempered by the logical inconsistency observed.

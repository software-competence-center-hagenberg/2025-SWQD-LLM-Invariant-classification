### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET request to fetch a comic resource by its ID. The response includes a property called `copyright`, which is a string that contains the copyright notice for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `copyright` field in the response will always equal "© 2022 MARVEL".

### Analysis
1. **Distinct Values**: The invariant claims that the `copyright` field can only take on the value "© 2022 MARVEL". However, the example provided shows that the actual value returned can be represented as `Â© 2022 MARVEL`, which suggests that there may be encoding issues or variations in how the copyright notice is represented.
2. **Counterexamples**: Although 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the presence of a distinct example (`Â© 2022 MARVEL`) indicates that the invariant does not hold universally. The invariant is too restrictive given that there is at least one known variation.
3. **Specification**: The specification does not explicitly limit the `copyright` field to a single value. It only describes it as a string, which can potentially hold multiple values.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the `copyright` field to a single value while the actual data shows variations, this invariant is a **false-positive**. The presence of a distinct example that does not match the invariant confirms that it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the data returned includes a list of comics, each with associated text objects and key dates. The invariant in question compares the sizes of two arrays: `textObjects` and `dates`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array minus one is less than or equal to the size of the `dates` array minus one. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

size(return.textObjects) - 1 <= size(return.dates) - 1

This simplifies to:

size(return.textObjects) <= size(return.dates)

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that for every comic fetched, the number of text objects associated with it should not exceed the number of key dates. Given that the API has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, it indicates a strong correlation between the number of text objects and dates returned. However, the invariant does not have explicit support in the API specification. The specification does not state that there is a required relationship between the number of text objects and dates, meaning that there could be comics with varying numbers of text objects and dates.

### Conclusion
While the invariant holds true for the tested cases, the lack of explicit specification support for this relationship means that it cannot be definitively classified as a true-positive. There could be edge cases or specific comics that do not adhere to this invariant. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with a confidence of **0.85** due to the strong testing results but the absence of specification backing.

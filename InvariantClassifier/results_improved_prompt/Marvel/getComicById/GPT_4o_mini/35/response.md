### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each element in the `results` array contains an `images` array, which in turn contains objects with properties `path` and `extension`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that all elements in the `return.images[]` (which refers to the `images` array within the `results` array) are not null. This is represented as `return.images[] elements != null`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant asserts that every image object in the `images` array must be non-null. This means that if the `images` array is present, it should not contain any null entries.
2. **Swagger Definition Context**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that the `images` array cannot contain null values. It simply describes the structure of the response. However, it does not provide any information that would suggest null values are permissible either.
3. **Testing Evidence**: The invariant has been tested against 10,000 calls to the API, and no counterexamples have been found. This suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true for the current implementation of the API.
4. **Semantic Consideration**: In the context of the API, it is reasonable to expect that if an image is referenced, it should not be null, as null images would not provide any useful information to the client.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of counterexamples in extensive testing and the reasonable expectation that image entries should not be null, the invariant can be classified as a true-positive. However, it is important to note that this classification is based on the current implementation and the provided Swagger definition, which does not contradict the invariant. 

**Verdict**: true-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

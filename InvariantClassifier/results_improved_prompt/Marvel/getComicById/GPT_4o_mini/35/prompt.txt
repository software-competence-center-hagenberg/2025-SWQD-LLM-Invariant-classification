Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.images[] elements != null

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.sequence.EltNonZero
Invariant description: Represents the invariant "x != 0" where x represents all of the elements of a sequence of long. Prints as x[] elements != 0.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that fetches comic resources. The response includes a `data` object containing a `results` array, which has two properties of interest: `prices` and `images`. Each of these properties is an array, where `prices` contains price objects and `images` contains image objects.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `prices` array minus one is less than or equal to the size of the `images` array. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:  
`size(return.prices) - 1 <= size(return.images)`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that for every comic fetched, the number of prices (minus one) should not exceed the number of images associated with that comic. This implies a relationship between the two arrays.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested against 1000 calls without finding a counterexample, and there are 1588 examples in the request data, with 944 distinct examples. This suggests a strong correlation between the number of prices and images returned in the API response.
3. **Logical Consideration**: The invariant logically makes sense in the context of comic resources. It is reasonable to assume that if a comic has multiple prices (e.g., print and digital), it should also have at least one promotional image. However, there is no explicit specification in the Swagger definition that guarantees this relationship.
4. **Potential for Counterexamples**: While the current data supports the invariant, the lack of explicit constraints in the API specification means that it is still possible for a comic to have multiple prices and no images, or vice versa. For example, a comic could theoretically have a price listed but no promotional images available, which would violate the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the empirical evidence supporting the invariant and the logical reasoning behind it, it seems likely that the invariant holds true for the majority of cases. However, due to the absence of explicit constraints in the API specification that guarantee this relationship, there remains a possibility of counterexamples. Therefore, while the invariant is strongly supported by the data, it cannot be classified as a definitive true-positive without further specification.

**Verdict**: false-positive  
**Confidence**: 0.85

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that it returns a `data` object containing a `results` array, which includes a `characters` object. This `characters` object has two properties: `available` and `returned`, both of which are integers. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.characters.available >= return.characters.returned`. This means that the number of available characters should always be greater than or equal to the number of characters returned in the response. 

### Analysis
The invariant is supported by the description in the schema, which states that `available` will always be greater than or equal to `returned`. Additionally, the fact that there have been 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample strongly supports the validity of this invariant. The examples provided also consistently show that `available` is greater than or equal to `returned`. 

### Conclusion
Given the explicit description in the API documentation that `available` will always be greater than or equal to `returned`, along with the empirical evidence from the calls made, this invariant can be classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the lack of counterexamples and the clear support from the API specification.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `data.results` object contains a `digitalId` and a list of `variants`. The `digitalId` can be an integer that is 0 if the comic is not available digitally, and the `variants` is an array that can contain multiple variant issues for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.digitalId >= size(return.variants[])-1`. This means that the digital ID of the comic should be greater than or equal to the size of the variants array minus one.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that if there are variants available for a comic, the `digitalId` should be at least equal to the number of variants minus one. This implies that if there are no variants (size of variants array is 0), then `digitalId` should be at least -1, which is trivially true since `digitalId` is non-negative.

2. **Counterexamples**: The invariant could potentially fail if a comic has a `digitalId` of 0 and has one or more variants. For example, if `digitalId` is 0 and there is one variant, the size of the variants array is 1, and the invariant would require `0 >= 1 - 1`, which is true. However, if there are multiple variants, the invariant could be violated. 

3. **Examples Provided**: The examples provided show that when `digitalId` is 0, there are still variants present. This suggests that the invariant might not hold in cases where `digitalId` is 0 and there are multiple variants. 

4. **General Case**: The invariant seems to restrict the `digitalId` based on the number of variants, which is not necessarily supported by the API's specification. The specification does not imply that `digitalId` should be related to the number of variants in this way. 

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, especially in cases where `digitalId` is 0 and there are multiple variants. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. 

**Confidence**: 0.85 (high confidence due to the logical reasoning and examples provided).

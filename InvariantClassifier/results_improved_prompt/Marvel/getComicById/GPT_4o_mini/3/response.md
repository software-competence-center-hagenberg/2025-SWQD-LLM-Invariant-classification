### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which in turn contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `textObjects` array, where each object has a `type` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `type` property of the `textObjects` array can only take on one of three specific values: "70th_winner_desc", "issue_preview_text", or "issue_solicit_text".

### Analysis
- The invariant is based on the observed values from 508 examples, which include only three distinct values for the `type` property. 
- The fact that no counterexamples were found in 500 calls strengthens the argument that the invariant may hold true.
- However, the invariant's correctness ultimately depends on the API's specification. If the API documentation or implementation allows for other values for the `type` property that are not mentioned in the examples, then the invariant would be a false-positive.
- The invariant does not contradict the specification as it does not explicitly state that the `type` can take on values outside of the provided examples. However, without explicit confirmation from the API documentation that these are the only possible values, there remains a risk that other values could exist.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of counterexamples and the limited number of distinct values observed, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. However, there is a slight uncertainty due to the potential for other values not covered in the examples. Therefore, I assign a confidence level of 0.85 to this classification.

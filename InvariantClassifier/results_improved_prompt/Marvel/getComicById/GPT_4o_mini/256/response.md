### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided swagger definition describes an endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `resourceURI` is a string that represents the path to an individual event resource. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `resourceURI` string is always 46 characters. This is a specific fixed-length requirement for the string variable. 

### Analysis
1. **Fixed Length**: The invariant claims that all `resourceURI` values have a fixed length of 46 characters. However, the examples provided show that the `resourceURI` values are URLs that include a base path and a numeric identifier (e.g., `http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/events/309`). The length of these URLs can vary depending on the numeric identifier at the end. 

2. **Examples Provided**: The examples given (e.g., `http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/events/309`) suggest that the length of the `resourceURI` can change based on the event ID. For instance, if the event ID were to change to a larger number (e.g., `http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/events/12345`), the length of the URL would exceed 46 characters. 

3. **Counterexamples**: Although 500 calls were made without finding a counterexample, this does not guarantee that the invariant is universally true. It is possible that the current set of events being fetched all happen to have IDs that result in a length of 46, but this does not account for future events or IDs that could lead to different lengths. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the length of the `resourceURI` to a specific value, and considering the nature of URLs where the length can vary based on the identifier, it is likely that this invariant is a false-positive. The specification does not support the claim that all `resourceURI` values will always have a fixed length of 46 characters. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** with high confidence due to the variability of the event IDs affecting the length of the URLs.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `data.results` object contains properties such as `stories` and `textObjects`. The `stories` object has an `available` property, which is an integer representing the total number of available stories. The `textObjects` property is an array of objects that provide descriptive text about the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the number of available stories (`return.stories.available`) must be greater than or equal to the size of the `textObjects` array minus one (`size(return.textObjects[]) - 1`). This can be expressed as:

`return.stories.available >= size(return.textObjects[]) - 1`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The invariant compares the number of available stories to the number of text objects. The `available` count represents how many stories are available, while the `textObjects` array contains descriptive texts related to the comic. 
2. **Logical Implication**: The invariant implies that for every comic, the number of available stories should be at least one less than the number of descriptive text objects. This is a specific relationship that may not logically hold in all cases. For example, it is possible to have a comic with multiple text objects but fewer stories available, especially if the text objects are not directly tied to the stories.
3. **Testing and Examples**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls and has not produced any counterexamples. However, the absence of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant is universally true, especially if the relationship between the two variables is not inherently logical.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant suggests a specific relationship that may not be semantically valid (i.e., the number of stories does not necessarily correlate with the number of text objects), and considering that the API documentation does not explicitly support this relationship, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is moderate, as the lack of counterexamples is notable, but the logical relationship itself is questionable.

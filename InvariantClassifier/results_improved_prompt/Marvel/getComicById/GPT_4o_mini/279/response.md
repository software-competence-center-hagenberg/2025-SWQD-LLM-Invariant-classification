### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array contains two properties of interest: `textObjects` (an array of descriptive text blurbs) and `prices` (an array of prices for the comic).  

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array minus one is less than or equal to the size of the `prices` array, represented as:  
`size(return.textObjects[]) - 1 <= size(return.prices[])`  
This means that for every response, the number of text objects should not exceed the number of prices by more than one.  

### Analysis
- The invariant has been tested against 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which strongly suggests that it holds true for the API's current implementation.  
- The invariant logically implies that for every comic, there can be at most one more text description than there are prices. This could be a reasonable assumption if each comic typically has a price and possibly one additional descriptive text.  
- The examples provided show a consistent pattern where the number of text objects is either equal to or one more than the number of prices.  
- However, the invariant does not explicitly contradict any part of the Swagger definition, which does not specify a maximum or minimum relationship between the number of text objects and prices.  

### Conclusion
Given the strong empirical evidence from testing (10,000 calls with no counterexamples) and the logical reasoning based on the API's structure, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The invariant seems to hold true under the current implementation of the API, and there is no indication from the Swagger definition that it would not hold in future implementations. 

**Verdict:** true-positive  
**Confidence:** 0.95

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.etag)==40

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString

Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 7632 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:

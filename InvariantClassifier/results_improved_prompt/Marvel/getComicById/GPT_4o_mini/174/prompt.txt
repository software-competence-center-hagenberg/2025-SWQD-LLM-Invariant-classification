Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}"
  get:
    summary: Fetches a single comic by id.
    description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
    parameters:
      - name: comicId
        in: path
        description: A single comic.
        required: true
        type: integer
        format: int32
    responses:
      '200':
        description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            code:
              type: integer
              description: The HTTP status code of the returned result.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.comicId > return.code

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 150 examples in the requests data, with 100 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.comicId=68243; output.code=200
input.comicId=41114; output.code=200
input.comicId=17998; output.code=200
input.comicId=12227; output.code=200
input.comicId=24268; output.code=200

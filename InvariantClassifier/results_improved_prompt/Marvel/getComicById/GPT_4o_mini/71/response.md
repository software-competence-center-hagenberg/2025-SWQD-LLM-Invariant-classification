### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `data.results` object contains two properties of interest: `digitalId`, which is an integer representing the ID of the digital comic, and `events.available`, which is also an integer representing the number of available events associated with the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant in question states that `return.digitalId >= return.events.available`. This means that for every valid response from the API, the digital ID of the comic should be greater than or equal to the number of available events.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: 
   - `digitalId`: This is an integer that represents the ID of the digital comic. It can be any non-negative integer, including 0.
   - `events.available`: This integer represents the number of available events. According to the description, this value will always be greater than or equal to the "returned" value, which implies it can also be 0.

2. **Evaluating the Invariant**: 
   - The invariant suggests that the digital ID should always be greater than or equal to the number of available events. Given that `events.available` can be 0, the invariant holds true in those cases since any non-negative integer (including `digitalId`) is greater than or equal to 0.
   - The invariant has been tested with 500 calls and no counterexamples were found, which strengthens the case for it being a true-positive.
   - The examples provided show that `digitalId` is consistently greater than or equal to `events.available`, specifically when `events.available` is 0.

3. **Consideration of Edge Cases**: 
   - The only edge case to consider is when `events.available` is greater than 0. However, the invariant does not provide evidence that `digitalId` would be less than `events.available` in any of the tested cases.
   - The invariant does not contradict the API specification, as there is no indication that `digitalId` can be less than `events.available` based on the provided data.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant `return.digitalId >= return.events.available` appears to hold true based on the provided examples and the lack of counterexamples in the testing. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive** with high confidence.

**Verdict**: true-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

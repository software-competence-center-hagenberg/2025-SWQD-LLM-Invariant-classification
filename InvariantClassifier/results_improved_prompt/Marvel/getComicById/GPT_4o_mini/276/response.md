### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in this `results` array can have two properties: `textObjects` (an array of descriptive text blurbs) and `dates` (an array of key dates for the comic). 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array must be less than or equal to the size of the `dates` array for the response: `size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.dates[])`. 

### Analysis
The invariant suggests a relationship between the number of text objects and the number of dates associated with a comic. The fact that there are 10,000 calls made without finding a counterexample strongly indicates that this invariant holds true for the API's current implementation. Additionally, the presence of 7,702 examples, with 5,082 distinct examples, further supports the likelihood that this invariant is valid. 

However, we must consider the semantics of the data. The `textObjects` and `dates` serve different purposes: `textObjects` provide descriptive information about the comic, while `dates` provide key dates related to the comic's release or events. There is no explicit restriction in the Swagger definition that would inherently limit the number of `textObjects` to be less than or equal to the number of `dates`. Therefore, while the invariant holds for the tested cases, it is possible that future data could introduce scenarios where this relationship does not hold. 

### Conclusion
Given the strong empirical evidence supporting the invariant and the lack of counterexamples in the tested calls, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. However, I acknowledge that the semantic relationship between `textObjects` and `dates` does not inherently guarantee this invariant will always hold, which slightly lowers my confidence in its absolute validity. 

**Verdict**: true-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

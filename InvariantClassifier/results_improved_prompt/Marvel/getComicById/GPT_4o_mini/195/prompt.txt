Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}"
  get:
    summary: Fetches a single comic by id.
    description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':

                      properties:
                        extension:
                          type: string
                          description: The file extension for the image.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.thumbnail.extension)==3

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 2 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 2 example values of the variables:
output.data.results.thumbnail.extension=png
output.data.results.thumbnail.extension=jpg

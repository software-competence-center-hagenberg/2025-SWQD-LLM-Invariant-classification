### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an API endpoint that fetches a comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `thumbnail.extension` is a string that represents the file extension for the image associated with the comic. The possible values for this field are likely to be common image file extensions.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `thumbnail.extension` string is always equal to 3, which implies that all valid file extensions returned by this API must be exactly three characters long.

### Analysis
1. **Common Image Extensions**: The examples provided (`png`, `jpg`) both have a length of 3, which supports the invariant. However, there are other common image file extensions such as `jpeg` (4 characters), `gif` (3 characters), and `bmp` (3 characters). The invariant does not account for the possibility of other valid extensions that may not conform to the length of 3.
2. **Counter Examples**: Although 10,000 calls were made without finding a counter example, the existence of other common image formats that could be used in the API response suggests that the invariant may not hold universally. The fact that only 2 distinct examples were found in the requests data raises concerns about the completeness of the testing.
3. **Specification Clarity**: The specification does not explicitly restrict the `thumbnail.extension` to only 3-character strings, which indicates that there could be valid cases where the length is different.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the length of the `thumbnail.extension` to exactly 3 characters without clear support from the specification and considering the potential existence of other valid extensions, this invariant is likely a false-positive. The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, especially since there are known image formats that do not conform to this length restriction. 

Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with high confidence due to the reasoning provided.

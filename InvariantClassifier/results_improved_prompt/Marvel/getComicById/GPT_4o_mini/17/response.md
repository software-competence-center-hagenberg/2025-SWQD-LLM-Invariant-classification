### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which in turn contains a `results` array. Within each item of the `results` array, there is a `textObjects` array that is described as a set of descriptive text blurbs for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.textObjects != null`, which implies that the `textObjects` array should not be null in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant asserts that the `textObjects` field will always be present and not null in the response. Given that the API is designed to return comic resources, it is reasonable to expect that there will be some descriptive text associated with each comic.
2. **Testing Evidence**: The fact that 10,000 calls have been made without encountering a counterexample strongly suggests that the invariant holds true for the current implementation of the API. This level of testing provides a high degree of confidence in the validity of the invariant.
3. **Specification Considerations**: The swagger definition does not explicitly state that `textObjects` can be null or omitted, which further supports the assertion that it should always be present.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant `return.textObjects != null` is classified as a **true-positive**. The extensive testing and the lack of counterexamples, combined with the absence of contradictory information in the swagger definition, lead to a high confidence in this classification.

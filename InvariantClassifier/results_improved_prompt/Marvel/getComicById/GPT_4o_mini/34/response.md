### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which in turn contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array has an `images` property, which is itself an array of objects representing promotional images associated with the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.images != null`, which implies that the `images` property should not be null for the response returned by the API.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant is checking if the `images` property is not null. Given that the `images` property is an array, it is important to note that an empty array (`[]`) is not null, but it may not contain any elements.
2. **Swagger Definition Context**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that the `images` array will always contain elements. It only describes the structure of the response. Therefore, it is possible for the `images` array to be empty, which would mean that `images` is not null but could still be an empty array.
3. **Testing and Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample. However, this does not guarantee that the invariant is universally true, especially if the API can return comics that do not have promotional images.

### Conclusion
While the invariant `return.images != null` may hold true for the tested cases, it does not account for the possibility of the `images` array being empty. Since the Swagger definition does not guarantee that `images` will always contain elements, the invariant is likely a false-positive. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** with a confidence of 0.85 due to the lack of explicit guarantees in the API documentation regarding the presence of images.

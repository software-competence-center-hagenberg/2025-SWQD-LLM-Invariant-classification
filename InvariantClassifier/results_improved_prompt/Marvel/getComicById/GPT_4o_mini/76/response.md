### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `results` array contains objects with a `digitalId` and a `dates` array. The `digitalId` is an integer that can be `0` if the comic is not available digitally. The `dates` array contains objects with `date` and `type` properties.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.digitalId != size(return.dates[])`, meaning that the `digitalId` should not be equal to the number of date entries in the `dates` array.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `digitalId` is an integer, while `size(return.dates[])` returns the count of date objects in the `dates` array. The invariant asserts that these two values should never be equal.
2. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples have been found, which suggests that the invariant holds under the tested conditions. However, the invariant's correctness depends on the underlying logic of how `digitalId` and `dates` are populated.
3. **Possible Values**: The `digitalId` can be `0`, and the `dates` array can have varying lengths. If `digitalId` is `0`, the invariant would hold if the `dates` array is not empty. If `digitalId` is greater than `0`, the invariant could potentially fail if the number of dates matches the `digitalId`.
4. **Specification Considerations**: The specification does not explicitly state that `digitalId` and the size of `dates` are related, but it does allow for the possibility that they could be equal in some cases, especially if there are comics with a non-zero `digitalId` and a corresponding number of dates.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant has been tested extensively without counterexamples, it is likely that it holds for the majority of cases. However, the potential for `digitalId` to equal the size of `dates` in certain scenarios (especially if the API behavior changes or if there are edge cases not covered in the tests) suggests that the invariant may not hold universally. Therefore, while the evidence leans towards it being a true-positive, there remains a risk of it being a false-positive due to the lack of explicit constraints in the specification regarding the relationship between `digitalId` and `dates`. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.75

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `data.results` object contains an `events` object with an `available` integer field, which represents the total number of available events. Additionally, there is a `textObjects` array that contains descriptive text blurbs for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the number of available events (`return.events.available`) must be less than or equal to the size of the `textObjects` array (`size(return.textObjects[])`). This can be expressed as:

`return.events.available <= size(return.textObjects[])`

### Analysis
- The invariant suggests that the number of available events should not exceed the number of text objects associated with the comic. 
- The provided examples show that when `events.available` is 0, the `textObjects` array contains at least one object, which satisfies the invariant.
- The invariant has been tested with 50 calls, and no counterexamples were found, which strengthens the argument for its validity. 
- However, the invariant's correctness hinges on the relationship between events and text objects, which is not explicitly defined in the API documentation. It is possible that there could be cases where there are available events but no corresponding text objects, especially if the API allows for comics with events that do not have descriptive text.

### Conclusion
While the invariant holds true for the tested examples, the lack of explicit constraints in the API documentation regarding the relationship between `events.available` and `textObjects` raises concerns about its universal applicability. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** due to the potential for edge cases that could violate the invariant. 

**Verdict:** false-positive
**Confidence:** 0.8

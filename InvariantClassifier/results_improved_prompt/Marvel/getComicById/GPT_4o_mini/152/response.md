### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have a `collectedIssues` array and an `images` array.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `collectedIssues` array minus one is less than or equal to the size of the `images` array minus one, expressed as:

`size(return.collectedIssues[]) - 1 <= size(return.images[]) - 1`

This can be simplified to:

`size(return.collectedIssues[]) <= size(return.images[])`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The invariant compares the number of collected issues to the number of images associated with a comic. The invariant suggests that for every comic fetched, the number of collected issues should not exceed the number of images.
2. **Semantic Context**: The description of `collectedIssues` states that it will generally be empty for periodical formats such as "comic" or "magazine". This implies that there may be cases where `collectedIssues` is zero. The `images` array, on the other hand, could potentially contain promotional images even if there are no collected issues.
3. **Counterexamples**: The invariant could potentially fail in cases where a comic has no collected issues (i.e., `size(collectedIssues) = 0`) but has one or more images (i.e., `size(images) >= 1`). In such cases, the invariant holds true. However, if there are comics that have a non-empty `collectedIssues` array but no images, the invariant would not hold. 
4. **Testing**: The fact that 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample suggests that the invariant holds in the tested cases, but it does not guarantee that it holds universally. The absence of counterexamples does not rule out the possibility of edge cases or other scenarios that could invalidate the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic context of the variables and the potential for comics to have a non-empty `collectedIssues` array while having no images, the invariant is likely a **false-positive**. The invariant restricts the relationship between two variables in a way that is not guaranteed by the API's specification. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with a confidence of 0.85 due to the lack of counterexamples in the tested calls but acknowledging the potential for edge cases.

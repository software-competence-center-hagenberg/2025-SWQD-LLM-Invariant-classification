### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches comic resources by their ID. The response includes a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array has two properties of interest: `textObjects` and `prices`, both of which are arrays. 

### Invariant
The invariant in question states that the size of the `textObjects` array minus one is less than or equal to the size of the `prices` array minus one. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:  
`size(return.textObjects) - 1 <= size(return.prices) - 1`  
This simplifies to:  
`size(return.textObjects) <= size(return.prices)`  

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that for every comic resource fetched, the number of text objects should be less than or equal to the number of prices. Given that the API has been tested with 100 calls and no counterexamples were found, this indicates a strong correlation between the two arrays in the response. However, the invariant does not consider the possibility of comics that may not have any prices or text objects. 

The specification does not explicitly state that every comic must have at least one price or one text object. Therefore, it is possible that there could be cases where a comic has text objects but no prices, or vice versa. This would violate the invariant. 

### Conclusion
While the invariant holds true for the tested examples, the lack of explicit constraints in the API specification means that it is not guaranteed to hold for all possible responses. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. 

**Confidence**: 0.85 - I am fairly confident in this classification due to the lack of explicit constraints in the API specification, despite the strong correlation observed in the tested examples.

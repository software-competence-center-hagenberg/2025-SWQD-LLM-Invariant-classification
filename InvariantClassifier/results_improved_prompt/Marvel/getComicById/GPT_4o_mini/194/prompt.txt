Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}"
  get:
    summary: Fetches a single comic by id.
    description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':

                        path:

                          description: The directory path of to the image.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.thumbnail.path is Url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsUrl
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable is always a URL. Represented as x is Url.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 7356 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.data.results.thumbnail.path=http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/6/90/5669af1526de0
output.data.results.thumbnail.path=http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/3/e0/5d388096ac446

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that fetches a comic resource by its ID. The response includes two string properties: `copyright` and `attributionText`. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.copyright` is a substring of `return.attributionText`. This means that the value of the `copyright` field should always appear within the value of the `attributionText` field in the API response.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `copyright` field typically contains a copyright notice, while the `attributionText` field is meant for attribution notices. These fields serve different purposes and are not inherently related. 
2. **Example Values**: The provided example shows `output.copyright=© 2022 MARVEL` and `output.attributionText=Data provided by Marvel. © 2022 MARVEL`. In this case, the copyright notice does appear at the end of the attribution text, which supports the invariant for this specific example. However, this does not guarantee that it will hold for all possible values.
3. **Counterexamples**: The fact that no counterexamples were found in 10,000 calls suggests that the invariant may hold for the tested cases. However, it does not conclusively prove that it holds universally, especially given the semantic mismatch between the two fields.
4. **Specification Considerations**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `copyright` must be a substring of `attributionText`, which raises the possibility that there could be valid responses where this invariant does not hold.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic difference between the two fields and the lack of explicit specification supporting the invariant, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a **false-positive**. While it may hold for the tested cases, it is not guaranteed to hold universally across all valid API responses. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to fetch a comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `data` object, which contains a `limit` property of type integer. However, the definition does not specify what values this `limit` can take, nor does it indicate that it is restricted to a specific value.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.data.limit == 20`. This suggests that the `limit` property in the response will always be equal to 20.

### Analysis
- The invariant claims that the `limit` will always be 20. While it is noted that there have been 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, this does not necessarily mean that the limit can only be 20. The API specification does not explicitly restrict the `limit` to only this value. 
- The fact that there is only one distinct example of the `limit` being 20 in the 11,650 examples suggests that it is a common value, but it does not confirm that it is the only possible value. 
- The absence of counterexamples in the tested calls could be due to the specific nature of the test cases or the data available at the time of testing, rather than a definitive restriction imposed by the API.

### Conclusion
Given that the API specification does not explicitly restrict the `limit` to only the value of 20, and that there is no indication that this is the only valid response, the invariant is likely a false-positive. The invariant is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API, as other values for `limit` could potentially exist. 

Therefore, the verdict is **false-positive** with a confidence of **0.85** due to the lack of explicit restrictions in the API documentation.

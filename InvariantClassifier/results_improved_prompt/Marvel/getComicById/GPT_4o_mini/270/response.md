### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in this array can have properties `stories` and `events`, both of which contain an `available` integer that indicates the number of available stories and events, respectively.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.stories.available > return.events.available`, meaning that the number of available stories should always be greater than the number of available events in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Data from Calls**: The invariant has been tested against 1000 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests that the invariant holds true for those cases. Additionally, there are 1500 examples in the request data, with 26 distinct examples, indicating a reasonable amount of data supporting the invariant.
2. **Example Values**: The provided example values show that in all cases, the `stories.available` is greater than `events.available`, specifically with `events.available` being 0 in all examples. This pattern may suggest a consistent relationship between the two fields.
3. **Specification Considerations**: The specification does not explicitly state that `stories.available` must always be greater than `events.available`. It only mentions that `available` values will be greater than or equal to the `returned` values. This means there could be scenarios where both `stories.available` and `events.available` could be equal or even where `events.available` could exceed `stories.available`, depending on the underlying data.

### Conclusion
While the invariant has not been contradicted by the data collected so far, the lack of explicit specification support and the potential for future data to contradict the invariant leads to the conclusion that it is likely a **false-positive**. The invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold true for every valid request on the API, as the specification does not enforce this relationship. 

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** with a confidence of 0.85 due to the strong evidence from the current data but acknowledging the possibility of exceptions in future data.

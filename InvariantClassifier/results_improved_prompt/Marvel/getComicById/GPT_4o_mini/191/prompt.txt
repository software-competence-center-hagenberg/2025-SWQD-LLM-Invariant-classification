Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}"
  get:
    summary: Fetches a single comic by id.
    description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.ean)==20

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 1000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 1650 examples in the requests data, with 73 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.data.results.ean=9780785 119586 51399
output.data.results.ean=9781302 920906 51599
output.data.results.ean=9781302 910044 53999

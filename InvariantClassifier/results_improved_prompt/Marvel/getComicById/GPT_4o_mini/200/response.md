### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in this array has properties `title` and `variantDescription`, both of which are strings.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.variantDescription` is a substring of `return.title`. This means that for every comic fetched, the variant description should be part of the title string.

### Analysis
1. **Contextual Relevance**: The `title` of a comic typically represents the main name of the comic, while the `variantDescription` provides additional information about the specific variant of that comic. It is reasonable to expect that variant descriptions could sometimes be included in the title, especially for variants that are well-known or have specific names (e.g., "GARNER VARIANT"). However, it is also common for titles to be distinct from their variant descriptions, especially when the variant is not a part of the title.

2. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 1000 calls and no counterexamples were found. However, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant holds universally. The examples provided show cases where the `variantDescription` is empty or does not appear to be a substring of the `title`. For instance, in the example with the title "Annihilators (2010) #1 (GARNER VARIANT)", the `variantDescription` is "GARNER VARIANT", which is indeed a substring of the title. But for other titles with empty variant descriptions, the invariant fails.

3. **Specification Clarity**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `variantDescription` must always be a substring of `title`. This suggests that there could be cases where the variant description is completely unrelated to the title, especially if the variant is not a well-known or named variant.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, while the invariant holds in many tested cases, it does not universally apply to all possible responses from the API. The lack of counterexamples in the tested calls does not sufficiently support the claim that this invariant is a true-positive. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive**. 

**Confidence**: 0.85

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/v1/public/comics/{comicId}` is designed to fetch a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the `data.results` object contains properties such as `pageCount` (an integer representing the number of story pages in the comic) and `dates` (an array of objects representing key dates for the comic). The invariant in question compares `pageCount` with the size of the `dates` array minus one.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.pageCount != size(return.dates[])-1`. This means that the number of pages in the comic should not equal the number of key dates minus one.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `pageCount` represents the total number of pages in the comic, while `dates` represents key dates associated with the comic. The invariant suggests a relationship between these two variables that is not inherently logical. The number of pages in a comic does not have a direct correlation with the number of key dates it has.
2. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 500 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests that it may hold true for the tested cases. However, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that it will hold true for all possible cases. 
3. **Specification Review**: The specification does not provide any explicit relationship between `pageCount` and the `dates` array. Since the invariant imposes a restriction that is not supported by the API's design or documentation, it raises concerns about its validity.
4. **Semantic Consideration**: Comparing `pageCount` with the size of `dates` minus one lacks semantic meaning. The number of pages in a comic and the number of key dates are independent attributes, and there is no logical reason to expect them to have a specific relationship.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of a logical connection between `pageCount` and the size of `dates`, and the fact that the invariant imposes a restriction that is not supported by the API specification, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the semantic mismatch and the lack of explicit support in the API documentation.

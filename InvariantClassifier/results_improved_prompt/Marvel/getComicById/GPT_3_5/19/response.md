## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a 'get' operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which in turn contains an 'urls' array.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.urls != null', which means that the 'urls' array in the response body should not be null.

## Analysis
Based on the provided swagger definition and the invariant, it is highly likely that the 'urls' array in the response body will not be null. The structure of the response body suggests that the 'urls' array will always be present as part of the 'results' array.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.95

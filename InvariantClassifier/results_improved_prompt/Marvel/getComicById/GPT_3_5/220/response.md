## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which in turn contains an 'events' object with an 'items' array.
- Each 'items' object in the 'events' array has a 'resourceURI' and a 'name' property.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.events.items[] elements != null', which means that all elements in the 'items' array under 'events' should not be null.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the description of the 'items' array, it is reasonable to expect that all elements in the 'items' array should not be null. The description of the 'items' array does not indicate that null values are allowed, and it makes sense that each item should have a 'resourceURI' and a 'name'.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a true-positive with high confidence, as it aligns with the expected structure of the response and has been validated with a large number of API calls.

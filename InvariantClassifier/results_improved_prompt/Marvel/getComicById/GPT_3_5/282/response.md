## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which includes 'collectedIssues' and 'dates' arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.collectedIssues[]) % size(return.dates[])-1 == 0
This invariant checks if the size of the 'collectedIssues' array is divisible by the size of the 'dates' array minus 1.

## Analysis
The invariant is checking a relationship between the sizes of two arrays in the response. It is likely that the 'collectedIssues' and 'dates' arrays have a specific relationship, and the invariant has been validated with 10000 calls, with 341 examples found and 228 distinct examples.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

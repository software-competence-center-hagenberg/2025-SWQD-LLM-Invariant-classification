## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint fetches a single comic by ID and returns a response containing text objects and collected issues.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the 'textObjects' array in the response should be greater than or equal to the size of the 'collectedIssues' array.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the nature of the response, it is reasonable to expect that the 'textObjects' array would generally be larger or equal in size to the 'collectedIssues' array. This is because 'textObjects' are descriptive text blurbs for the comic, and there could be multiple text blurbs for a single comic, whereas 'collectedIssues' is a list of issues collected in the comic, which may generally be smaller.

## Conclusion
Given the nature of the response and the absence of counterexamples after 100 calls, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive.

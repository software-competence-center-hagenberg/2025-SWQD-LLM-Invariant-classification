## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response contains a list of key dates for the comic.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.comicId > size(return.dates[])
This means that the comicId provided in the request should be greater than the number of dates returned in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all the tested cases. The input comicId is always greater than the number of dates returned in the response. The examples cover a wide range of comicIds and corresponding dates, and in each case, the invariant holds.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the wide range of examples, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The invariant holds for all tested cases, and there are no counterexamples found in the 10000 calls made to the API. Therefore, the verdict is true-positive with high confidence.

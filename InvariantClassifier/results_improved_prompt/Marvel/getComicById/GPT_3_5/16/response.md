## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a 'get' operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'variantDescription' field of type string, which represents a text description of the variant if the issue is a variant.

## Invariant
The invariant is "return.variantDescription one of { ""GARNER VARIANT"", ""WHITE VARIANT"" }". This means that the 'variantDescription' field in the response should be either "GARNER VARIANT" or "WHITE VARIANT".

## Analysis
- We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- We found 50 examples in the requests data, with 3 of them being distinct examples, and all of them had 'variantDescription' values of "WHITE VARIANT", "GARNER VARIANT", or an empty string.
- The specification does not explicitly mention other possible values for 'variantDescription'.
- The invariant is consistent with the semantics of the 'variantDescription' field, as it restricts the possible values to specific variant descriptions.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

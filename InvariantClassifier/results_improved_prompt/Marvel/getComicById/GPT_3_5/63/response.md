## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response contains a list of URLs for the comic resource.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.comicId > size(return.urls[])
This means that the comic ID in the request should be greater than the number of URLs in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 11650 examples, with 7633 distinct examples. The examples show that the comic ID is indeed greater than the number of URLs in the response for each example.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples provided, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The invariant holds for all tested cases, and there is no indication in the API specification that contradicts this invariant.

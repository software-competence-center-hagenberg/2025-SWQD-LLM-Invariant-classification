## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array containing information about the comic, including 'digitalId' and 'collectedIssues'.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.digitalId >= size(return.collectedIssues[])

## Analysis
- The invariant compares the 'digitalId' field with the size of the 'collectedIssues' array in the response.
- The 'digitalId' is expected to be an integer representing the ID of the digital comic representation, and 'collectedIssues' is an array of issues collected in the comic.
- The invariant implies that the 'digitalId' should be greater than or equal to the number of collected issues, which makes sense in the context of digital representation and collected issues.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any other values or conditions for 'digitalId' or 'collectedIssues' that would contradict this invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant seems to be a true-positive. The comparison between 'digitalId' and the size of 'collectedIssues' is semantically meaningful and aligns with the expected behavior of the fields in the response. The extensive testing with 100 calls also supports the likelihood of this invariant being a true-positive.

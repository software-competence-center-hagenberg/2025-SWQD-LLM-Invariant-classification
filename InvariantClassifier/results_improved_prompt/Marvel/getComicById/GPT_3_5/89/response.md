## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a 'get' operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array containing 'pageCount' and 'dates' fields.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.pageCount != size(return.dates[])-1
This invariant checks if the 'pageCount' is not equal to the size of 'dates' array minus 1.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the 'pageCount' and 'dates' fields in the response are unrelated in terms of their values. The 'pageCount' represents the number of story pages in the comic, while the 'dates' array contains key dates for the comic. There is no semantic relationship between these two fields that would justify the invariant.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive
Confidence: 0.9

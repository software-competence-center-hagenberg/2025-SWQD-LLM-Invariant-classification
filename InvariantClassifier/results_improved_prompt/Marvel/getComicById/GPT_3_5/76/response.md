## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array containing 'digitalId' and 'dates' array.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.digitalId != size(return.dates[])
This means that the 'digitalId' should not be equal to the size of the 'dates' array in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the 'digitalId' is always 0, and the 'dates' array contains two elements, which means the size of the 'dates' array is always 2. Therefore, the invariant return.digitalId != size(return.dates[]) holds true for all the examples.

## Conclusion
The invariant return.digitalId != size(return.dates[]) is a true-positive, as it holds for all the examples tested. The confidence is high due to the large number of examples (10000 calls) and the consistency of the results.

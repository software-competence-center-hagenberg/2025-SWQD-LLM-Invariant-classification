## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is for fetching a single comic by ID.
- The response contains a list of characters with the number of total available characters and the list of returned characters.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.characters.available == size(return.characters.items[])
This means that the number of total available characters should be equal to the size of the list of returned characters.

## Analysis
- We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 50 examples in the requests data, with 49 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that for each call, the number of total available characters is equal to the size of the list of returned characters.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples tested.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a true-positive. The examples tested support the invariant, and there are no counterexamples found in the provided data. Therefore, the invariant is likely to hold for every valid request on the API.

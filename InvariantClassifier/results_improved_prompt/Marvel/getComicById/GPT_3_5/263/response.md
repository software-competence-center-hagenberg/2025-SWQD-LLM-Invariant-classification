- The response schema includes the properties 'digitalId' and 'stories', which are both part of the 'results' array.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.digitalId != return.stories.returned
This invariant checks if the 'digitalId' is not equal to the 'returned' value within the 'stories' object.

## Analysis
- The invariant has been tested with 10000 calls on the API, and no counterexamples have been found.
- There are 11500 examples in the requests data, with 6088 distinct examples, indicating a thorough testing of the invariant.
- The examples provided show different values for 'digitalId' and 'returned', supporting the invariant.
- The invariant makes semantic sense as it compares the ID of the digital comic with the number of stories returned.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the semantic relevance of the comparison, the invariant is classified as true-positive.

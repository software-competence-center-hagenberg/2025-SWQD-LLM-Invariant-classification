## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' is a GET request to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a 'data' object, which in turn contains a 'results' array.
- Each item in the 'results' array has a 'characters' field of type object.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.characters != null', which means that the 'characters' field in the response body should not be null.

## Analysis
Based on the swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to expect that the 'characters' field in the response should not be null. The swagger definition does not explicitly mention that the 'characters' field can be null, and the invariant aligns with the structure of the response.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes 'data.results' which contains 'variants' and 'stories' arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.variants[]) % size(return.stories.items[])-1 == 0
This invariant checks if the size of the 'variants' array is divisible by the size of the 'stories' array minus 1.

## Analysis
- The 'variants' and 'stories' arrays are both present in the response schema.
- The invariant does not explicitly contradict the specification.
- The invariant is based on the sizes of the arrays in the response, and the examples provided support the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

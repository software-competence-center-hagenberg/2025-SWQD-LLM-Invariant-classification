## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which in turn contains a 'collectedIssues' array.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.collectedIssues != null', which means that the 'collectedIssues' array in the response body should not be null.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to expect that the 'collectedIssues' array should not be null in the response.
- The description of the 'collectedIssues' field in the swagger definition also suggests that it will generally be empty for certain formats, which implies that it should not be null.
- The fact that 10000 calls were made on the API without finding a single counter example provides strong evidence in favor of the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing, the invariant 'return.collectedIssues != null' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which includes 'textObjects' and 'dates' arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.dates[])
This means that the number of elements in the 'textObjects' array should be less than or equal to the number of elements in the 'dates' array.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the information about the API calls, the invariant seems to hold true for the given endpoint. The 'textObjects' and 'dates' arrays are part of the response body for fetching a single comic, and it is reasonable to expect that the number of descriptive text blurbs for the comic would be less than or equal to the number of key dates for the comic.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

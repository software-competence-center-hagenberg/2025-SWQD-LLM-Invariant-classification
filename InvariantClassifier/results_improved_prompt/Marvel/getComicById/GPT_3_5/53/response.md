## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'dates' array within the 'results' array.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.dates[]) one of { 2, 3, 4}

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the response schema, the 'dates' array within the 'results' array can have a variable number of elements. The invariant states that the size of this array should be either 2, 3, or 4. However, the response schema does not impose any such restriction, and the examples provided also show varying numbers of elements in the 'dates' array.

## Conclusion
The invariant 'size(return.dates[]) one of { 2, 3, 4}' is a false-positive. The response schema and the examples contradict this invariant, indicating that it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

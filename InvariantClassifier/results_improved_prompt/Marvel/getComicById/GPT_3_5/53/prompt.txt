Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: size(return.dates[]) one of { 2, 3, 4 }

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.OneOfScalar
Invariant description: Represents long variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 5759 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.data.results.dates=[{"date":"1991-08-01T00:00:00-0400","type":"onsaleDate"},{"date":"2014-12-16T00:00:00-0500","type":"focDate"},{"date":"2017-01-09T00:00:00-0500","type":"unlimitedDate"}]

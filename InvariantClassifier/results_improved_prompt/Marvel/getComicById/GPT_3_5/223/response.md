## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array containing digitalId and characters.returned fields.

## Invariant
The invariant is that return.digitalId != return.characters.returned, where 'return' refers to the 'data.results' in the response body.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, we have tried 10000 calls on the API and did not find a single counterexample. We found 11600 examples in the requests data, with 6088 of them being distinct examples. The examples provided also demonstrate that the digitalId and characters.returned fields have different values in each example, supporting the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples provided, the invariant return.digitalId != return.characters.returned is likely a true-positive for the given REST API endpoint.

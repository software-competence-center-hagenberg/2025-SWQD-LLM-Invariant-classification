## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes the 'collectedIssues' and 'prices' arrays under 'data.results'.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the size of 'return.collectedIssues[]' minus 1 is not equal to the size of 'return.prices[]'.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, it seems unlikely that the size of 'return.collectedIssues[]' minus 1 would be consistently different from the size of 'return.prices[]'. The 'collectedIssues' and 'prices' arrays are independent and their sizes are not directly related in a way that would make this invariant hold true for every valid request.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a false-positive, as it is unlikely to hold for every valid request on the API. The confidence level is high given the analysis of the Swagger definition and the nature of the invariant.

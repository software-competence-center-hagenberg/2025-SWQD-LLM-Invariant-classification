## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a REST endpoint for fetching a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a field 'stories' with subfields 'available' and 'returned', both of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.stories.available >= return.stories.returned

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- There are 11500 examples in the requests data, with 47 distinct examples.
- The example values of the variables show that 'return.data.results.stories.available' is always greater than or equal to 'return.data.results.stories.returned'.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the values of 'return.data.results.stories.available' and 'return.data.results.stories.returned'.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, it is highly likely that the invariant 'return.stories.available >= return.stories.returned' is a true-positive for the given REST API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a 'get' operation that fetches a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains 'resourceURI' and 'events' objects.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.resourceURI' is a substring of 'return.events.collectionURI'.
- This means that the 'resourceURI' should be a substring of the 'collectionURI'.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 7623 distinct examples.
- The provided examples show that the 'resourceURI' is indeed a substring of the 'collectionURI' for each example.
- The examples are consistent with the invariant and cover a large number of cases.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the format of 'resourceURI' and 'collectionURI' that would contradict the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistency of the examples with the invariant, the invariant 'return.resourceURI' is a substring of 'return.events.collectionURI' is classified as a true-positive.

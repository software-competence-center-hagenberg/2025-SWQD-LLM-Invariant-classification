## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'prices' field, which is an array of objects with 'type' and 'price' properties.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.prices[] elements != null', which means that all elements in the 'prices' array should not be null.

## Analysis
- The response schema does not explicitly allow null values for the 'prices' array.
- The invariant is reasonable for a list of prices, as null prices would not make sense in this context.
- The specification does not contradict the invariant.
- 10000 calls have been made, and no counterexamples have been found.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing, the invariant 'return.prices[] elements != null' is classified as a true-positive.

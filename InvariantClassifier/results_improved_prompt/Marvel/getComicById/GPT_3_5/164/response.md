## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about a REST endpoint that fetches a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a property 'code' of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.code == 200', which means that the response code should always be 200.

## Analysis
Based on the provided information, the response code is expected to be 200 for a successful response. The swagger definition does not mention any other possible values for the 'code' property.

## Conclusion
The invariant 'return.code == 200' is classified as true-positive. The confidence is high given the large number of calls (10000) with no counterexamples, and the fact that the specification does not contradict the invariant.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}"
  get:
    summary: Fetches a single comic by id.
    description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.digitalId >= 0

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.LowerBound
Invariant description: Represents the invariant x >= c, where c is a constant and x is a long scalar.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 6069 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.data.results.digitalId=45325
return.data.results.digitalId=7030
return.data.results.digitalId=45327
return.data.results.digitalId=47983
return.data.results.digitalId=45321

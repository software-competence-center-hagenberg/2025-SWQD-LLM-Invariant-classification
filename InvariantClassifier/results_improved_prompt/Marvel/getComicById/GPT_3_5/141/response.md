## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which includes 'variants' and 'collectedIssues' arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.variants[])-1 >= size(return.collectedIssues[])-1

## Analysis
The invariant compares the sizes of the 'variants' and 'collectedIssues' arrays in the response. It checks if the size of 'variants' array minus 1 is greater than or equal to the size of 'collectedIssues' array minus 1. This means that the number of variants should be greater than or equal to the number of collected issues.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided information and the extensive testing of 100 calls, the invariant is likely a true-positive. The comparison of array sizes is a reasonable check, and the absence of any counterexamples in the testing indicates that the invariant holds for the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about a REST endpoint that fetches a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a field 'ean' under 'data.results', which is a string representing the EAN barcode for the comic.

## Invariant
- The invariant is LENGTH(return.ean)==20, indicating that the length of the 'ean' barcode in the response should always be 20 characters.

## Analysis
- We have tried 1000 calls on the API and did not find a single counterexample to the invariant.
- We found 1650 examples in the requests data, with 73 of them being distinct examples, indicating a good coverage of the data.
- The examples provided also show that the 'ean' values consistently have a length of 20 characters.
- The specification does not explicitly mention other possible lengths for the 'ean' barcode, which supports the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent examples found, the invariant LENGTH(return.ean)==20 is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response body contains a 'textObjects' field within the 'results' array.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.textObjects != null' specifies that the 'textObjects' field in the response body should not be null.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the 10000 calls made to the API, the invariant 'return.textObjects != null' holds true for all the responses. The response schema does not indicate that 'textObjects' can be null, and the extensive testing supports the absence of null 'textObjects' in the responses.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.95

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which includes 'pageCount' and 'events' items.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.pageCount >= size(return.events.items[])-1

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- There are 797 examples in the requests data, with 119 distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that for each response, the 'pageCount' is greater than or equal to the size of 'events.items' minus 1.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples provided.
- The semantics of the variables also make sense in the context of the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, the invariant 'return.pageCount >= size(return.events.items[])-1' is likely a true-positive for the given REST API.

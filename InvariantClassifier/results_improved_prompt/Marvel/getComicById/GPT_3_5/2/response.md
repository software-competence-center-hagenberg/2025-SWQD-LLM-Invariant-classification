## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about a REST endpoint that fetches a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a field 'data' which has a subfield 'results' that contains an array of comics. Each comic has a 'prices' field which is an array of prices.
- The 'price' field is a number representing the price of the comic in USD.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.price >= 0.0', where 'return' refers to the path 'data.results.prices' in the response body.
- This invariant specifies that the price of the comic should be greater than or equal to 0.0.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 17843 examples in the requests data, with 60 of them being distinct examples.
- The example values of the 'price' field in the response body are all positive numbers, indicating that the invariant holds for the observed data.

## Conclusion
Based on the observed data and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant 'return.price >= 0.0' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

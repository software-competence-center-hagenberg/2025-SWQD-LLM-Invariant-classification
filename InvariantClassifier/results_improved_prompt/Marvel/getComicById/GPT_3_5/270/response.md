## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about a REST endpoint that fetches a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array containing 'stories' and 'events' objects.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.stories.available > return.events.available

## Analysis
- We have tried 1000 calls on the API and did not find a single counterexample to the invariant.
- There are 1500 examples in the requests data, with 26 distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the 'stories.available' values are consistently greater than the 'events.available' values.
- The invariant is consistent with the semantics of the variables in the context of the API.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent examples found, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which includes 'pageCount' and 'collectedIssues' fields.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.pageCount >= size(return.collectedIssues[])
This means that the number of story pages in the comic should be greater than or equal to the number of collected issues in the comic.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to assume that the number of story pages in a comic should be greater than or equal to the number of collected issues. This is because a comic with more collected issues is likely to have more story pages.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a true-positive. The confidence level is high given that 100 calls were made on the API without finding a single counterexample.

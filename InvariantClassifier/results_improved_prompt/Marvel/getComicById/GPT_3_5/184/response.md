## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that fetches a single comic by id.
- The response body contains a nested structure with the field 'extension' under 'data.results.images'.

## Invariant
- The invariant is LENGTH(return.extension)==3, which specifies that the length of the 'extension' string in the response body is always 3.

## Analysis
- The provided examples 'png' and 'jpg' both have a length of 3, which supports the invariant.
- The specification does not explicitly mention other possible values for the 'extension' field, and the examples provided cover a significant portion of the possible values.
- The invariant is consistent with the semantics of the 'extension' field, as it makes sense for file extensions to have a fixed length.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

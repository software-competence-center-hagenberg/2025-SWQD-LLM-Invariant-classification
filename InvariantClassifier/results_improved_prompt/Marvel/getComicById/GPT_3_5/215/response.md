## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes two string properties: 'copyright' and 'attributionText'.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.copyright is a substring of return.attributionText

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples.
- Example values of the variables: return.copyright=© 2022 MARVEL; return.attributionText=Data provided by Marvel. © 2022 MARVEL
- The example values of the variables support the invariant, as '© 2022 MARVEL' is a substring of 'Data provided by Marvel. © 2022 MARVEL'.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the values of 'copyright' and 'attributionText' that would contradict the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the example values, it is highly likely that the invariant 'return.copyright is a substring of return.attributionText' is a true-positive for this REST API.

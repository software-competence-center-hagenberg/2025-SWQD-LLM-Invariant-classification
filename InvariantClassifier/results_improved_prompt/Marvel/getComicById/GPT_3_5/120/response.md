## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'textObjects' array and a 'urls' array within the 'results' array.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.urls[])
This means that the number of elements in the 'textObjects' array should be less than or equal to the number of elements in the 'urls' array.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to assume that for each comic resource, the number of descriptive text blurbs (textObjects) should be less than or equal to the number of public web site URLs (urls) for that resource. This is a plausible constraint as it aligns with the structure of the response schema.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

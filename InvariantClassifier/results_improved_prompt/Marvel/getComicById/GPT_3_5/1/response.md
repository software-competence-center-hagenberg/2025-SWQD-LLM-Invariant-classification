## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about the REST endpoint and the response schema.
- The response schema includes a field 'type' under 'data.results.prices' which represents the type of price.

## Invariant
- The invariant specifies that the 'type' field under 'data.results.prices' should be one of {"digitalPurchasePrice", "printPrice"}.

## Analysis
- The provided examples of the 'type' field in the response data are 'printPrice' and 'digitalPurchasePrice', which align with the specified invariant.
- The invariant is consistent with the response schema and the nature of the 'type' field, which is expected to have a limited set of values.
- The large number of examples (17843) and the absence of any counterexamples (0) in 10000 calls indicate a high likelihood of the invariant being true.

## Conclusion
Based on the alignment with the response schema, the examples found, and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant is classified as true-positive.

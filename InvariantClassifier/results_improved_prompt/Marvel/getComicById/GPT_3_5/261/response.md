## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about the REST endpoint and the structure of the response.
- The response contains a field 'data' which has a field 'results' which in turn has a field 'stories' with a field 'returned'.

## Invariant
- The invariant is return.stories.returned >= 2
- This means that the number of stories returned in the collection should be greater than or equal to 2.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided examples, the invariant return.stories.returned >= 2 holds true for all 500 calls made to the API.
- The examples show that the values of return.data.results.stories.returned are 20, 12, 13, 10, and 11, all of which satisfy the invariant.
- The invariant is consistent with the structure of the response and the nature of the 'returned' field.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant return.stories.returned >= 2 is a true-positive. The examples collected from 500 calls support the correctness of the invariant, and it aligns with the response structure and the nature of the 'returned' field.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}"
  get:
    summary: Fetches a single comic by id.
    description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':

                  items:

                        available:
                          type: integer
                          description: The number of total available creators in this list. Will always be greater than or equal to the "returned" value.
                      properties:
                        returned:
                          type: integer
                          description: The number of creators returned in this collection (up to 20).


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.creators.available >= return.creators.returned

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of >= between two long scalars. Prints as x >= y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 48 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.data.results.creators.available=1; return.data.results.creators.returned=1
return.data.results.creators.available=2; return.data.results.creators.returned=2
return.data.results.creators.available=44; return.data.results.creators.returned=20
return.data.results.creators.available=50; return.data.results.creators.returned=20
return.data.results.creators.available=45; return.data.results.creators.returned=20

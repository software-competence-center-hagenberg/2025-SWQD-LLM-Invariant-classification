## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'status' field of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.status == "Ok"', which checks if the 'status' field in the response is equal to 'Ok'.

## Analysis
Based on the provided information, the invariant 'return.status == "Ok"' is likely a false-positive. The specification does not explicitly state that the 'status' field will always be 'Ok', and it is possible for the 'status' field to have other values based on different scenarios. Additionally, the semantic meaning of the 'status' field is not fully defined, so it cannot be assumed that it will always be 'Ok'.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive
Confidence: 0.8

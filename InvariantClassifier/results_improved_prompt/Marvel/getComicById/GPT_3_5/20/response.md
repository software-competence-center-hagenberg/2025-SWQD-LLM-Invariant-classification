## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method that fetches a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which in turn contains an 'urls' array.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.urls[] elements != null' states that all elements in the 'urls' array must not be null.

## Analysis
Based on the provided swagger definition and the extensive testing of 10000 calls, the invariant 'return.urls[] elements != null' has held true for all the tested cases. The swagger definition does not explicitly allow for null elements in the 'urls' array, and the extensive testing provides strong evidence in support of the invariant.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.95

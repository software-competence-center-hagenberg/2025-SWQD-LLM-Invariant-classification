## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about the REST endpoint and the response schema.
- The response schema includes a field 'issueNumber' under 'data.results', which is described as the number of the issue in the series.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.issueNumber >= 0.0', which specifies that the 'issueNumber' in the response must be greater than or equal to 0.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided examples, all the values of 'issueNumber' in the response are greater than or equal to 0.
- The description of 'issueNumber' in the swagger definition also indicates that it will generally be 0 for collection formats, which aligns with the invariant.
- The invariant is consistent with the semantics of the 'issueNumber' field in the context of comic series.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided examples and the alignment with the field description in the swagger definition, the invariant 'return.issueNumber >= 0.0' is classified as a true-positive.

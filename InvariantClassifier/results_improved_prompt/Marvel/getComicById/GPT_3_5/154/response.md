## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a 'get' operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array containing 'dates' and 'prices' arrays.

## Invariant
- The invariant is: size(return.dates[]) % size(return.prices[]) == 0
- It checks if the size of the 'dates' array is divisible by the size of the 'prices' array without remainder.

## Analysis
- We have tried 1000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- There are 1650 examples in the requests data, with 929 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that for each 'dates' array, the corresponding 'prices' array has the same size, satisfying the invariant.
- The examples cover a wide range of dates and prices, indicating that the invariant holds for various scenarios.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the diverse examples, the invariant 'size(return.dates[]) % size(return.prices[]) == 0' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

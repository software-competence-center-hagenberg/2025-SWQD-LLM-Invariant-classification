Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.variantDescription is a substring of return.title

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString
Invariant description: Represents the substring invariant between two String scalars. Prints as x is a substring of y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 1000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 1650 examples in the requests data, with 979 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.data.results.title=MS. MARVEL VOL. 3 HC (Hardcover); return.data.results.variantDescription=
return.data.results.title=Uncanny X-Men (1963) #275; return.data.results.variantDescription=
return.data.results.title=X-Force (2018) #6; return.data.results.variantDescription=
return.data.results.title=Skull the Slayer (1975) #4; return.data.results.variantDescription=

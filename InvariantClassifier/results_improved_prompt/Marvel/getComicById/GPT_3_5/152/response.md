## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'data.results' which contains 'collectedIssues' and 'images' arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.collectedIssues[])-1 <= size(return.images[])-1
This means that the number of collected issues in a comic should be less than or equal to the number of promotional images associated with the comic.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, it seems reasonable that the number of collected issues in a comic should be less than or equal to the number of promotional images associated with the comic. This is because it's unlikely for a comic to have more promotional images than collected issues.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

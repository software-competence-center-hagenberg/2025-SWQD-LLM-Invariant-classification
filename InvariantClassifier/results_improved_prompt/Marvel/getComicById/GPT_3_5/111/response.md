## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provides the endpoint for fetching a single comic by id. The response contains a list of comics with properties such as events and textObjects.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.events.available <= size(return.textObjects[])
This means that the number of available events should be less than or equal to the size of the textObjects array.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 33 distinct examples. The examples show that the number of available events is always less than or equal to the size of the textObjects array.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the examples and the absence of counterexamples, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The invariant holds for all the tested cases, and there is no indication in the specification that contradicts this invariant.

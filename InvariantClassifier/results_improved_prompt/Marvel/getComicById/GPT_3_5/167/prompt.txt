Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: "return.attributionText == ""Data provided by Marvel. \251 2022 MARVEL"""

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.OneOfString
Invariant description: Represents String variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:
return.attributionText=Data provided by Marvel. Â© 2022 MARVEL

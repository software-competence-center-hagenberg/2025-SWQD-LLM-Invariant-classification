## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains a 'dates' array of key dates for the comic.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.dates[] elements != null', which means that all elements in the 'dates' array should not be null.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to assume that the 'dates' array should not contain null elements, as it represents key dates for the comic.
- The specification does not explicitly mention the possibility of null elements in the 'dates' array.
- The invariant has been tested with 10000 calls on the API, and no counterexamples have been found.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing, the invariant 'return.dates[] elements != null' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

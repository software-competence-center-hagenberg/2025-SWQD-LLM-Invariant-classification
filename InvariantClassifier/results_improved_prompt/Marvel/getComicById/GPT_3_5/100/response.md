## Invariant
The invariant is: return.creators.returned >= size(return.textObjects[])-1
This invariant checks if the number of creators returned is greater than or equal to the size of the 'textObjects' array minus 1.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 96 examples, with 63 distinct examples. The examples demonstrate that the number of creators returned is indeed greater than or equal to the size of the 'textObjects' array minus 1.

## Conclusion

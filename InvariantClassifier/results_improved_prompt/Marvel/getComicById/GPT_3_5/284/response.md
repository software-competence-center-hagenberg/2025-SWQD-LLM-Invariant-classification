## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'data.results' which contains 'collectedIssues' and 'dates'.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.collectedIssues[])-1 != size(return.dates[])
This means that the size of 'collectedIssues' array minus 1 is not equal to the size of the 'dates' array.

## Analysis
Based on the provided swagger definition and the examples, it is highly unlikely that the size of 'collectedIssues' array minus 1 is always not equal to the size of the 'dates' array. The description of 'collectedIssues' even mentions that it will generally be empty for periodical formats, which implies that it can be empty and thus the invariant may not hold in such cases. Additionally, the specification does not explicitly restrict the relationship between the sizes of these arrays, leaving room for variability.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as a false-positive. The confidence in this classification is high due to the explicit mention of the variability in the specification and the lack of a clear restriction on the relationship between the sizes of the arrays.

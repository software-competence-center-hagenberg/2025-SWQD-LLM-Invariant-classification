## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains a 'dates' array.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.dates != null', which means that the 'dates' array in the response should not be null.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to assume that the 'dates' array should not be null in the response.
- The swagger definition does not explicitly state that the 'dates' array can be null, and the invariant aligns with the structure of the response schema.
- The invariant has been tested with 10000 calls on the API, and no counterexamples have been found, indicating a high likelihood of it being a true-positive.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing, the invariant 'return.dates != null' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

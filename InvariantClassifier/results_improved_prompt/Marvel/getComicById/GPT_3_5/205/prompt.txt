Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.creators.items[] is a superset of return.events.items[]

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoSequence.SuperSet
Invariant description: Represents two sequences of long values where one of the sequences is a subset of the other; that is each element of one sequence appears in the other. Prints as either x[] is a subset of y[] or as x[] is a superset of y[].
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

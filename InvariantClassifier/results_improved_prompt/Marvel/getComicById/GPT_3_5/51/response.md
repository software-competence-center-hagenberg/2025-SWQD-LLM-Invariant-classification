## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provides the endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID. The response contains a field `textObjects` which is an array of objects with properties `type`, `language`, and `text`.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the size of `return.textObjects[]` should be one of {0, 1, 2}.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the nature of the `textObjects` field, it is reasonable to expect that the size of the array can be limited to a small number of values. The examples provided show that the `textObjects` array typically contains one object, which aligns with the invariant. The examples also demonstrate that the `textObjects` array can contain multiple objects, supporting the invariant's claim that the size can be 2. However, the examples do not cover the case where the size of the array is 0, so it's unclear if this is a valid state for the API.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is likely a true-positive. The examples support the claim that the size of `return.textObjects[]` is typically 1 or 2, but the absence of examples for size 0 introduces some uncertainty. Therefore, the confidence in the classification is moderately high.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array containing 'characters' and 'events' objects.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.characters.returned >= return.events.available

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 37 distinct examples found in the 1000 calls made to the API. The examples demonstrate that the number of characters returned is always greater than or equal to the number of total available events in the list. The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on these values, and the examples cover a wide range of combinations, providing strong evidence for the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

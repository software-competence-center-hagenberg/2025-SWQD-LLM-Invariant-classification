## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides a clear structure for the response of the API endpoint.
- The response contains an array of URLs and an array of images associated with the comic.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the 'urls' array in the response should not be equal to the size of the 'images' array minus 1.

## Analysis
- The invariant is based on the assumption that there is a relationship between the sizes of the 'urls' and 'images' arrays.
- However, the swagger definition does not explicitly specify a relationship between the sizes of these arrays.
- Without a clear specification, it is possible that the 'urls' and 'images' arrays are independent and may not have a consistent relationship in size.
- The invariant does not align with the explicit information provided in the swagger definition.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive. The lack of explicit specification about the relationship between the sizes of the 'urls' and 'images' arrays makes the invariant invalid. Therefore, the verdict is false-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint fetches a single comic by id and returns a response containing information about the comic.
- The response contains a list of events and a list of images associated with the comic.

## Invariant
- The invariant is: return.events.available <= size(return.images[])
- This means that the number of available events should be less than or equal to the size of the list of images.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all the tested cases.
- The examples show that the number of available events is always 0, and the size of the list of images is always 1.
- This indicates that the invariant is likely a false-positive, as it does not hold for a variety of scenarios.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as a false-positive with a low confidence due to the limited variety of scenarios tested.

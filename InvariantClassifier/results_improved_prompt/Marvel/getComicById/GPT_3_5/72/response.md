## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provides the endpoint for fetching a single comic by id. The response contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, where each item in the array has a 'digitalId' field and a 'textObjects' array.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.digitalId >= size(return.textObjects[])-1
This means that the 'digitalId' in the response should be greater than or equal to the size of the 'textObjects' array minus 1.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the 'digitalId' and 'textObjects' fields are present in the response, and the invariant holds true for all the examples provided. The 'digitalId' is always greater than or equal to the size of the 'textObjects' array minus 1 in the examples.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the response, it is likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The examples cover a variety of 'textObjects' arrays, and the 'digitalId' consistently meets the condition specified in the invariant. Therefore, the verdict is true-positive with high confidence.

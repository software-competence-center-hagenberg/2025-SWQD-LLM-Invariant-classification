## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a 'get' operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array containing comic information, including 'pageCount' and 'prices'.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.pageCount % size(return.prices[]) == 0
This invariant checks if the 'pageCount' is divisible by the number of prices in the 'prices' array without a remainder.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the response schema, it is likely that the 'pageCount' should be divisible by the number of prices for the comic. The examples provided show different 'pageCount' values and corresponding 'prices' arrays, and in each case, the invariant holds true.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the large number of examples tested, it is classified as a true-positive invariant with high confidence.

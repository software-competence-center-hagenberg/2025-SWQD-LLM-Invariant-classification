## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which includes 'collectedIssues' and 'prices' arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.collectedIssues[]) <= size(return.prices[])-1

## Analysis
- The invariant compares the size of the 'collectedIssues' array with the size of the 'prices' array minus 1.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the sizes of these arrays.
- The invariant does not violate the semantics of the variables involved.
- 100 calls have been made on the API, and no counterexamples have been found.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing, the invariant is classified as a true-positive.

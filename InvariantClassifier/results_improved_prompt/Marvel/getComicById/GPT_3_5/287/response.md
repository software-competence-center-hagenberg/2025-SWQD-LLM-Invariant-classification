## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes 'data.results' containing 'collectedIssues' and 'images' arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the size of 'collectedIssues' array minus 1 should not be equal to the size of the 'images' array.

## Analysis
- The invariant seems to be based on the assumption that the number of collected issues in a comic should not be equal to the number of promotional images associated with the comic.
- However, the specification does not explicitly state any relationship between the number of collected issues and the number of images.
- Without a clear specification constraint, the invariant may not hold for all valid requests.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as a false-positive. The confidence level is moderate due to the lack of explicit specification constraints regarding the relationship between the number of collected issues and images.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint fetches a single comic by id and returns a response containing textObjects and prices.

## Invariant
- The invariant is size(return.textObjects[])-1 <= size(return.prices[]), which means that the number of textObjects minus 1 should be less than or equal to the number of prices.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 7702 examples in the requests data, with 5048 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that for each call, the number of textObjects is either equal to the number of prices or one less than the number of prices.
- The examples support the invariant, indicating that it holds true for the given API.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

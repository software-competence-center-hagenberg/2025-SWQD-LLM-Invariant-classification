## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a property "data" with a sub-property "limit" of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.comicId > return.data.limit

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 1000 calls made to the API. The examples show that the value of input.comicId is always greater than the value of return.data.limit, which aligns with the semantics of the API endpoint. The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the values of comicId or data.limit that would contradict this invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a 'data' object, which contains a 'results' array, and within each result, there is an 'images' array with an 'extension' field.
- The 'extension' field is a string representing the file extension for the image.

## Invariant
The invariant is "return.extension one of { ""jpg"", ""png"" }", which specifies that the 'extension' field in the 'images' array should be either "jpg" or "png".

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the nature of file extensions for images, it is reasonable to expect that the 'extension' field should only have values of "jpg" or "png". The examples provided also support this expectation.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a true-positive with high confidence, as the nature of file extensions for images and the provided examples strongly support the expectation that the 'extension' field should only have values of "jpg" or "png".

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint fetches a single comic by id and returns the comic resource.
- The response contains a list of prices for the comic and a list of promotional images associated with the comic.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the size of the list of prices for the comic minus 1 should be less than or equal to the size of the list of promotional images associated with the comic.
- The invariant type is daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntLessEqual, representing an invariant of <= between two long scalars.

## Analysis
- We have tried 1000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample to the invariant.
- There are 1588 examples in the requests data, with 944 of them being distinct examples, indicating a wide range of test cases.
- The examples provided show that for each comic, the number of prices is either equal to the number of images or one less than the number of images.
- The invariant holds true for all the examples tested.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

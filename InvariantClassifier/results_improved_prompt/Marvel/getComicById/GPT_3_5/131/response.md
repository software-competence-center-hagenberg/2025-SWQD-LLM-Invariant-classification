## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'results' field, which contains an array of comics with 'urls' and 'dates' fields.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.urls[]) <= size(return.dates[])
This means that the number of URLs for the comic should be less than or equal to the number of dates for the comic.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to assume that each comic may have a set of URLs and a set of dates associated with it. The invariant checks if the number of URLs is less than or equal to the number of dates, which aligns with the structure of the response schema.

## Conclusion
Given the structure of the response schema and the absence of counterexamples after 10000 calls, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The invariant aligns with the expected structure of the response and holds true for the tested data.

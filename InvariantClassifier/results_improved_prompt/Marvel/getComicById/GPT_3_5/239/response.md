## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'textObjects' array and an 'events' object within the 'results' array.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.textObjects[]) >= size(return.events.items[])-1
This means that the number of elements in the 'textObjects' array should be greater than or equal to the number of elements in the 'events.items' array minus 1.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, it seems unlikely that the number of 'textObjects' would be directly related to the number of 'events.items'. There is no explicit relationship between these two arrays in the specification, and the invariant does not align with the semantics of the API.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a false-positive because the specification does not support the relationship implied by the invariant. The confidence level is high given the lack of semantic alignment and the absence of a clear relationship in the specification.

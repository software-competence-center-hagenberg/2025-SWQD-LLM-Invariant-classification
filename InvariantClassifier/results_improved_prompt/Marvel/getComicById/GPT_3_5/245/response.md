## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which includes 'collectedIssues' and 'dates' arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.collectedIssues[]) < size(return.dates[])-1

## Analysis
- The invariant checks if the size of the 'collectedIssues' array is less than the size of the 'dates' array minus 1.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the sizes of these arrays.
- The invariant is reasonable as it compares the sizes of two arrays in the response.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a true-positive with a high confidence, as it is based on the response structure and has been validated with 100 API calls.

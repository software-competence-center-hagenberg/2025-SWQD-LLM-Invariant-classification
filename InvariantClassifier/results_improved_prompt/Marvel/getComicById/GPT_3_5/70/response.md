## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides the endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes the fields 'digitalId' and 'stories.available' under 'data.results'.

## Invariant
The invariant is that 'return.digitalId' is not equal to 'return.stories.available'.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 11650 examples, with 6115 distinct examples.
- The examples demonstrate that for every valid request, the 'digitalId' and 'stories.available' are not equal.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints or relationships between 'digitalId' and 'stories.available'.
- The semantics of 'digitalId' and 'stories.available' do not suggest any inherent relationship that would require them to be equal.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.digitalId != return.stories.available' is a true-positive. The examples provide strong evidence that the invariant holds for all valid requests, and the semantics of the variables do not contradict the invariant. Therefore, the verdict is true-positive with high confidence.

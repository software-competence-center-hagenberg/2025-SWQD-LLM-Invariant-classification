## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method that fetches a single comic by id.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which in turn contains an 'images' array.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.images[] elements != null' states that all elements in the 'images' array must not be null.

## Analysis
Based on the provided swagger definition and the extensive testing of 10000 calls, the invariant 'return.images[] elements != null' holds true for all the responses. The 'images' array is described as a list of promotional images associated with the comic, and it is reasonable to expect that all elements in this array should not be null.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

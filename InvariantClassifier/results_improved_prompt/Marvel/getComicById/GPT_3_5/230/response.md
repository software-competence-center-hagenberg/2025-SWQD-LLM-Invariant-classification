## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' fetches a single comic by id.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which includes 'characters' and 'collectedIssues' properties.

## Invariant
The invariant states that 'return.characters.available' should be greater than the size of 'return.collectedIssues[]'.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to assume that the number of available characters should be greater than the size of collected issues in a comic. This is consistent with the typical relationship between characters and issues in a comic.

## Conclusion
Given the nature of the comic resource and the relationship between characters and issues, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The extensive testing with 100 calls further supports the confidence in the correctness of the invariant.

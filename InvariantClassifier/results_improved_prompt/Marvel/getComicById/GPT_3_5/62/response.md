## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint fetches a single comic by ID and returns a list of text objects for the comic.
- The 'textObjects' field in the response contains an array of descriptive text blurbs for the comic.
- The 'comicId' is a required parameter of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.comicId > size(return.textObjects[])
This means that the 'comicId' in the request should be greater than the number of text objects returned in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the 'comicId' in the request is always greater than the number of text objects returned in the response. This is consistent with the invariant.

## Conclusion
The invariant holds true for all the examples tested, and it aligns with the semantics of the API endpoint. Therefore, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

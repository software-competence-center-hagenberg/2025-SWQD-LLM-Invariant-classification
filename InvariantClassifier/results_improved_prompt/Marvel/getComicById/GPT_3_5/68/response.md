## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response contains a list of images associated with the comic.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.comicId > size(return.images[])
This means that the ID of the comic should be greater than the number of images returned.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, we have tried 10000 calls on the API and did not find a single counterexample. Additionally, we found 11247 examples in the requests data, with 7352 of them being distinct examples. The examples provided also show that the comic ID is consistently greater than the number of images returned for each call.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples provided, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The invariant holds for every valid request on the API, and the confidence in this classification is very high.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response contains a list of collected issues for the comic.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.comicId > size(return.collectedIssues[])
This means that the ID of the comic should be greater than the number of collected issues returned in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all 341 examples, with 228 distinct examples. The examples show that the comic ID is always greater than the number of collected issues returned in the response. This is consistent with the semantics of the API, as a comic ID should logically be greater than the number of collected issues.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as a true-positive. The high number of examples and the consistency with the API semantics provide a high level of confidence in this classification.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which includes 'stories' with 'available' and 'items' fields.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.stories.available == size(return.stories.items[])
This means that the number of total available stories in the list should be equal to the size of the list of returned stories.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the examples, the invariant seems to hold true for the given API. The 'available' field represents the total available stories, and the 'items' field contains the list of returned stories. It makes sense that the number of available stories should be equal to the size of the returned stories list.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

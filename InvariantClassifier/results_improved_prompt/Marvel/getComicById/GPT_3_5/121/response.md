## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provided describes a REST endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID. The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which includes 'textObjects' and 'dates' arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the 'textObjects' array should be less than or equal to the size of the 'dates' array minus 1.

## Analysis
Based on the provided swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to assume that for each comic resource, the number of text objects should be related to the number of dates for the comic. The invariant suggests that there should be at most one less text object than the number of dates, which seems plausible in the context of a comic resource.

## Conclusion
Given the context of the comic resource and the absence of counterexamples in 100 calls, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

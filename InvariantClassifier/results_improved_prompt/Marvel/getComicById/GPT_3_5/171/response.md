## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'total' field under 'data' which is an integer representing the total number of resources available.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.data.total == 1', which means that the total number of resources available should always be 1.

## Analysis
Based on the provided information, the invariant 'return.data.total == 1' seems to be a false-positive. The specification does not explicitly state that the total number of resources available should always be 1. It is possible for the API to have more than one resource available, and the invariant does not align with the flexibility allowed by the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive
Confidence: 0.9

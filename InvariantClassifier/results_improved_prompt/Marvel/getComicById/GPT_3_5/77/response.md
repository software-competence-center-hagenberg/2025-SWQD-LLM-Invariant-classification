## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'digitalId' field and a 'dates' field, both nested within the 'results' field.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.digitalId != size(return.dates[])-1', which means that the 'digitalId' should not be equal to the size of 'dates' array minus 1.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 7128 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the 'digitalId' is always 0, and the 'dates' array contains two elements, which makes the invariant hold for all the examples.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the 'digitalId' or 'dates' array that would contradict the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.digitalId != size(return.dates[])-1' is likely a true-positive, as it holds for all the examples tested and is not contradicted by the specification.

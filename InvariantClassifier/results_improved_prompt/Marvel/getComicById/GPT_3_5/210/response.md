## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a property 'attributionText' of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant is LENGTH(return.attributionText)==38, indicating that the length of the 'attributionText' in the response is always 38 characters.

## Analysis
Based on the provided example value of 'attributionText' ("Data provided by Marvel. Â© 2022 MARVEL"), the length is 38 characters, which supports the invariant. However, the specification does not explicitly state that the length of 'attributionText' should always be 38 characters.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive. While the example value supports the invariant, the specification does not enforce a fixed length for 'attributionText'. Therefore, the invariant may not hold for all valid requests on the API.

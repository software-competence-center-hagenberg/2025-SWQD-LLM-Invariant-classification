## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provides the endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID. The response schema includes a 'digitalId' field and a 'urls' field, both of which are part of the 'data.results' object.

## Invariant
The invariant states that 'return.digitalId' should not be equal to the size of 'return.urls[]'. This means that the digital ID of the comic should not be equal to the number of URLs returned.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the 'digitalId' is always 0, and the 'urls' array contains URLs with different types but the same 'url' value. This means that for all the examples, the invariant holds true.

## Conclusion
Given the examples and the nature of the response data, it is likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The 'digitalId' being 0 and the 'urls' array containing similar URLs for different types supports the invariant. Therefore, the verdict is true-positive with high confidence.

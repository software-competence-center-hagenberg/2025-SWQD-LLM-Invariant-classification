## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint fetches a single comic by ID and returns information about the comic, including digital ID and collections.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.digitalId >= size(return.collections[])
This means that the digital ID of the comic should be greater than or equal to the number of collections it belongs to.

## Analysis
- We have tried 500 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- We found 94 examples in the requests data, with 72 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the digital ID is indeed greater than or equal to the number of collections for each comic.
- The invariant makes semantic sense in the context of the API, as a comic with a digital representation should logically be associated with at least as many collections as its digital ID.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the semantic coherence of the invariant with the API, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint fetches a single comic by ID and returns a response containing information about the comic.
- The response contains a list of collected issues and a list of promotional images associated with the comic.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the list of collected issues should be less than or equal to the size of the list of promotional images.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the nature of the API, it is reasonable to assume that the number of collected issues for a comic would be less than or equal to the number of promotional images associated with the comic. This is because a comic may have multiple promotional images but may not necessarily have the same number of collected issues. Therefore, the invariant seems to hold true based on the API's behavior.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

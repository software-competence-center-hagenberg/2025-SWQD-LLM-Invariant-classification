## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which includes 'urls' and 'dates' arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant is size(return.urls[])-1 <= size(return.dates[])-1, which means that the size of the 'urls' array minus 1 should be less than or equal to the size of the 'dates' array minus 1.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'urls' and 'dates' arrays are both part of the 'results' array in the response body. The invariant suggests that the size of 'urls' should be less than or equal to the size of 'dates', which seems reasonable given that both arrays are part of the same 'results' array.

## Conclusion
Given the analysis and the large number of examples tested (11650), with 7633 distinct examples, and no counterexamples found, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive.

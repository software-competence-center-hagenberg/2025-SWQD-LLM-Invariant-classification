## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a 'get' operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array containing 'pageCount' and 'variants' fields.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.pageCount >= size(return.variants[])-1', which means that the number of story pages in the comic should be greater than or equal to the number of variant issues minus 1.

## Analysis
- We have tried 500 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- There are 87 distinct examples in the requests data, which provides a substantial sample size.
- The examples provided show that the 'pageCount' is consistently greater than or equal to the size of 'variants' array minus 1.
- The invariant is consistent with the examples and does not contradict the API specification.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the substantial sample size, the invariant 'return.pageCount >= size(return.variants[])-1' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

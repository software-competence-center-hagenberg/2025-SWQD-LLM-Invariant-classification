## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method that fetches a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which includes 'textObjects' and 'images' arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.textObjects[])-1 <= size(return.images[])
This means that the number of 'textObjects' minus 1 should be less than or equal to the number of 'images'.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, it is unlikely that the invariant holds true for every valid request on the API. The invariant does not seem to have a clear semantic relationship with the 'textObjects' and 'images' arrays, and the specification does not explicitly state any relationship between the sizes of these arrays. Additionally, the invariant does not align with the structure of the response body, and there is no evident reason why the size of 'textObjects' minus 1 should be related to the size of 'images'.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as a false-positive with low confidence.

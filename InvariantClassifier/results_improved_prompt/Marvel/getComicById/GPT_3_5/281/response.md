## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes 'collectedIssues' and 'dates' as arrays under 'data.results'.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the size of 'collectedIssues' array should not be equal to the size of the 'dates' array in the response.

## Analysis
- The invariant is based on the comparison of the sizes of two arrays in the response.
- The specification does not explicitly state any relationship or constraint between the sizes of these arrays.
- The semantics of the 'collectedIssues' and 'dates' arrays do not inherently imply a specific relationship between their sizes.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive. The specification does not provide any indication that the sizes of 'collectedIssues' and 'dates' arrays should be unequal for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

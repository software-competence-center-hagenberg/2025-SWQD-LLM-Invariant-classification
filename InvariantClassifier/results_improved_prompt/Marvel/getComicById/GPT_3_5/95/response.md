## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a 'get' operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'creators' and 'textObjects' fields under 'data.results'.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.creators.available >= size(return.textObjects[])-1'.
- It checks if the number of available creators is greater than or equal to the size of the 'textObjects' array minus 1.

## Analysis
- We have tried 100 calls on the API and found 96 examples, with 63 distinct examples, all of which satisfy the invariant.
- The examples show that the number of available creators is indeed greater than or equal to the size of the 'textObjects' array minus 1.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the relationship between 'creators.available' and 'textObjects'.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the examples, the invariant 'return.creators.available >= size(return.textObjects[])-1' is likely a true-positive. The examples from the API calls support the correctness of the invariant, and the specification does not contradict it. Therefore, the verdict is 'true-positive' with high confidence.

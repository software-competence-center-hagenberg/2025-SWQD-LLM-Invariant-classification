## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which in turn contains an 'images' array.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.images != null', which means that the 'images' array in the response body should not be null.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, it is likely that the 'images' array in the response body should not be null. The definition does not explicitly state that the 'images' array can be null, and the invariant aligns with the structure of the response.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

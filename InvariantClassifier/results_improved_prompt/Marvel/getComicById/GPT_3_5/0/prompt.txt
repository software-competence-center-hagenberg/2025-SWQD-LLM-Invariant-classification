Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: "return.extension == ""jpg"""

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.OneOfString
Invariant description: Represents String variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results.images" in the response body.

We have tried 1000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 2622 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:
return.data.results.images.extension=jpg

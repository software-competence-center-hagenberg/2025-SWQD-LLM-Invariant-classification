## Invariant
The invariant is "return.extension == "jpg"", which specifies that the file extension for the image in the response must be "jpg".

## Analysis
- The invariant is a unary string invariant, which checks if the variable 'return.data.results.images.extension' is equal to "jpg".
- The example provided in the request data shows that the variable 'return.data.results.images.extension' is indeed equal to "jpg".
- The number of examples found in the request data is 2622, with 1 distinct example.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided information, the invariant "return.extension == "jpg"" is classified as a true-positive. The invariant holds for every valid request on the API, and the high number of examples and the absence of counterexamples provide a high level of confidence in this classification.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' fetches a single comic resource.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which includes 'textObjects' and 'urls' arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.textObjects[])-1 <= size(return.urls[])-1
This means that the number of elements in the 'textObjects' array minus 1 is less than or equal to the number of elements in the 'urls' array minus 1.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the examples, the invariant seems to hold true for the given API. The 'textObjects' and 'urls' arrays are both part of the 'results' array in the response, and it is reasonable to assume that the number of text objects would be less than or equal to the number of URLs for a single comic resource.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.95

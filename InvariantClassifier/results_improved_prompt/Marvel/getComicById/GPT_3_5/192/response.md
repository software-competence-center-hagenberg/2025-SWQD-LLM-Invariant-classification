## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about the REST endpoint for fetching a single comic by id.
- The response body contains a field 'resourceURI' under 'data.results', which is described as the canonical URL identifier for the resource.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that 'return.data.results.resourceURI' is Url, indicating that the value of the 'resourceURI' field is always a URL.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided examples, all the values of 'return.data.results.resourceURI' are valid URLs starting with 'http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics/'.
- The description in the swagger definition also supports the interpretation that 'resourceURI' should be a URL.
- The invariant has been tested with a large number of calls (10000) and no counterexamples have been found.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.data.results.resourceURI is Url' is likely a true-positive. The examples and the swagger definition support the interpretation that 'resourceURI' should always be a URL, and the extensive testing provides high confidence in the correctness of the invariant.

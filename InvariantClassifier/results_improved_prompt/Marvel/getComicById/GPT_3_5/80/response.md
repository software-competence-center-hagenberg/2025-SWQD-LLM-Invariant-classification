## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array containing 'digitalId' and 'images' fields.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.digitalId >= size(return.images[])-1', which means that the 'digitalId' should be greater than or equal to the size of the 'images' array minus 1.

## Analysis
- We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- There are 141 examples in the requests data, with 95 distinct examples, indicating a good coverage.
- The examples provided show that the 'digitalId' is always greater than or equal to the size of the 'images' array minus 1.
- The invariant makes semantic sense as the 'digitalId' should be related to the number of images associated with the comic.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the semantic relevance of the invariant, I classify this invariant as a true-positive with high confidence.

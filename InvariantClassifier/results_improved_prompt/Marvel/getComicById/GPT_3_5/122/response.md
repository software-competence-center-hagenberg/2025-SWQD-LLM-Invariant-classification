## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provided describes a REST endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID. The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which includes 'textObjects' and 'prices' arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the 'textObjects' array should be less than or equal to the size of the 'prices' array in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the nature of the response, it is reasonable to expect that the number of text objects for a comic should be less than or equal to the number of prices for that comic. This is because each text object may correspond to a specific price or type of price for the comic. The examples provided also support this expectation.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

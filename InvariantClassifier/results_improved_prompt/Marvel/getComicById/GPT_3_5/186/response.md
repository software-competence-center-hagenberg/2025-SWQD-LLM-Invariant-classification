## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides information about a REST endpoint that fetches a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a nested structure with the field 'textObjects.language' representing the language of the text object.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the length of the 'language' field in 'textObjects' is always 5 characters.

## Analysis
- The specification does not explicitly mention the length of the 'language' field in 'textObjects'.
- The example provided in the request data supports the invariant by showing a 'language' value of 'en-us', which is 5 characters long.
- The invariant has been tested with a large number of calls (10000) and no counterexamples have been found.

## Conclusion
Based on the information available and the extensive testing, the invariant 'LENGTH(return.language)==5' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'results' array containing 'urls' and 'prices' arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.urls[]) >= size(return.prices[])

## Analysis
- The invariant compares the sizes of the 'urls' and 'prices' arrays in the response.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the sizes of these arrays.
- The invariant is reasonable as it ensures that there are at least as many URLs as there are prices for the comic.
- The large number of examples (11650) and distinct examples (7633) in the requests data provide strong evidence for the invariant holding true.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing with 10000 calls, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint fetches a single comic by id and returns a response containing the comic details.
- The response includes a field 'pageCount' representing the number of story pages in the comic, and a field 'variants' representing a list of variant issues for the comic.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the 'pageCount' of the comic returned should be greater than or equal to the size of the 'variants' array.

## Analysis
- We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 29 examples in the requests data, with 20 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that for each request, the 'pageCount' is indeed greater than or equal to the size of the 'variants' array.
- The invariant aligns with the semantics of the fields in the response and is consistent with the examples found.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the examples found, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

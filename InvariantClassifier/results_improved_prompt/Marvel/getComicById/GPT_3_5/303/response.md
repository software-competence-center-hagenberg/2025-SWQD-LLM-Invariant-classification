## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'thumbnail' object with an 'extension' property of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant is "return.thumbnail.extension one of { ""jpg"", ""png"" }" which specifies that the 'extension' property of the 'thumbnail' object should be either "jpg" or "png".

## Analysis

The response schema does not mention any other possible values for the 'extension' property, and the examples provided also confirm that the values are limited to "jpg" and "png".

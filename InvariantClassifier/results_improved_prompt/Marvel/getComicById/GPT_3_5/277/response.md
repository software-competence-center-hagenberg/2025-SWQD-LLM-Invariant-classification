## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provided describes a REST endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID. The response schema includes a property 'data.results' which contains an array of comics. Each comic in the array has 'textObjects' and 'urls' properties, both of which are arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the 'textObjects' array minus 1 should be less than or equal to the size of the 'urls' array.

## Analysis
Based on the provided schema, the 'textObjects' and 'urls' arrays are both properties of each comic in the 'data.results' array. The invariant compares the sizes of these arrays within each comic. The invariant does not explicitly contradict the schema, and the number of examples tested (7702, with 5098 distinct examples) provides a substantial sample size.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant appears to be a true-positive. The comparison of the sizes of 'textObjects' and 'urls' arrays within each comic is consistent with the schema, and the large number of examples tested supports the likelihood of the invariant holding true for every valid request on the API.

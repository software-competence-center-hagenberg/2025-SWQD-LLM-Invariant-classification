## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint fetches a single comic by ID and returns information about the comic, including the number of stories and the prices.
- The response contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which includes 'stories' and 'prices' arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.stories.returned >= size(return.prices[])
This means that the number of stories returned should be greater than or equal to the number of prices returned.

## Analysis
- We have tried 500 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- We found 500 examples in the requests data, with 77 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided also show that the invariant holds true for the given data.
- The examples demonstrate that the number of stories returned is always greater than or equal to the number of prices returned.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any constraints on the relationship between the number of stories and the number of prices, so the invariant is not contradicted by the specification.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the examples provided, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

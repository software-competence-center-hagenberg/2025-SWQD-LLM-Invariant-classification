## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a 'get' operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes the 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains 'resourceURI' and 'stories' objects.

## Invariant
- The invariant is that 'return.resourceURI' is a substring of 'return.stories.collectionURI'.
- This means that the 'resourceURI' value is a substring of the 'collectionURI' value.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- We found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 7623 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the 'resourceURI' values are indeed substrings of the corresponding 'collectionURI' values.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the format of 'resourceURI' and 'collectionURI', so the invariant does not contradict the specification.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, along with the alignment of the examples with the invariant, the invariant 'return.resourceURI' is a substring of 'return.stories.collectionURI' is classified as a true-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'stories' object with an 'available' field representing the number of total available stories.

## Invariant
The invariant is input.comicId > return.stories.available, which states that the input comic ID should be greater than the number of available stories in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, we have tried 10000 calls on the API and did not find a single counterexample. We have 11650 examples in the requests data, with 7623 of them being distinct examples. The examples provided also show that the input comic ID is consistently greater than the number of available stories in the response.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent examples, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

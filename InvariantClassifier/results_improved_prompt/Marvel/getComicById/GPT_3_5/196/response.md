## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provides information about the REST endpoint and the structure of the response.

## Invariant
The invariant is that `return.data.results.creators.collectionURI` is a URL.

## Analysis
We have tried 10000 calls on the API and found 11650 examples in the requests data, with 7623 of them being distinct examples. All of these examples have `return.data.results.creators.collectionURI` values that start with 'http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics/'. This indicates that the values are URLs.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistent examples found, the invariant `return.data.results.creators.collectionURI` is Url is a true-positive.

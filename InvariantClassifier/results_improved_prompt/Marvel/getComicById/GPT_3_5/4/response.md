## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a 'textObjects' array, each item of which has a 'language' field denoting the language of the text object.

## Invariant
The invariant is a unary string invariant of the form 'return.language == "en-us"'. It specifies that the 'language' field in the 'textObjects' array of the response must be 'en-us'.

## Analysis
Based on the provided example value 'return.data.results.textObjects.language=en-us' and the large number of examples (9361) with 1 distinct value, it is highly likely that the invariant holds for the given API. The specification does not explicitly mention other possible values for the 'language' field, and the invariant aligns with the semantics of the field.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

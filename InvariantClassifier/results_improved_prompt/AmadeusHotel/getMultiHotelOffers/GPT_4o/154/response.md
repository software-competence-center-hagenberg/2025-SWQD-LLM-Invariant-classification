### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` is a GET request that retrieves hotel offers. It accepts a query parameter `currency`, which is a string representing an ISO currency code. The response includes a `data` object, which is an array of items, each containing a `self` field that is a string.

### Invariant

The invariant states that the `input.currency` is a substring of `return.self`. This means that the currency code provided in the request should appear somewhere within the `self` URL string in the response.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The `currency` parameter is used to specify the desired currency for the hotel offers. The specification mentions that if a hotel does not support the requested currency, prices will be returned in the local currency. However, the invariant is about the presence of the currency code in the `self` URL, not about the actual currency used in the offers.

2. **Examples and Calls**: We have 10,000 calls with no counterexamples and 8,951 distinct examples where the invariant holds. The examples provided show that the `currency` parameter is included in the `self` URL as a query parameter (e.g., `currency=KRW`).

3. **Semantic Analysis**: The `self` URL is likely a reference link to the specific hotel offer request, including the parameters used in the request. It makes sense for the `currency` parameter to be included in this URL, as it is part of the query parameters that define the request.

### Conclusion

Given the high number of examples and the semantic reasoning that the `currency` parameter should appear in the `self` URL as part of the query parameters, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of including request parameters in the response URL for reference purposes.

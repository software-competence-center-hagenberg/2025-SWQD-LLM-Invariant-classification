### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` is designed to retrieve hotel offers. The response includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`. Each offer has a `price` object, which includes `variations` that describe daily price variations and average daily price information. Specifically, the `average` property contains a `total` field described as `total = base + totalTaxes`, and it is of type `string`.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.price.variations.average.total == "126.73"`.

### Analysis
- **Type and Description**: The `total` field is a string, which represents a total price value. The invariant suggests that this field always equals "126.73".
- **Number of Calls and Examples**: The invariant was tested over 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, only 2 examples were observed, with just 1 distinct example.
- **Semantic Context**: The `total` field represents a price, which typically varies depending on the hotel offer, date, and other factors. It is unlikely that all hotel offers would have the same total price of "126.73" consistently across different requests.
- **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not restrict the `total` field to a specific value, implying it can vary.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic context of the `total` field as a price, which is expected to vary, and the limited number of distinct examples, it is highly unlikely that this invariant holds true universally. The invariant is likely a result of insufficient data diversity in the test cases.

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** with high confidence.

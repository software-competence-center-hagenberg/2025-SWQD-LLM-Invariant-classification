### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint:** `/shopping/hotel-offers`
- **Method:** GET
- **Parameters:**
  - `hotelIds`: An array of Amadeus property codes, mandatory for searching by a predefined list of hotels.
- **Response Schema:**
  - `data`: An array containing `offers`.
    - `offers`: Contains `policies`.
      - `policies`: Contains `guarantee`.
        - `guarantee`: Contains `acceptedPayments`.
          - `acceptedPayments`: Contains `methods`, an array of accepted payment methods.

### Invariant

- **Invariant:** `size(input.hotelIds[])-1 % size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0`
- **Invariant Type:** NumericInt$Divides
- **Description:** Checks if the size of `hotelIds` minus one divides evenly by the size of `acceptedPayments.methods`.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis:**
   - `hotelIds` is a list of hotel identifiers, and `acceptedPayments.methods` is a list of payment methods.
   - There is no direct semantic relationship between the number of hotel IDs and the number of payment methods.

2. **Statistical Evidence:**
   - 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 20 distinct examples were found where the invariant held.

3. **Specification Check:**
   - The specification does not mention any relationship between the number of hotel IDs and the number of payment methods.
   - The invariant seems arbitrary as there is no logical reason why the number of hotel IDs minus one should divide the number of payment methods.

### Conclusion

The invariant seems to be a "false-positive" because:
- There is no semantic or logical basis for the invariant.
- The invariant is not supported by the specification.
- The relationship between the number of hotel IDs and the number of payment methods is not meaningful.

Given these points, the invariant is likely coincidental based on the limited data set.

### Confidence

Confidence in this classification is high due to the lack of semantic connection and specification support for the invariant.

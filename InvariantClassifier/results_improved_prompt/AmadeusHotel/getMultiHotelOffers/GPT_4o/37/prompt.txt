Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: "return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[] elements == ""CREDIT_CARD"""

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.stringsequence.EltOneOfString
Invariant description: Represents sequences of String values where the elements of the sequence take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x[] elements == c (when there is only one value), or as x[] elements one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 50 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 41 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:
return.data.offers.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods=["CREDIT_CARD"]

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides hotel offers, and the response includes a `data` array. Each item in this array has an `offers` array, which contains `policies`. Within `policies`, there is a `guarantee` object that includes `acceptedPayments`. The `acceptedPayments` object has a `methods` array, which lists the accepted payment methods for the offer. The possible values for `methods` include:
- CREDIT_CARD
- AGENCY_ACCOUNT
- TRAVEL_AGENT_ID
- CORPORATE_ID
- HOTEL_GUEST_ID
- CHECK
- MISC_CHARGE_ORDER
- ADVANCE_DEPOSIT
- COMPANY_ADDRESS

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: "`return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[] elements == "CREDIT_CARD"`". This suggests that every element in the `methods` array is "CREDIT_CARD".

### Analysis

- **Number of Calls**: 50 calls were made to the API.
- **Examples Found**: 41 examples were found, with only 1 distinct example, which is `methods=["CREDIT_CARD"]`.
- **Specification**: The specification explicitly lists multiple possible values for `methods`, indicating that other values besides "CREDIT_CARD" are valid.

Given the specification, the `methods` array can contain several different payment methods, not just "CREDIT_CARD". The invariant suggests that only "CREDIT_CARD" is used, which contradicts the specification that allows for multiple payment methods.

### Conclusion

The invariant is likely a "false-positive" because the specification explicitly allows for multiple values in the `methods` array, and the invariant restricts it to only "CREDIT_CARD". The lack of counterexamples in 50 calls might be due to limited data or specific conditions under which the API was tested, but it does not align with the documented specification.

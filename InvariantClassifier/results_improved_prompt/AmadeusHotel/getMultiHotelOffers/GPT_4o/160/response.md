### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides a response containing a `data` array. Each item in this array has a `self` field of type string and a `hotel` object with a `hotelId` field. The `hotelId` is described as an 8-character string consisting of uppercase letters and digits, matching the regex pattern `^[A-Z0-9]{8}$`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.hotel.hotelId` is a substring of `return.self`. This implies that the `hotelId` should appear somewhere within the URL string provided by `self`.

### Analysis
1. **Pattern Matching**: The `hotelId` is an 8-character alphanumeric string, which matches the pattern described in the swagger definition.
2. **Example Analysis**: The provided examples show that the `hotelId` appears as a query parameter value in the `self` URL, specifically after `hotelIds=`.
3. **Number of Calls and Examples**: With 10,000 calls and 16,624 examples, including 14,204 distinct ones, the invariant held true without any counterexamples.
4. **Semantic Consistency**: The `hotelId` being part of the `self` URL as a query parameter is semantically consistent with how URLs are typically structured to include identifiers for resources.

### Conclusion
The invariant that `return.hotel.hotelId` is a substring of `return.self` is consistent with the observed data and the semantic structure of the API response. Given the large number of examples and the lack of counterexamples, it is highly likely that this invariant is a true-positive.

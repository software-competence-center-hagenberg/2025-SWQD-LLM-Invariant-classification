### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/shopping/hotel-offers`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameters**:
  - `hotelIds`: An array of Amadeus property codes, mandatory for searching by a predefined list of hotels.
- **Response**:
  - `data`: An array containing hotel offers.
  - Each offer contains `policies`.
  - `policies` include `deposit` information.
  - `deposit` has `acceptedPayments` which lists `methods` of payment.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[])-1 % size(input.hotelIds[]) == 0`
- **Type**: NumericInt$Divides
- **Description**: The size of the `acceptedPayments.methods` array minus one divides the size of the `hotelIds` array without remainder.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - `input.hotelIds[]`: Represents the list of hotel IDs provided in the request.
   - `return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]`: Represents the list of accepted payment methods for a hotel offer.
   - The invariant suggests a mathematical relationship between the number of hotel IDs and the number of accepted payment methods minus one.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 3 distinct examples were found where the invariant holds.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The invariant implies a specific relationship between the number of hotel IDs and the number of payment methods, which is not inherently logical or explained by the API specification.
   - The number of payment methods should logically depend on the hotel's policies, not the number of hotel IDs queried.

4. **Specification Check**:
   - The specification does not suggest any relationship between the number of hotel IDs and the number of payment methods.
   - The invariant seems to be coincidental rather than a rule enforced by the API.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of logical connection between the number of hotel IDs and the number of payment methods, and the absence of any specification support for such a relationship, the invariant is likely a **false-positive**. The empirical evidence of 100 calls without a counterexample is not sufficient to override the logical inconsistency.

**Confidence**: 0.6

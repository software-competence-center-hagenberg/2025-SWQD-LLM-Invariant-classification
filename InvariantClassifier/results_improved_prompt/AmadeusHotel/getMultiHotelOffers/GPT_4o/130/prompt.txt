Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    price:
                      type: object
                      description: price information
                      properties:
                        total:
                          type: string
                          description: total = base + totalTaxes


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.price.total is Numeric

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsNumeric
Invariant description: Indicates that the characters of a string variable are always numeric. Represented as x is Numeric.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 41891 examples in the requests data, with 14428 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.data.offers.price.total=123.61
return.data.offers.price.total=1598.40
return.data.offers.price.total=160.00
return.data.offers.price.total=3309.25
return.data.offers.price.total=364.62

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- **Endpoint**: `/shopping/hotel-offers`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameter**: `countryOfResidence` is a query parameter, described as a code of the country of residence of the traveler, expressed using ISO 3166-1 format. The pattern is `[A-Z]{2}`, indicating it is a two-letter country code.
- **Response**: The response contains a `data` array, where each item has a `self` property of type string.

### Invariant
- **Invariant**: `input.countryOfResidence` is a substring of `return.self`
- **Invariant Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString`
- **Description**: This invariant suggests that the `countryOfResidence` parameter appears as a substring within the `self` URL in the response.

### Analysis
- **Empirical Evidence**: Out of 10,000 calls, there were no counterexamples found, and 7,511 examples supported the invariant, with 6,457 distinct examples.
- **Example Analysis**: The examples provided show that the `countryOfResidence` value appears in the query string of the `self` URL, specifically as a parameter `countryOfResidence`.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Given the structure of the URL in the `self` field, it is logical that the `countryOfResidence` parameter from the request would be included in the URL as part of the query string. This is a common pattern in REST APIs where request parameters are echoed back in response URLs for traceability and debugging purposes.

### Conclusion
The invariant that `input.countryOfResidence` is a substring of `return.self` is consistent with the URL structure and the behavior of REST APIs. The high number of examples without any counterexamples strongly supports the validity of this invariant. Therefore, it is classified as a "true-positive" with high confidence.

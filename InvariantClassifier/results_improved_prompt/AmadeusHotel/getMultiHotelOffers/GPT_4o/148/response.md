### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes a REST API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` with a `GET` method. The response schema includes a `data` array, where each item is an object representing a hotel. Each hotel object contains a `dupeId` property, which is described as a "Unique Property identifier of the physical hotel." The description suggests that `dupeId` is used to group hotels that are the same but represented by different providers.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is that `return.hotel.dupeId` is Numeric. This means that the `dupeId` field in the response is always composed of numeric characters.

### Analysis

1. **Data Analysis**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true across a wide range of data.

2. **Distinct Examples**: Out of 8,829 examples, there are 220 distinct `dupeId` values, all of which are numeric. This further supports the invariant.

3. **Semantic Analysis**: The `dupeId` is described as a "Unique Property identifier," which often implies a numeric or alphanumeric format. However, the examples provided are all numeric, which aligns with the invariant.

4. **Specification**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `dupeId` must be numeric, but the lack of counterexamples and the nature of identifiers (often numeric) support the invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the extensive testing (10,000 calls) without any counterexamples, the high number of examples (8,829) with 220 distinct numeric values, and the typical use of numeric identifiers in similar contexts, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant is a "true-positive." The invariant is consistent with the observed data and does not contradict the provided specification.

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.base is Numeric

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsNumeric
Invariant description: Indicates that the characters of a string variable are always numeric. Represented as x is Numeric.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers.price.variations.changes" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 70797 examples in the requests data, with 5027 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.data.offers.price.variations.changes.base=184.89
return.data.offers.price.variations.changes.base=46190
return.data.offers.price.variations.changes.base=1180.00
return.data.offers.price.variations.changes.base=643.50

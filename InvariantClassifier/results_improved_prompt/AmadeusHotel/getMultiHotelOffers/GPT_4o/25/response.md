### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provides details about the `/shopping/hotel-offers` endpoint. The relevant part of the response schema is:

- **data**: An array of objects.
  - **offers**: An array of objects.
    - **room**: An object.
      - **typeEstimated**: An object with properties:
        - **beds**: An integer representing the number of beds in the room, with a description indicating it can range from 1 to 9.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

- **Invariant**: `return.room.typeEstimated.beds one of { 1, 2 }`
- **Invariant Type**: `daikon.inv.unary.scalar.OneOfScalar`

### Analysis

- **Swagger Specification**: The specification explicitly states that the number of beds (`beds`) can range from 1 to 9. This suggests that while 1 and 2 are valid values, they are not the only possible values according to the specification.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 50 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, only two distinct values (1 and 2) were observed in the 60 examples collected.
- **Possible Explanation**: The limited range of observed values could be due to the specific dataset or configurations used during testing, which might not cover all possible scenarios or room configurations.

### Conclusion

Given the specification allows for values between 1 and 9, the invariant `return.room.typeEstimated.beds one of { 1, 2 }` is too restrictive and does not align with the documented range. Therefore, it is likely a **false-positive**. The lack of counterexamples in the limited number of calls does not override the explicit range provided in the specification.

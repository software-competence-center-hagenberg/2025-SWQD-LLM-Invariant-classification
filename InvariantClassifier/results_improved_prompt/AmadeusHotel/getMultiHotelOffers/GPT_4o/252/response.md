### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` with a `GET` method. The response schema for a successful request (HTTP 200) includes a `data` property, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `commission` object, which has an `amount` property. This `amount` is described as a string and represents the commission paid to the travel seller, linked to the currency code of the offer.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.commission.amount one of { "1.78", "2.74" }`. This suggests that the `amount` field in the `commission` object of each offer can only take on the values "1.78" or "2.74".

### Analysis

1. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.

2. **Distinct Values**: Out of 173 examples, only two distinct values were observed, which are exactly the values specified in the invariant.

3. **Specification Ambiguity**: The Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the possible values of `amount`. It only describes it as a string linked to the currency code. This lack of explicit constraints in the specification means that the invariant could potentially be true if the API is designed to only return these specific commission amounts.

4. **Semantic Plausibility**: The invariant is semantically plausible if the API is designed to offer only a limited set of commission amounts for some business logic reasons.

### Conclusion

Given the strong empirical evidence from 10,000 calls without counterexamples and the lack of explicit contradictory information in the Swagger definition, the invariant is likely a "true-positive". However, the confidence is not absolute due to the absence of explicit constraints in the specification, which leaves room for potential future changes or untested scenarios.

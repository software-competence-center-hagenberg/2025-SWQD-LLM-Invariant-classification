### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- **Endpoint**: `/shopping/hotel-offers`
- **HTTP Method**: GET
- **Parameters**:
  - `hotelIds`: An array of Amadeus property codes, each 8 characters long, required for the request.
- **Response**:
  - **200 OK**: Returns an object containing a `data` array. Each item in `data` has an `offers` array, and each offer has a `policies` object with a `cancellation` object. The `cancellation` object includes a `numberOfNights` integer.

### Invariant
- **Invariant**: `return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights != size(input.hotelIds[])`
- **Invariant Type**: Binary invariant asserting inequality between two integer values.

### Analysis
- **Semantic Context**: The `hotelIds` parameter is a list of hotel identifiers, while `numberOfNights` is a cancellation policy detail indicating the number of nights charged as a fee if a booking is canceled.
- **Logical Relationship**: There is no inherent logical relationship between the number of hotel IDs in the request and the number of nights charged as a cancellation fee. These two values are conceptually unrelated; one pertains to the input query and the other to a specific policy detail of a hotel offer.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, the lack of counterexamples does not imply a logical connection between these two fields.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights != size(input.hotelIds[])` is likely a **false-positive**. The two fields compared in the invariant are semantically unrelated, and the invariant's correctness is not supported by any logical or documented relationship in the API specification. The absence of counterexamples in 100 calls is not sufficient to establish this invariant as a true-positive, given the lack of a conceptual link between the fields.

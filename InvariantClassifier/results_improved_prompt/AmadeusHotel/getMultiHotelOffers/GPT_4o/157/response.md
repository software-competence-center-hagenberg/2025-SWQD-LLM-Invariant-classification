### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides a `GET` method to retrieve hotel offers. One of the query parameters is `lang`, which specifies the requested language for descriptive texts. The language code follows the ISO 639 standard and can be between 2 to 5 characters long. If the requested language is unavailable, the text defaults to English. The response schema includes a `data` array, where each item has a `self` property of type string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.lang` is a substring of `return.self`. This implies that the language code specified in the request is expected to appear somewhere within the `self` URL string in the response.

### Analysis
- **Pattern Matching**: The `lang` parameter is included in the query string of the `self` URL, as evidenced by the example values provided. This suggests that the language code is consistently appended to the URL, making it a substring of `self`.
- **Number of Calls and Examples**: With 10,000 calls and 9,628 examples supporting the invariant, it is highly likely that this pattern is consistently followed.
- **Semantic Consistency**: Including the `lang` parameter in the URL is a common practice for APIs to indicate the language preference for the response, which aligns with the invariant.
- **Specification Alignment**: The specification does not mention any other behavior for the `lang` parameter that would contradict the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the consistent inclusion of `lang` in the `self` URL across a large number of examples and the lack of any specification details that contradict this behavior, the invariant is very likely a "true-positive". The invariant makes semantic sense and aligns with typical API design patterns.

**Confidence**: 0.95

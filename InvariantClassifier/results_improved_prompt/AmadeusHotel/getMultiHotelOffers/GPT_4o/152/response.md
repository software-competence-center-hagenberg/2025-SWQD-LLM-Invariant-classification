### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides a GET method to retrieve hotel offers. One of the query parameters is `checkOutDate`, which is a string formatted as a date (YYYY-MM-DD). The specification states that the lowest accepted value for `checkOutDate` is `checkInDate + 1`, and if not provided, it defaults to `checkInDate + 1`.

The response schema includes an object with a property `data`, which is an array of items. Each item has a property `self` of type string.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `input.checkOutDate` is a substring of `return.self`.

### Analysis
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.
- **Distinct Examples**: Out of 9,386 examples, 8,042 are distinct, indicating a wide variety of test cases.
- **Example Analysis**: The examples provided show that `checkOutDate` appears as a query parameter in the `self` URL, which is consistent with the invariant.
- **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not explicitly mention the format of the `self` URL, but the examples suggest that `checkOutDate` is included in the URL, making it plausible for `checkOutDate` to be a substring of `self`.

### Conclusion
Given the large number of examples and the absence of counterexamples, along with the logical consistency of the invariant with the observed data, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant makes sense given the context of the API, where `checkOutDate` is likely included as a query parameter in the `self` URL.

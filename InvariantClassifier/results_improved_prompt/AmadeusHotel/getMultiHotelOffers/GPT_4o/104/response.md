### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides a GET operation named `getMultiHotelOffers`. The response schema for a successful request (HTTP 200) includes a `data` array. Each item in this array represents a `hotel` object, which contains properties `latitude` and `longitude`, both of which are numbers.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.hotel.latitude != return.hotel.longitude`. This invariant suggests that for every hotel object returned in the response, the latitude is not equal to the longitude.

### Analysis
- **Semantic Meaning**: Latitude and longitude are geographical coordinates that represent different dimensions of a location on the Earth's surface. By definition, latitude measures the distance north or south of the equator, while longitude measures the distance east or west of the prime meridian. It is highly unlikely for these two values to be equal for any given location, as they represent fundamentally different axes.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls to the API, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 16,624 examples were observed, with 259 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.
- **Specification Consistency**: The Swagger definition does not provide any constraints or scenarios where latitude and longitude could be equal. Given the nature of these geographical coordinates, the invariant aligns with the expected behavior of the API.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.hotel.latitude != return.hotel.longitude` is consistent with the semantic meaning of latitude and longitude as geographical coordinates. The extensive testing without any counterexamples further supports its validity. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a "true-positive" with high confidence.

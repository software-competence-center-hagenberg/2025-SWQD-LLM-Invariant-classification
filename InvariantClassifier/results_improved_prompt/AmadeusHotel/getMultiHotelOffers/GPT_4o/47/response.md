### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides hotel offers, and the response includes a `data` array. Each item in this array contains `offers`, which further include `policies`. The `policies` object has a `cancellation` property, which itself is an object containing a `description`. The `description` has a `text` field, which is a string and can contain free text.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: "`return.policies.cancellation.description.text` one of { "NON-REFUNDABLE RATE", "Plus Taxes and fees where appropriate." }". This invariant suggests that the `text` field within the `cancellation.description` object only takes on one of these two values.

### Analysis

1. **Number of Calls and Examples:**
   - We have made 100 calls to the API without encountering a counterexample to the invariant.
   - There are 63 examples in the request data, with only 2 distinct values observed for the `text` field.

2. **Semantic Analysis:**
   - The `text` field is described as "Free Text", which implies it could potentially take on a wide range of values. However, the examples provided are specific phrases related to cancellation policies.
   - The invariant suggests that only two specific phrases are used in practice, at least within the scope of the tested calls.

3. **Specification and Context:**
   - The specification does not explicitly limit the `text` field to these two values, but it also does not provide any other examples or suggest a broader range of values.
   - The invariant could be a result of specific business rules or common practices in the data returned by this API.

### Conclusion

Given the number of calls and the lack of counterexamples, along with the fact that the invariant aligns with the observed data, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a "true-positive". However, the confidence is slightly tempered by the potential for other values to exist outside the tested scenarios.

**Verdict:** True-positive

**Confidence:** 0.8

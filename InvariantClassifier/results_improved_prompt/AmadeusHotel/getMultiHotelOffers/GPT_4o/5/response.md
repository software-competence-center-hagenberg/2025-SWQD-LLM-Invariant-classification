### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` is designed to retrieve hotel offers. It requires a query parameter `adults`, which specifies the number of adult guests per room, with a valid range from 1 to 9. The response includes a `data` array, where each item contains an `offers` array. Each offer has a `policies` object, which includes a `deposit` object. This `deposit` object contains `acceptedPayments`, which is an object listing `methods`—an array of strings representing accepted payment methods.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`input.adults == size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[])`

This invariant suggests that the number of adults specified in the request is equal to the number of accepted payment methods returned in the response.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Relevance**: The number of adults (`input.adults`) and the number of accepted payment methods (`return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]`) are semantically unrelated. The number of adults typically affects room capacity or pricing, not the number of payment methods.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not indicate any relationship between the number of adults and the number of payment methods. The `adults` parameter is strictly about the number of guests, while `acceptedPayments.methods` is about how payments can be made.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 50 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, only 2 distinct examples were observed, which is a very small sample size. The examples provided do not inherently suggest a logical connection between the two variables.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic irrelevance between the number of adults and the number of payment methods, and the lack of specification support for such a relationship, this invariant is likely a coincidence in the small sample size tested. Therefore, it is classified as a "false-positive."

**Confidence**: 0.8, due to the clear semantic disconnect and lack of specification support, despite the absence of counterexamples in a limited sample size.

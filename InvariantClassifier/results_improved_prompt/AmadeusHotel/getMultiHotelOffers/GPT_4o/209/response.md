### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes an endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` with a GET method. The response schema includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`. Each offer has a `room` object, which includes a `typeEstimated` object. This `typeEstimated` object has a `beds` property, which is an integer representing the number of beds in the room. The description specifies that the number of beds ranges from 1 to 9.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.room.typeEstimated.beds >= 1`. This invariant suggests that the number of beds in the room is always greater than or equal to 1.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The Swagger definition explicitly states that the `beds` property is an integer with a range from 1 to 9. This directly supports the invariant that the number of beds is always at least 1.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 36,673 examples were observed, with 7 distinct values, all of which are greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Logical Consistency**: The invariant logically aligns with the description provided in the Swagger definition, which specifies a minimum of 1 bed.

### Conclusion

Given the explicit range provided in the Swagger definition and the extensive empirical evidence supporting the invariant, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant is consistent with the documented API behavior and has been thoroughly tested without any counterexamples.

**Verdict**: True-positive

**Confidence**: 1.0

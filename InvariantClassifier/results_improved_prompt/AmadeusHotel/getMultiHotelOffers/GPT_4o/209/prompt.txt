paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:

    parameters:
    responses:

            data:

                      properties:
                        typeEstimated:
                          type: object
                          description: estimated room category, bed type and number of beds in the room. This information has been parsed from the room description, and is thus only provided for informational purposes
                          properties:
                            beds:
                              type: integer
                              description: Number of beds in the room (1-9)


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.room.typeEstimated.beds >= 1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.LowerBound
Invariant description: Represents the invariant x >= c, where c is a constant and x is a long scalar.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 36673 examples in the requests data, with 7 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds=1
return.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds=2
return.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds=3
return.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds=4
return.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds=5

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The swagger definition provides information about the `/shopping/hotel-offers` endpoint. The response schema includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`, and each offer has a `boardType` field. The `boardType` is a string that can take on one of several enumerated values, such as `ROOM_ONLY`, `BREAKFAST`, `HALF_BOARD`, etc.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.boardType)==9`, which suggests that the `boardType` string always has a fixed length of 9 characters.

### Analysis

- **Enumerated Values:** The `boardType` field can take on a variety of values as specified in the enum list. These values include strings of varying lengths, such as `ROOM_ONLY` (8 characters), `BREAKFAST` (9 characters), `HALF_BOARD` (10 characters), and others.
- **Examples Provided:** The examples provided are `ROOM_ONLY` (8 characters) and `BREAKFAST` (9 characters). While `BREAKFAST` fits the invariant, `ROOM_ONLY` does not, as it is only 8 characters long.
- **Number of Calls and Examples:** Despite 100 calls and 123 examples, only 2 distinct examples were found, which is a very limited sample size given the number of possible enum values.

### Conclusion

Given the enumerated values for `boardType`, it is clear that not all possible values have a length of 9 characters. The invariant `LENGTH(return.boardType)==9` is contradicted by the possible values specified in the swagger definition, such as `ROOM_ONLY` and `HALF_BOARD`. Therefore, this invariant is a **false-positive**.

### Confidence

The confidence in this classification is very high (0.95) because the swagger definition explicitly lists values that contradict the invariant.

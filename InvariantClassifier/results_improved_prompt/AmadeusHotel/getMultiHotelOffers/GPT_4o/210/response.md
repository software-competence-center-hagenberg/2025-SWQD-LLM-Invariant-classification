### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` is designed to retrieve hotel offers. The response schema includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`. Each offer can have `policies`, and within `policies`, there is a `cancellation` object. The `cancellation` object has a property `numberOfNights`, which is an integer representing the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights >= 1`. This invariant suggests that the `numberOfNights` field in the `cancellation` policy of an offer is always greater than or equal to 1.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `numberOfNights` represents a fee in terms of nights charged if a booking is canceled. It is reasonable to assume that a cancellation policy would charge at least one night as a fee, as charging zero nights would imply no penalty, which is uncommon for cancellation policies.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 4,474 examples were observed, with 9 distinct values, all of which were greater than or equal to 1. This strong empirical evidence supports the invariant.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The swagger definition does not specify any minimum or maximum values for `numberOfNights`, but the description implies it is a fee, which aligns with the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic reasoning that cancellation policies typically involve a penalty of at least one night, the lack of counterexamples in a large number of tests, and the alignment with the swagger definition, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant makes logical sense in the context of hotel booking cancellation policies.

**Verdict**: true-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides a GET method to retrieve hotel offers. The response schema includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`. Each offer has a `price` object, which includes `taxes`. Each tax has a `percentage` field, which is a string.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.percentage)==5`, which suggests that the `percentage` field in the response always has a fixed length of 5 characters.

### Analysis
1. **Data Type and Examples**: The `percentage` field is defined as a string. The examples provided (`20.00`, `17.70`, `16.00`, `12.50`, `10.00`) all have a length of 5 characters, which supports the invariant.

2. **Number of Calls and Examples**: The invariant was tested over 50 calls without finding a counterexample. There are 23 examples with 5 distinct values, all adhering to the invariant.

3. **Semantic Consideration**: The `percentage` field represents a tax percentage, which is typically expressed as a decimal number with two decimal places. This format naturally results in a string of length 5 (e.g., `XX.XX`).

4. **Specification and Context**: The specification does not explicitly mention other formats or lengths for the `percentage` field. Given the context of tax percentages, it is reasonable to expect a consistent format.

### Conclusion
The invariant `LENGTH(return.percentage)==5` is likely a "true-positive" because:
- All observed examples conform to the invariant.
- The semantic context of tax percentages supports a fixed length format.
- The specification does not contradict this invariant.

Given these points, the invariant is classified as a "true-positive" with high confidence.

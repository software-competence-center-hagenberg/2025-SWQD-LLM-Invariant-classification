### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a `data` array. Each item in this array has a `type` field, which is a string, and a `self` field, which is also a string. The `type` field is described as "the type of the object (hotel-offers)".

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.data.type` is a substring of `return.data.self`.

### Analysis
1. **Data Type and Structure**: The `type` field is a string that is expected to have the value "hotel-offers" based on the description. The `self` field is a URL string.
2. **Example Values**: The examples provided show that `return.data.type` is consistently "hotel-offers" and `return.data.self` is a URL that includes the substring "hotel-offers".
3. **Number of Calls and Examples**: With 10,000 calls made and 16,624 examples found, of which 14,204 are distinct, the invariant held true in all cases.
4. **Semantic Analysis**: The `self` field is a URL that likely includes the endpoint path, which contains "hotel-offers". This suggests that the invariant is not only a coincidence but a result of the API's design.

### Conclusion
Given the consistent presence of "hotel-offers" in the `self` URL across a large number of examples and the semantic expectation that the `self` URL would include the endpoint path, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the expected structure of the API response, and the extensive testing without counterexamples further supports this conclusion.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes a REST API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` with a `GET` method. The response for a successful request (HTTP status code 200) is an object containing a property `data`, which is an array. Each element of this array contains `offers`, which is also an array. Each element of `offers` includes a `price` object that holds price information.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.price != null`. This invariant suggests that for every offer in the `offers` array within the `data` array of the response, the `price` object is not null.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Definition**: The Swagger definition specifies that `price` is an object and is part of the `offers` array. There is no explicit mention of `price` being optional or nullable, which suggests that it is expected to be present in each offer.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls to the API, and no counterexamples were found. This is a strong empirical indication that the invariant holds true across a wide range of scenarios.

3. **Semantic Consideration**: In the context of hotel offers, it is logical to assume that each offer would have associated price information. An offer without a price would be incomplete and likely not useful to consumers.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of evidence to the contrary after extensive testing (10,000 calls) and the logical expectation that a hotel offer would include price information, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant `return.price != null` is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of the API as described in the Swagger definition and supported by empirical data.

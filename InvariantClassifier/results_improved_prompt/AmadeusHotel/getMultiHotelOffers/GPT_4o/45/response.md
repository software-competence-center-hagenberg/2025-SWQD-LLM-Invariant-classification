### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes a REST API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` with a `GET` method. The response schema for a successful request (HTTP 200) is an object that contains a `data` property, which is an array of hotel offers. Each offer contains a `policies` object, which includes a `cancellation` object. The `cancellation` object has a `type` property that is described as a string and can take on the value `FULL_STAY`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `return.policies.cancellation.type == "FULL_STAY"`.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The Swagger definition explicitly states that the `type` property of the `cancellation` object has an enum with a single value: `FULL_STAY`. This suggests that the only valid value for `type` is `FULL_STAY`.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls to the API, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there were 2,886 examples of the invariant holding true, with only one distinct value observed (`FULL_STAY`).

3. **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant aligns with the semantic description provided in the Swagger definition, which only lists `FULL_STAY` as a valid value for the `type` property.

### Conclusion

Given the Swagger definition explicitly restricts the `type` to `FULL_STAY` and the empirical evidence supports this with a large number of examples and no counterexamples, the invariant is highly likely to be a "true-positive". The invariant is consistent with the API's specification and observed behavior.

**Verdict**: true-positive

**Confidence**: 1.0 (very high confidence)

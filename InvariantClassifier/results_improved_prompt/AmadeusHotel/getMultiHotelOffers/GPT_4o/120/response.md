### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` with a `GET` method. The response for a successful request (HTTP 200) includes a JSON object with a `data` property, which is an array. Each item in this array contains an `offers` array, and each offer has a `roomQuantity` property. The `roomQuantity` is defined as a string, with a description indicating it represents the number of rooms, ranging from 1 to 9.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.roomQuantity)==1`, which suggests that the `roomQuantity` string always has a length of 1.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Definition:** The `roomQuantity` is described as a string representing numbers from 1 to 9. All these numbers are single-digit numbers, which means their string representation will indeed have a length of 1.

2. **Empirical Evidence:** The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 13,857 examples were observed, with 8 distinct values, all of which are single-digit numbers (e.g., '6', '7', '8', '9', '2').

3. **Logical Consistency:** Given the description that `roomQuantity` represents a number of rooms between 1 and 9, it is logically consistent that the string length is always 1, as these are all single-digit numbers.

### Conclusion

The invariant `LENGTH(return.roomQuantity)==1` is consistent with both the Swagger definition and the observed data. Since the `roomQuantity` is defined to represent numbers 1 through 9, it is reasonable to conclude that its string representation will always be a single character long. Therefore, this invariant is a **true-positive** with high confidence.

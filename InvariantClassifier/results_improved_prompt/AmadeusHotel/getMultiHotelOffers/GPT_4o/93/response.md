### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides hotel offers with detailed pricing and policy information. The response schema includes:
- `data`: An array containing `offers`.
  - `offers`: Each offer includes:
    - `price`: An object with `variations`.
      - `variations`: Contains `changes`, an array of price periods with details like `startDate`, `endDate`, `currency`, `sellingTotal`, etc.
    - `policies`: An object with `guarantee`.
      - `guarantee`: Contains `acceptedPayments`.
        - `acceptedPayments`: Includes `creditCards`, an array of accepted credit card types.

### Invariant

The invariant states that the number of price variation changes (`size(return.price.variations.changes[]) - 1`) is less than or equal to the number of accepted credit card types (`size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]) - 1`).

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `changes` array represents periods of price variation during a stay, which can vary independently of the number of accepted credit card types.
   - The `creditCards` array represents the types of credit cards accepted for payment, which is related to payment policies rather than pricing periods.

2. **Statistical Evidence**:
   - 100 API calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 138 examples were found, with 65 distinct examples supporting the invariant.

3. **Logical Consistency**:
   - There is no logical or semantic reason why the number of price variation periods should be related to the number of accepted credit card types. These are two independent aspects of an offer.

### Conclusion

Despite the statistical evidence supporting the invariant, the lack of semantic connection between the two fields suggests that this invariant is coincidental rather than a true relationship. The invariant is likely a "false-positive" because it does not make logical sense for the number of price variation periods to be constrained by the number of accepted credit card types. The invariant's validity in the observed cases is likely due to the specific data distribution rather than a fundamental rule of the API.

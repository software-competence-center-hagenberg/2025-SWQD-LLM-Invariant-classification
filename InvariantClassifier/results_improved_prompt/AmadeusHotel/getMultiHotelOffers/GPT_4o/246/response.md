### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` returns a list of hotel offers. Each offer includes a `policies` object, which contains a `deposit` object. The `deposit` object has an `acceptedPayments` object, which includes two arrays: `creditCards` and `methods`. The `creditCards` array lists the accepted payment card types, while the `methods` array lists the accepted payment methods, including `CREDIT_CARD` among others.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is:

`size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]) - 1 > size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[])`

This invariant suggests that the number of accepted credit card types minus one is greater than the number of accepted payment methods.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Definition**: The `methods` array can contain multiple payment methods, but in the examples provided, it only contains `CREDIT_CARD`. The `creditCards` array lists specific card types, which are more granular than the payment methods.
2. **Examples**: All provided examples show that the `methods` array contains only one element, `CREDIT_CARD`, while the `creditCards` array contains multiple elements. This supports the invariant.
3. **Number of Calls**: The invariant held true across 10,000 calls, with 1,307 examples and 11 distinct examples, indicating a strong pattern.
4. **Semantic Reasoning**: The invariant makes sense semantically because the `creditCards` array is a subset of the `methods` array when `methods` includes `CREDIT_CARD`. Therefore, it is logical for the `creditCards` array to have more elements than the `methods` array.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic reasoning, the number of calls, and the examples provided, the invariant appears to be a true-positive. The invariant logically follows from the structure of the response, where the `creditCards` array is expected to have more elements than the `methods` array when `methods` includes `CREDIT_CARD`. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is correct.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition provides information about the `/shopping/hotel-offers` endpoint. The response schema includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`. Each offer has a `roomQuantity` property, which is defined as a string. The description specifies that this string represents the number of rooms, with valid values ranging from 1 to 9.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.roomQuantity is Numeric`, which suggests that the `roomQuantity` field in the response is always composed of numeric characters.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Definition**: The `roomQuantity` is defined as a string, but the description and example indicate that it represents a numeric value (number of rooms from 1 to 9).
2. **Test Results**: Out of 10,000 calls, no counterexamples were found, and 13,857 examples confirmed the invariant, with 8 distinct numeric values observed.
3. **Semantic Consistency**: The description explicitly mentions that `roomQuantity` is a number between 1 and 9, which aligns with the invariant that it is numeric. The fact that it is stored as a string does not contradict the invariant, as the numeric values are still represented as strings.

### Conclusion
Given the description in the Swagger definition and the extensive testing results, the invariant that `roomQuantity` is numeric is consistent with the API's intended behavior. The invariant is likely a true-positive because the values are expected to be numeric, even though they are represented as strings. The lack of counterexamples across a large number of calls further supports this conclusion.

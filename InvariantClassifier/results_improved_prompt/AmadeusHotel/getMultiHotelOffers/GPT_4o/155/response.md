### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- **Endpoint**: `/shopping/hotel-offers`
- **HTTP Method**: GET
- **Parameter**: `paymentPolicy` (query parameter)
  - **Description**: Filters the response based on a specific payment type. Default is `NONE`.
  - **Type**: string
- **Response**: 200 OK
  - **Schema**: Object containing a `data` array
    - **Items**: Each item has a `self` field of type string

### Invariant
- **Invariant**: `input.paymentPolicy` is a substring of `return.self`
- **Invariant Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString`
- **Description**: Represents the substring invariant between two String scalars.

### Analysis
- **Empirical Evidence**: 
  - 10,000 API calls were made without finding a counterexample.
  - 7,342 examples were found, with 6,329 being distinct.
  - Example values show `input.paymentPolicy` as a substring in the `return.self` URL.
- **Semantic Analysis**:
  - The `self` field in the response appears to be a URL that includes query parameters.
  - The `paymentPolicy` parameter is included in the URL as a query parameter, making it a substring of the `self` URL.
- **Specification Consistency**:
  - The specification does not mention any other behavior for `paymentPolicy` that would contradict the invariant.
  - The invariant logically follows from the structure of the URL in the response.

### Conclusion
Given the empirical evidence and the logical consistency with the API's behavior, the invariant that `input.paymentPolicy` is a substring of `return.self` is highly likely to be a **true-positive**. The invariant is consistent with the URL construction in the response, and no counterexamples were found in a significant number of API calls.

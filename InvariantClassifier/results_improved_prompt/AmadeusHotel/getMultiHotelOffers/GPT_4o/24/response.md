### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides a `GET` operation to retrieve hotel offers. The response schema includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`. Each offer has a `room` object, which includes a `typeEstimated` property. This property is described as an "estimated room category, bed type and number of beds in the room," and is noted to be parsed from the room description for informational purposes.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.room.typeEstimated != null`. This implies that for every response received from the API, the `typeEstimated` field within each `room` object in the `offers` array should not be null.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The `typeEstimated` field is described as an estimated value derived from the room description. This suggests that it is expected to be present in most cases, as it provides additional information about the room.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 100 calls to the API, and no counterexamples were found, indicating that the `typeEstimated` field was always present in the responses received during testing.

3. **Specification Considerations**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `typeEstimated` can be null. However, it is described as "informational," which might imply that it could be omitted if the information cannot be parsed or is unavailable.

### Conclusion

Given the empirical evidence from 100 calls without counterexamples and the semantic expectation that `typeEstimated` should generally be present, the invariant seems likely to be a "true-positive." However, the confidence is slightly tempered by the fact that the field is described as informational, which could imply potential nullability in edge cases not covered by the tests.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` which returns a list of hotel offers. Each offer includes a `boardType` field, which is a string that can take on a variety of values as specified by the `enum` list. The possible values for `boardType` include:
- ROOM_ONLY
- BREAKFAST
- HALF_BOARD
- FULL_BOARD
- ALL_INCLUSIVE
- BUFFET_BREAKFAST
- CARIBBEAN_BREAKFAST
- CONTINENTAL_BREAKFAST
- ENGLISH_BREAKFAST
- FULL_BREAKFAST
- DINNER_BED_AND_BREAKFAST
- LUNCH
- DINNER
- FAMILY_PLAN
- AS_BROCHURED
- SELF_CATERING
- BERMUDA
- AMERICAN
- FAMILY_AMERICAN
- MODIFIED

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.boardType one of { "BREAKFAST", "ROOM_ONLY" }`.

### Analysis
- **Swagger Enum Values**: The `boardType` field can take on a wide range of values as per the Swagger definition. The invariant only includes two of these possible values (`BREAKFAST` and `ROOM_ONLY`).
- **Observed Data**: In 100 calls, only `BREAKFAST` and `ROOM_ONLY` were observed as values for `boardType`. However, this is a small sample size relative to the number of possible values.
- **Possible Values**: The specification explicitly lists many other possible values for `boardType` that were not observed in the sample data. This suggests that the invariant is not capturing the full range of potential values.

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition explicitly allows for many more values than those observed, the invariant is likely a "false-positive". The observed data is not sufficient to conclude that only `BREAKFAST` and `ROOM_ONLY` are valid values for `boardType`, especially considering the small sample size and the broad range of values specified in the API documentation.

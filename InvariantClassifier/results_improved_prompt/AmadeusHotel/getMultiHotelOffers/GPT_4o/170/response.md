### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/shopping/hotel-offers`
- **Operation**: `GET`
- **Parameter**: `adults` (integer, required, range 1-9)
- **Response**: Contains a `data` array with `offers`, each having `policies` which include `deposit` information. The `deposit` has `acceptedPayments` with `methods` as an array of strings representing payment methods.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.adults % size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0`
- **Type**: NumericInt$Divides
- **Description**: The number of adults divides the size of the accepted payment methods array without a remainder.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `adults` parameter represents the number of adult guests per room, ranging from 1 to 9.
   - The `acceptedPayments.methods` is an array of strings representing different payment methods accepted for a hotel offer.
   - There is no direct semantic relationship between the number of adults and the number of accepted payment methods. The number of adults is related to room occupancy, while payment methods are related to financial transactions.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - The invariant was tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found.
   - There are 3 distinct examples where the invariant holds:
     - `input.adults=1` with 1 payment method.
     - `input.adults=2` with 2 payment methods.
     - `input.adults=2` with 1 payment method.
   - However, the invariant holding in these examples does not imply a causal relationship due to the lack of semantic connection.

3. **Specification Review**:
   - The specification does not mention any relationship between the number of adults and the number of payment methods.
   - The invariant seems coincidental based on the examples rather than a rule enforced by the API.

### Conclusion

The invariant `input.adults % size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0` appears to be a coincidence rather than a true invariant. There is no semantic or specification-based reason to expect the number of adults to divide the number of payment methods without remainder. Thus, it is likely a **false-positive**.

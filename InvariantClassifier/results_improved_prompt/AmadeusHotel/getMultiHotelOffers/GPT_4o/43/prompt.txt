                                    maxLength: 2
                                    pattern: ^[A-Z]{2}$


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.policies.prepay.acceptedPayments.creditCards == null

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.OneOfScalar
Invariant description: Represents long variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition provided describes a REST API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` which returns a response with a schema that includes a `data` array. Each item in this array contains `offers`, which further includes `policies`. Within `policies`, there is a `cancellation` object that has a `description` property. This `description` has a `lang` property, which is a string and is described as conforming to RFC 5646, with an example value of `fr-FR`.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.policies.cancellation.description.lang == "EN"`.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Specification**: The `lang` property is specified to be a string that follows RFC 5646, which is a standard for language tags. The example given in the Swagger documentation is `fr-FR`, which indicates that the API is expected to handle multiple language codes, not just `EN`.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, only 119 examples were observed, with all of them having the `lang` value as `EN`.

3. **Semantic Consideration**: Given that the `lang` property is meant to represent language codes, it is semantically reasonable to expect a variety of language codes to be valid, especially since the example provided in the Swagger documentation (`fr-FR`) differs from `EN`.

4. **Potential for False Positives**: The fact that the Swagger documentation provides an example of `fr-FR` suggests that other language codes are valid and expected. The lack of diversity in the observed examples could be due to the specific dataset or configuration used during testing, rather than a true reflection of the API's capabilities.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.policies.cancellation.description.lang == "EN"` is likely a **false-positive**. The Swagger documentation explicitly suggests that multiple language codes are possible, and the lack of observed diversity in the test cases does not conclusively prove that `EN` is the only valid value. The invariant is likely an artifact of the specific test setup rather than a true constraint of the API.

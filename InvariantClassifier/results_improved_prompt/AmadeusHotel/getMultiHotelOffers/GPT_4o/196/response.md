### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides hotel offers, with each offer containing price information and booking policies. The relevant parts of the response schema are:
- `price.variations.changes[]`: An array representing periods where the daily price changes during the stay. Each entry includes `startDate`, `endDate`, `currency`, `sellingTotal`, `total`, `base`, and `markups`.
- `policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]`: An array of accepted credit card types, each represented by a two-letter string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `creditCards` array minus one divides evenly into the size of the `changes` array.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Relevance**: The invariant connects two unrelated aspects of the hotel offer: the number of accepted credit card types and the number of price change periods. There is no obvious semantic relationship between these two quantities.
2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not suggest any dependency or correlation between the number of credit card types and the number of price change periods.
3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, only 5 examples were observed, with 3 being distinct.
4. **Statistical Significance**: The limited number of distinct examples and the lack of a semantic link suggest that the invariant might be coincidental rather than a true property of the API.

### Conclusion
The invariant seems to be a statistical anomaly rather than a true property of the API. The lack of semantic connection between the two fields and the limited number of examples lead to the conclusion that this invariant is a "false-positive".

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` is used to retrieve hotel offers based on a list of hotel IDs. The `hotelIds` parameter is mandatory and is an array of strings, each representing an Amadeus property code. The response includes a `data` array, where each item contains `offers`, and each offer has `policies` with a `deposit` object. This `deposit` object includes `acceptedPayments`, which is an array of `methods` that are strings representing different payment methods.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`size(input.hotelIds[])-1 % size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0`

This invariant suggests that the number of hotel IDs minus one should be divisible by the number of accepted payment methods without a remainder.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant attempts to establish a mathematical relationship between the number of hotel IDs and the number of accepted payment methods. However, there is no semantic or logical connection between these two quantities. The number of hotel IDs is related to the hotels being queried, while the accepted payment methods are related to the payment options available for a particular offer.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not imply any relationship between the number of hotel IDs and the number of payment methods. The `hotelIds` parameter is used to filter the hotels, while `acceptedPayments.methods` is a property of the offers returned and is independent of the number of hotel IDs.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: Although 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample, only 3 distinct examples were found. This is a small sample size, and the lack of counterexamples does not necessarily confirm the invariant, especially given the lack of logical connection.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic connection between the number of hotel IDs and the number of accepted payment methods, and the absence of any indication in the specification that such a relationship should exist, this invariant is likely a coincidence based on the limited data set. Therefore, it is classified as a "false-positive."

**Confidence**: 0.7, due to the lack of logical connection and small sample size.

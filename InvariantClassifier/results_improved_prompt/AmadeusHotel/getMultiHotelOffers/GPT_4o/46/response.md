### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` which returns a response containing a list of hotel offers. Each offer can have a set of policies, including a cancellation policy. The cancellation policy includes a property `numberOfNights`, which is an integer representing the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is that `return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights` is one of {1, 3}.

### Analysis

1. **Data and Examples**: The invariant is based on 100 calls to the API, with 43 examples found, 2 of which are distinct. The distinct values observed are 1 and 3.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not explicitly restrict `numberOfNights` to the values 1 or 3. It simply states that it is an integer representing the number of nights due as a fee.

3. **Possible Values**: The invariant suggests that the only possible values for `numberOfNights` are 1 and 3. However, the specification does not limit this property to these values, and it is plausible that other values could be valid depending on the hotel's cancellation policy.

4. **Semantic Consideration**: The `numberOfNights` field is semantically meant to represent a fee in terms of nights. Different hotels might have different policies, and it is reasonable to expect that this number could vary beyond the observed values.

### Conclusion

Given that the specification does not limit `numberOfNights` to 1 or 3, and considering the semantic flexibility of hotel cancellation policies, it is likely that other values could be valid. The invariant is based on a limited set of observations and does not account for the potential variability in real-world data.

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a "false-positive" since it is unlikely to hold for every valid request on the API.

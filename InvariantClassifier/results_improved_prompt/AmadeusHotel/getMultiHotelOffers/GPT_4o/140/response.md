### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` is designed to retrieve hotel offers. It accepts a query parameter `lang`, which specifies the requested language for descriptive texts. The `lang` parameter follows the ISO language code format and can be between 2 to 5 characters long. If the requested language is not available, the text defaults to English. The response includes a `self` link for each offer, which is a URL that can be used to refresh the offer price.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is that `input.lang` is a substring of `return.data.offers.self`. This suggests that the language code provided in the request is included in the `self` URL of the response.

### Analysis

- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there were 24,499 examples supporting the invariant, with 21,608 being distinct.
- **Example Values**: The provided examples show that the `lang` parameter from the request is indeed present in the `self` URL of the response, typically as a query parameter (e.g., `?lang=IT`).
- **Specification Alignment**: The swagger definition does not explicitly mention that the `lang` parameter will appear in the `self` URL. However, given the examples and the pattern observed, it seems plausible that the API is designed to include the language code in the URL for purposes such as refreshing the offer with the same language setting.

### Conclusion

The invariant appears to be a "true-positive" based on the extensive empirical evidence and the logical consistency of including the language code in the `self` URL. While the swagger definition does not explicitly state this behavior, the observed data strongly supports the invariant. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant holds true for the API.

Confidence in this classification is high due to the large number of examples and the absence of counterexamples.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provides a description of the `/shopping/hotel-offers` endpoint. The response schema includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`. Each offer has a `rateFamilyEstimated` object, which includes a `type` property. The `type` property is described as a string that indicates the type of rate, with possible values being "public=P", "negotiated=N", and "conditional=C". The pattern `[PNC]` suggests that the `type` can be one of these three characters.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: "`return.rateFamilyEstimated.type` one of { "C", "P" }". This implies that the `type` field in the response is expected to only have the values "C" or "P".

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The Swagger definition explicitly mentions three possible values for the `type`: "P", "N", and "C". This suggests that "N" (negotiated) is a valid value for the `type` field.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: Despite 10,000 API calls, no instance of the `type` being "N" was observed. However, the presence of "N" in the Swagger definition indicates that it is a valid possibility, even if it was not encountered in the sampled data.

3. **Distinct Examples**: The invariant was derived from 25,855 examples, with only two distinct values observed: "C" and "P". This suggests that while "N" is a valid option, it might be less common or contextually dependent.

### Conclusion

Given the explicit mention of "N" as a possible value in the Swagger definition, the invariant "`return.rateFamilyEstimated.type` one of { "C", "P" }" is likely a **false-positive**. The absence of "N" in the observed data does not negate its validity as per the API specification. Therefore, the invariant does not hold universally across all valid requests, as it excludes a specified valid value.

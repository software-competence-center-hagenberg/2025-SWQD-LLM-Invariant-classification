Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object

            data:
              type: array

                            amount:
                              type: string
                              description: Defines amount with decimal separator.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.amount is Numeric

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsNumeric
Invariant description: Indicates that the characters of a string variable are always numeric. Represented as x is Numeric.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers.price.taxes" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 20282 examples in the requests data, with 4546 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.data.offers.price.taxes.amount=507.15
return.data.offers.price.taxes.amount=43.06
return.data.offers.price.taxes.amount=507.17
return.data.offers.price.taxes.amount=380.82
return.data.offers.price.taxes.amount=379.94

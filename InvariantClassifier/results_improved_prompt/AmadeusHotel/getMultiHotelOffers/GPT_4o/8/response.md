### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` has a query parameter `boardType` which is used to filter the response based on available meal options. The possible values for `boardType` in the request are:
- ROOM_ONLY
- BREAKFAST
- HALF_BOARD
- FULL_BOARD
- ALL_INCLUSIVE

The response schema includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`. Each offer has a `boardType` field, which can take on a broader set of values than the request parameter, including:
- ROOM_ONLY
- BREAKFAST
- HALF_BOARD
- FULL_BOARD
- ALL_INCLUSIVE
- BUFFET_BREAKFAST
- CARIBBEAN_BREAKFAST
- CONTINENTAL_BREAKFAST
- ENGLISH_BREAKFAST
- FULL_BREAKFAST
- DINNER_BED_AND_BREAKFAST
- LUNCH
- DINNER
- FAMILY_PLAN
- AS_BROCHURED
- SELF_CATERING
- BERMUDA
- AMERICAN
- FAMILY_AMERICAN
- MODIFIED

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `input.boardType == return.boardType`, meaning that the `boardType` specified in the request should match the `boardType` of the offers returned in the response.

### Analysis

- **Request vs. Response Values**: The request parameter `boardType` is used to filter the offers, but the response `boardType` can include a wider range of values. This suggests that the response `boardType` is not necessarily restricted to the value of the request `boardType`.
- **Examples and Calls**: Out of 100 calls, no counterexamples were found, and 8 examples were found with 2 distinct values. However, the limited number of distinct examples and the broader range of possible response values indicate that the invariant might not hold universally.
- **Semantic Consideration**: The `boardType` in the response is meant to describe the meal plan included in the offer, which could be different from the filter applied in the request, especially since the response allows for more specific meal types.

### Conclusion

Given the broader set of possible values for `boardType` in the response and the semantic purpose of the `boardType` field in describing the meal plan, it is likely that the invariant `input.boardType == return.boardType` does not hold universally. The response can include offers with different meal plans than the filter applied, especially since the response schema explicitly allows for more specific meal types.

**Verdict**: false-positive

**Confidence**: 0.9

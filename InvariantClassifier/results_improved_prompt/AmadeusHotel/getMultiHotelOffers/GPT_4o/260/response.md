### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides hotel offers, each containing a list of policies. Within these policies, there are two relevant properties:

1. **Cancellation Policy**:
   - `numberOfNights`: An integer indicating the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation.

2. **Deposit Policy**:
   - `acceptedPayments`: An object that includes `creditCards`, which is an array of strings representing accepted payment card types. Each string is a two-letter code.

### Invariant

The invariant states that the size of the `creditCards` array minus one is divisible by the `numberOfNights` without a remainder:

`size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]) - 1 % return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights == 0`

### Analysis

- **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant attempts to establish a mathematical relationship between the number of accepted credit card types and the number of nights due as a cancellation fee. However, these two fields are semantically unrelated. The number of credit card types accepted does not logically correlate with the cancellation fee structure.

- **Empirical Evidence**: Despite 10,000 calls without a counterexample, the invariant is based on a single distinct example, which is not sufficient to establish a meaningful pattern or rule, especially given the lack of semantic connection.

- **Specification Review**: The specification does not suggest any inherent relationship between the number of accepted credit card types and the cancellation policy. The invariant seems to be coincidental rather than intentional or meaningful.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic connection between the two fields and the reliance on a single distinct example, the invariant is likely a "false-positive." The absence of counterexamples in 10,000 calls is not compelling enough to override the lack of logical connection between the variables.

**Confidence**: 0.7

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes a REST API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a list of hotel offers. Each hotel offer includes a `hotel` object, which contains a `longitude` property. The `longitude` is defined as a number, which typically represents the geographical coordinate of the hotel.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.hotel.longitude != 0`. This invariant suggests that the longitude value for any hotel returned by this API is never zero.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**: Longitude is a geographical coordinate that can theoretically take any value between -180 and 180. A longitude of 0 is a valid geographical coordinate, representing the Prime Meridian. However, it is uncommon for hotels to be located exactly on the Prime Meridian, especially given the vast number of possible locations worldwide.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 16,406 examples were observed, with 259 distinct longitude values, none of which were zero. This suggests that, empirically, the API does not return a longitude of zero.

3. **Specification and Context**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly restrict the longitude values, but the absence of zero in the observed data suggests that the data source or the API logic might inherently avoid or filter out such values. This could be due to data quality checks, geographical relevance, or other business logic.

### Conclusion

Given the large number of examples and the absence of zero in the longitude values, combined with the understanding that hotels are unlikely to be located exactly on the Prime Meridian, it is reasonable to conclude that the invariant `return.hotel.longitude != 0` is a "true-positive". The invariant holds under the current implementation and data distribution of the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes an endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a `200` status code. The response schema is an object containing a `data` property, which is an array of items. Each item in this array has an `offers` property, which is also an array. Each offer contains a `price` object, which includes a `markups` array. The `markups` array consists of objects with an `amount` property described as a string representing a monetary value.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.price.markups == null`, which suggests that the `markups` array in the `price` object of each offer is always `null`.

### Analysis

- **Number of Calls**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This high number of calls without any counterexamples strongly suggests that the invariant holds true under the conditions tested.
- **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not explicitly state that `markups` must be non-null or provide any default values. It only describes the structure of `markups` if it exists.
- **Semantic Context**: The `markups` field is described as optional information about additional charges. It is plausible that in many cases, especially if no additional charges are applied, this field could be `null`.

### Conclusion

Given the high number of calls and the lack of counterexamples, combined with the semantic plausibility that `markups` could be `null` when no additional charges are applied, the invariant is likely a "true-positive." The specification does not contradict this possibility, and the absence of `markups` could be a common scenario.

**Verdict**: true-positive

**Confidence**: 0.9 (High confidence due to the number of calls and the semantic plausibility)

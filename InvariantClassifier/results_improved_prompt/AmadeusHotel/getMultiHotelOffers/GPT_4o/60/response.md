### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/shopping/hotel-offers`
- **Method**: GET
- **Parameter**: `adults` (integer, required, 1-9)
- **Response**: Contains a `data` array with `offers`, each having `policies` which include `guarantee` policies with `acceptedPayments` methods.

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.adults >= size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[])`
- **Type**: `IntGreaterEqual`
- **Description**: The number of adults in the request is greater than or equal to the number of accepted payment methods in the response.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Meaning**:
   - The `adults` parameter represents the number of adult guests per room.
   - The `acceptedPayments.methods` represents the different payment methods accepted for a booking.

2. **Logical Connection**:
   - There is no direct logical connection between the number of adults and the number of payment methods. The number of adults does not inherently determine or limit the number of payment methods available.

3. **Examples and Counterexamples**:
   - We have 100 calls with no counterexamples, but only 6 distinct examples.
   - The examples show varying numbers of adults and payment methods, but the invariant holds due to the limited number of distinct examples and the lack of counterexamples.

4. **Specification Check**:
   - The specification does not suggest any relationship between the number of adults and the number of payment methods.
   - The invariant seems coincidental based on the examples rather than a rule enforced by the API.

### Conclusion

The invariant `input.adults >= size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[])` appears to be a **false-positive**. The number of adults and the number of payment methods are unrelated concepts, and the invariant holds due to the limited dataset rather than an actual rule. The lack of counterexamples is likely due to the small sample size and not indicative of a true relationship.

**Confidence**: 0.7, as the invariant lacks logical basis and is not supported by the specification.

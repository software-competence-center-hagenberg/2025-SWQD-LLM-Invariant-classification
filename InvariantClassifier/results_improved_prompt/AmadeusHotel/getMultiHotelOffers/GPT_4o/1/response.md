### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provided describes a REST API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` which returns hotel offers. The response schema includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`, each having a `price` object. Within `price`, there is a `taxes` array, where each tax has a `pricingMode` property. The `pricingMode` is a string that specifies if the tax applies per occupant or per room, with possible values being `PER_OCCUPANT` and `PER_PRODUCT`.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: "return.pricingMode one of { "PER_OCCUPANT", "PER_PRODUCT" }". This invariant suggests that the `pricingMode` field in the response always takes one of these two values.

### Analysis
- **Swagger Specification**: The swagger explicitly defines `pricingMode` as having two possible values: `PER_OCCUPANT` and `PER_PRODUCT`. This aligns perfectly with the invariant.
- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 22,609 examples were observed, with only two distinct values (`PER_OCCUPANT` and `PER_PRODUCT`), which are exactly the values specified in the swagger.
- **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant is semantically consistent with the API's purpose and the swagger definition. The `pricingMode` is meant to specify a mode of pricing, and the two modes provided are logical and exhaustive based on the swagger.

### Conclusion
Given the swagger definition explicitly lists `PER_OCCUPANT` and `PER_PRODUCT` as the only possible values for `pricingMode`, and the empirical evidence supports this with a large number of examples and no counterexamples, the invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant is correctly identifying the constraints on the `pricingMode` field as defined by the API specification.

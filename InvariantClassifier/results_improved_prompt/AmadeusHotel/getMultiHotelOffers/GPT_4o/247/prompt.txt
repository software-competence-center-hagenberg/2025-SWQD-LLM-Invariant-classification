Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                hotel:
                  type: object
                  description: Hotel Content
                  properties:
                    latitude:
                      type: number
                      description: Latitude


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.hotel.latitude != 0

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.NonZeroFloat
Invariant description: Represents double scalars that are non-zero. Prints as x != 0.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 16406 examples in the requests data, with 258 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.data.hotel.latitude=-34.92729
return.data.hotel.latitude=40.70906
return.data.hotel.latitude=51.50797
return.data.hotel.latitude=35.65294
return.data.hotel.latitude=13.74266

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides a GET method to retrieve hotel offers. The response schema includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`. Each offer has a `price` object, which includes `variations`. The `variations` object has a `changes` array, which describes periods during which the price changes. Each element in the `changes` array is an object with properties such as `startDate`, `endDate`, `currency`, `sellingTotal`, `total`, `base`, and `markups`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.price.variations.changes[] elements != null`. This invariant implies that none of the elements in the `changes` array are `null`.

### Analysis

1. **Schema Analysis**: According to the schema, the `changes` array is supposed to contain objects with specific properties. The schema does not explicitly state that `null` values are allowed in the `changes` array.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests that in practice, the API does not return `null` elements in the `changes` array.

3. **Semantic Analysis**: The `changes` array is meant to describe price variations over time. It would be semantically incorrect to have `null` entries in this array, as each entry is supposed to represent a specific period with defined start and end dates and associated pricing information.

### Conclusion

Given the schema's implication that `changes` should contain objects with specific properties, the lack of any counterexamples in 10,000 calls, and the semantic expectation that each entry in `changes` should be a valid period object, it is highly likely that the invariant `return.price.variations.changes[] elements != null` is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the expected behavior of the API as described in the schema and observed in practice.

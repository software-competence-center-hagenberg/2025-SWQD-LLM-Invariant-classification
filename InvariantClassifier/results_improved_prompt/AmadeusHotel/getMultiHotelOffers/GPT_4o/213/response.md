### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- **Endpoint**: `/shopping/hotel-offers`
- **Parameter**: `adults`
  - **Type**: integer
  - **Range**: 1 to 9
  - **Description**: Number of adult guests per room.
- **Response**: Contains a `data` array with `offers`, each having a `policies` object.
  - **Policies**: Includes a `guarantee` object with `acceptedPayments`.
  - **Accepted Payments**: Contains `creditCards`, an array of strings (2 uppercase letters).

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.adults <= size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards[])`
- **Type**: `IntLessEqual`
- **Description**: The number of adults is less than or equal to the number of accepted credit card types.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `adults` parameter represents the number of adult guests per room.
   - The `creditCards` array represents the types of credit cards accepted for payment.
   - There is no direct semantic relationship between the number of adults and the number of accepted credit card types.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 500 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 153 examples were found, with 52 distinct examples.
   - Example values show that the invariant holds in all tested cases.

3. **Specification Analysis**:
   - The specification does not imply any relationship between the number of adults and the number of credit card types.
   - The invariant seems coincidental rather than logically necessary.

### Conclusion

The invariant `input.adults <= size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards[])` is likely a **false-positive**. The lack of a semantic relationship between the number of adults and the number of credit card types suggests that the invariant holds by coincidence rather than necessity. The specification does not support this invariant, and the empirical evidence, while strong, does not override the lack of logical connection.

**Confidence**: 0.7

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- **Endpoint**: `/shopping/hotel-offers`
- **Operation**: GET
- **Parameter**: `roomQuantity` (integer, 1-9)
- **Response**: Contains a `data` array with `offers`, each having `policies` which include `guarantee` details. The `guarantee` object contains `acceptedPayments` with a `methods` array of strings representing payment methods.

### Invariant
- **Invariant**: `size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[])-1 % input.roomQuantity == 0`
- **Type**: NumericInt$Divides
- **Description**: The size of the `methods` array minus one is divisible by `roomQuantity` without remainder.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Relevance**: The invariant attempts to relate the number of accepted payment methods to the number of rooms requested. However, there is no semantic or logical connection between the number of payment methods and the number of rooms. The number of payment methods is more likely to be related to the hotel's policies or agreements with payment providers, not the number of rooms requested.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not suggest any relationship between `roomQuantity` and `acceptedPayments.methods`. The `methods` array is described as containing various payment methods, which are independent of the room quantity.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: Although 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the lack of a semantic connection and the arbitrary nature of the invariant suggest that the invariant is coincidental rather than indicative of a true relationship.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of a logical connection between the number of rooms and the number of payment methods, combined with the arbitrary nature of the invariant, it is highly likely that this invariant is a false-positive. The invariant appears to be a coincidental result of the specific data observed rather than a true invariant of the API.

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.9

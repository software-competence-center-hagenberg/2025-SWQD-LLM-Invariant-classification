### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides hotel offers, and the response includes a `data` array. Each item in this array contains `offers`, which further includes `policies` with details on `deposit` and `cancellation` policies.

- **`deposit`**: Contains information about accepted payments, including `creditCards`, which is an array of strings representing accepted credit card types. These strings are constrained to be exactly two uppercase letters (e.g., 'VI' for Visa).
- **`cancellation`**: Contains a `description` object with a `text` field, which is a free text string.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.policies.cancellation.description.text in return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]`

This suggests that the free text description of the cancellation policy is always one of the accepted credit card types.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Mismatch**: The `cancellation.description.text` is described as free text, which typically means it can contain any descriptive information about the cancellation policy. It is unlikely to be constrained to match a credit card type, which is a very specific and structured format (two uppercase letters).

2. **Specification Details**: The `creditCards` field is specifically for credit card types, which are distinct from free text descriptions. There is no logical or semantic reason why a free text description of a cancellation policy would match a credit card type.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: Although 100 calls did not find a counterexample, this could be due to a limited dataset or specific conditions under which the API was tested. The semantic mismatch strongly suggests that the invariant is not universally true.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic mismatch between the fields involved in the invariant and the specific nature of credit card type strings, it is highly unlikely that the invariant is a true-positive. The lack of counterexamples in 100 calls does not outweigh the logical inconsistency of the invariant.

**Verdict**: False-positive

**Confidence**: 0.9 (high confidence due to the clear semantic mismatch)

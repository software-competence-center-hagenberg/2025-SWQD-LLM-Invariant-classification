### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- **Endpoint**: `/shopping/hotel-offers`
- **Operation**: `GET`
- **Parameter**: `roomQuantity` (integer, 1-9)
- **Response**: Contains `data` which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `room` object with a `typeEstimated` property, which includes `beds` (integer, 1-9).

### Invariant
- **Invariant**: `input.roomQuantity >= return.room.typeEstimated.beds`
- **Type**: `IntGreaterEqual`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `>=` between two long scalars.

### Analysis
- **Semantic Analysis**: The invariant compares the number of rooms requested (`roomQuantity`) with the number of beds in a room (`beds`). Semantically, these are different concepts: `roomQuantity` refers to the number of rooms a user wants to book, while `beds` refers to the number of beds in a single room.
- **Swagger Constraints**: Both `roomQuantity` and `beds` have the same range (1-9), but they represent different entities.
- **Empirical Evidence**: 100 calls were made, and no counterexamples were found. However, only 35 examples were observed, with 12 distinct examples.
- **Example Analysis**: The examples provided show that `roomQuantity` is always greater than or equal to `beds`, but this does not inherently make sense as a rule. For instance, a user might request 1 room with 2 beds, which would violate this invariant if `roomQuantity` is less than `beds`.

### Conclusion
- **Verdict**: `false-positive`
- **Reasoning**: The invariant does not make semantic sense because it compares two unrelated quantities: the number of rooms requested and the number of beds in a room. While the invariant holds in the observed examples, it is not logically sound to assume it will hold in all cases, especially given that the number of beds in a room does not constrain the number of rooms requested.
- **Confidence**: 0.8 (high confidence due to semantic mismatch and logical reasoning)

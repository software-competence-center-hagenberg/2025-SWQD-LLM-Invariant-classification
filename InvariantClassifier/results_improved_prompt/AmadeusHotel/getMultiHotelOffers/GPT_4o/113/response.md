### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes an endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a nested structure. In the response, there is a `data` array containing `offers`, each of which has a `price` object. This `price` object includes `variations`, which further contains `changes`. Each `change` has a `startDate` property, which is described as a string with the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is that `return.startDate` is a Date in the format `YYYY/MM/DD` or `YYYY-MM-DD`, with the separator being either `/` or `-`.

### Analysis
1. **Swagger Specification**: The Swagger definition explicitly states that `startDate` is a string formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`. This aligns with the invariant's allowance for the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 81,961 examples were observed, with 11 distinct examples, all of which conform to the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

3. **Format Flexibility**: The invariant allows for both `YYYY-MM-DD` and `YYYY/MM/DD` formats. However, the Swagger specification only mentions `YYYY-MM-DD`. The empirical data supports the `YYYY-MM-DD` format exclusively, as seen in the provided examples.

4. **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant makes semantic sense as `startDate` is expected to be a date, and the format `YYYY-MM-DD` is a standard date representation.

### Conclusion
Given the alignment of the Swagger definition with the invariant, the extensive empirical evidence supporting the invariant, and the semantic appropriateness of the invariant, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant's flexibility in allowing `YYYY/MM/DD` does not contradict the observed data, as the primary format `YYYY-MM-DD` is consistently used.

**Verdict**: True-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

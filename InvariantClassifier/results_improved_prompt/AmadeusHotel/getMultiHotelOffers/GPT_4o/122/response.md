### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provides details about the `/shopping/hotel-offers` endpoint. The response schema includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`, each having a `rateCode`. The `rateCode` is defined as a string with a fixed length of 3 characters, as indicated by the `pattern: ^[A-Z0-9*]{3}$`, `minLength: 3`, and `maxLength: 3`. The description also lists several examples of valid rate codes, all of which are 3 characters long.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.rateCode)==3`, which asserts that the `rateCode` in the response always has a length of 3 characters.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: The Swagger definition explicitly states that the `rateCode` should have a fixed length of 3 characters, supported by the `pattern`, `minLength`, and `maxLength` constraints.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there were 41,891 examples of `rateCode`, with 96 distinct examples, all adhering to the 3-character length.
3. **Examples Provided**: The examples given (`MIL`, `EAM`, `ROM`, `1BB`, `NKS`) all conform to the 3-character length requirement.

### Conclusion

Given the explicit constraints in the Swagger definition and the empirical evidence from the test calls, the invariant `LENGTH(return.rateCode)==3` is consistent with the API's specification and observed behavior. Therefore, it is highly likely to be a "true-positive" invariant.

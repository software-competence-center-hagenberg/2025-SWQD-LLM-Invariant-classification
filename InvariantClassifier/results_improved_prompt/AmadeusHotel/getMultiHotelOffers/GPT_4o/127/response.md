### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provides information about the `/shopping/hotel-offers` endpoint. The response schema includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`. Each offer has a `room` object with a `type` property. The `type` is described as a 3-character identifier for the room, with specific meanings assigned to each character. The pattern for this field is specified as `^[A-Z0-9*]{3}$`, indicating that it should be exactly three characters long, consisting of uppercase letters, digits, or an asterisk.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.room.type)==3`, which asserts that the `room.type` string in the response is always of length 3.

### Analysis

1. **Pattern Specification**: The Swagger definition explicitly states that the `room.type` should match the pattern `^[A-Z0-9*]{3}$`, which inherently means the string must be exactly 3 characters long.

2. **Number of Calls and Examples**: The invariant was tested over 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there were 41,726 examples with 350 distinct values, all adhering to the 3-character length.

3. **Example Values**: The provided example values (`YSP`, `D9K`, `BVF`, `REG`, `2VK`) all conform to the 3-character length requirement.

4. **Special Case**: The definition mentions a special case where `ROH` (Run Of House) is returned, which also fits the 3-character length.

### Conclusion

Given the explicit pattern requirement in the Swagger definition, the extensive testing without counterexamples, and the alignment of all example values with the invariant, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant is consistent with the documented API behavior and the observed data.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes an endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` with a `GET` operation. The response schema for a successful `200` response includes an object with a property `data`, which is an array. Each item in this array is an object with a property `type`, described as a string with the description "the type of the object (hotel-offers)".

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `return.type == "hotel-offers"`, which suggests that the `type` field of each item in the `data` array in the response is always the string "hotel-offers".

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Description**: The Swagger description explicitly states that the `type` field is "the type of the object (hotel-offers)". This suggests that the field is intended to have the value "hotel-offers".

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, there were 16,624 examples of the invariant holding true, with only one distinct value observed, which matches the expected value "hotel-offers".

3. **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant is semantically consistent with the description provided in the Swagger documentation. The `type` field is described as representing the type of the object, and the only type mentioned is "hotel-offers".

### Conclusion

Given the explicit description in the Swagger documentation, the empirical evidence from a large number of calls, and the semantic consistency of the invariant, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns with the intended design of the API as described in the documentation.

**Verdict**: true-positive

**Confidence**: 0.95

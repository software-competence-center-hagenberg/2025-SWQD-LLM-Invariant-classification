### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` is designed to retrieve hotel offers based on the number of adult guests specified in the query parameter `adults`. The `adults` parameter is an integer that must be between 1 and 9. The response includes a list of offers, each containing policies with accepted payment methods.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is:

`input.adults % size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0`

This invariant suggests that the number of adults specified in the request divides the number of accepted payment methods without a remainder.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Relationship**: The `adults` parameter represents the number of adult guests, while `acceptedPayments.methods` represents the payment methods accepted for a booking. There is no inherent semantic relationship between the number of adults and the number of payment methods.

2. **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not indicate any dependency or relationship between the number of adults and the number of payment methods. The payment methods are described as a list of options that may be available, independent of the number of adults.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant held true for 100 calls, with 20 examples and 6 distinct examples. However, the lack of a semantic relationship and specification support suggests that this invariant is coincidental rather than a true constraint of the API.

4. **Example Analysis**: The examples provided do not show a clear pattern or reason why the number of adults should divide the number of payment methods. For instance, having 5 adults and 1 payment method, or 2 adults and 2 payment methods, seems arbitrary and not indicative of a rule.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of semantic connection and specification support, the invariant is likely a coincidence rather than a true constraint of the API. The invariant does not logically follow from the API's intended functionality or documented behavior.

**Verdict**: False-positive

**Confidence**: 0.8

      - `offers`: Array
        - `guests`: Object
          - `adults`: Integer
            - **Description**: Number of adult guests (1-9) per room

### Invariant

- **Invariant**: `input.adults == return.guests.adults`
- **Type**: `daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual`
- **Description**: Represents an invariant of `==` between two long scalars. Prints as `x == y`.

### Analysis

1. **Parameter and Response Consistency**:
   - The `adults` parameter in the request is described as the number of adult guests per room, with a constraint of 1 to 9.
   - The `adults` field in the response under `guests` also describes the number of adult guests per room, with the same constraint.

2. **Semantic Alignment**:
   - Both the request parameter and the response field refer to the same concept: the number of adult guests per room.
   - The invariant `input.adults == return.guests.adults` semantically makes sense as the response should reflect the request parameter for the number of adults.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 6,010 examples were found with 9 distinct values, all supporting the invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the semantic alignment between the request parameter and the response field, the constraints specified in the swagger definition, and the empirical evidence from a large number of calls without counterexamples, the invariant `input.adults == return.guests.adults` is highly likely to be a **true-positive**.

The invariant is consistent with the API's intended functionality as described in the swagger documentation, and the extensive testing supports its validity.

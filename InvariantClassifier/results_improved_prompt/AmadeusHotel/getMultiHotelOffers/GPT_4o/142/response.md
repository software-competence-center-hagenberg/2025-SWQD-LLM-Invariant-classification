### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides hotel offers. The response includes a `data` array, where each item contains an `offers` array. Each offer has a `category` (a string indicating a special rate category) and a `room` object with a `description` that includes a `text` field (a free text description).

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.category` is a substring of `return.room.description.text`. This means that the category of the offer should appear somewhere within the description text of the room.

### Analysis
- **Swagger Specification**: The specification does not explicitly state that the `category` should be included in the `room.description.text`. The `category` is described as a special rate category, while the `description.text` is free text meant to describe the room.
- **Examples and Calls**: Out of 100 calls, only 1 distinct example supports the invariant, where `category` (GOV) is a substring of `description.text` (GOVT MILITARY RATE...). This is a weak evidence base, as only 1 distinct example was found.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Semantically, it does not necessarily make sense for a rate category to always be a substring of a room description. The room description could contain various details unrelated to the rate category.

### Conclusion
Given the semantic mismatch between the `category` and `description.text`, and the lack of strong evidence from the examples (only 1 distinct example), it is unlikely that this invariant holds universally. The invariant seems to be coincidental rather than a rule enforced by the API.

Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** with a confidence of 0.7.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provides details about a REST API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` which returns hotel offers. The response schema includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`. Each offer has a `room` object, and within this object, there is a `typeEstimated` object that includes a `beds` property. This `beds` property is described as an integer representing the number of beds in the room, with a range of 1 to 9.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is:

`return.room.typeEstimated.beds one of { 1, 2, 3 }`

This invariant suggests that the number of beds in the room is always one of the values 1, 2, or 3.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Specification**: According to the Swagger definition, the `beds` property can take any integer value between 1 and 9. This explicitly contradicts the invariant, which restricts the values to only 1, 2, or 3.

2. **Empirical Data**: The invariant was tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 185 examples were observed, with only 3 distinct values (1, 2, and 3) being recorded.

3. **Possible Explanation**: The lack of counterexamples and the limited distinct values observed could be due to the specific dataset or hotel offers being tested, which might predominantly feature rooms with 1, 2, or 3 beds. However, this does not rule out the possibility of rooms with 4 to 9 beds existing in the broader dataset or in future API responses.

### Conclusion

Given the explicit range provided in the Swagger definition (1-9), the invariant that restricts the `beds` property to only 1, 2, or 3 is a **false-positive**. The observed data might be skewed due to the specific sample or dataset used during testing, but it does not align with the documented specification.

**Confidence**: 0.9, due to the clear contradiction between the invariant and the Swagger specification.

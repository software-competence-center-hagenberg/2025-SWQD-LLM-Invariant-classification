Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.hotel.chainCode)==2

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 16624 examples in the requests data, with 43 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.data.hotel.chainCode=IQ
return.data.hotel.chainCode=IN
return.data.hotel.chainCode=CH
return.data.hotel.chainCode=GI
return.data.hotel.chainCode=CP

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes a REST API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` with a `GET` method. The response schema for a successful request (HTTP status 200) includes a `data` property, which is an array of objects. Each object in this array contains an `offers` array, and each offer has a `policies` object. The `policies` object includes a `cancellation` property, which is an object with a `type` property. The `type` property is a string that can only take the value `FULL_STAY`, as specified by the enum constraint.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is `LENGTH(return.policies.cancellation.type)==9`. This invariant suggests that the `type` property of the `cancellation` object always has a fixed length of 9 characters.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Definition**: The `type` property of the `cancellation` object is explicitly defined to have a single possible value: `FULL_STAY`. The length of the string `FULL_STAY` is indeed 9 characters.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 2,886 examples were observed, all of which had the `type` value `FULL_STAY`, confirming the fixed length of 9 characters.

3. **Semantic Consistency**: The invariant is semantically consistent with the API specification, as the `type` property is constrained by an enum to only have the value `FULL_STAY`.

### Conclusion

Given the explicit constraint in the Swagger definition that the `type` property can only be `FULL_STAY`, and the empirical evidence supporting this invariant across a large number of API calls, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant is consistent with both the specification and the observed data.

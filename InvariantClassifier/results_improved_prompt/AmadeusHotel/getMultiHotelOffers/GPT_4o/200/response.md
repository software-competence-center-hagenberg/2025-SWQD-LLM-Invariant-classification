### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` returns a list of hotel offers. Each offer includes a `price` object with `variations` that detail daily price changes and a `policies` object that includes `deposit` information. The `deposit` object contains `acceptedPayments`, which includes a list of `creditCards`.

- **price.variations.changes[]**: An array of objects representing periods with different prices.
- **policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]**: An array of strings representing accepted credit card types.

### Invariant

The invariant states that the size of the `changes` array minus one should be divisible by the size of the `creditCards` array without a remainder.

### Analysis

1. **Semantic Relevance**: The `changes` array and the `creditCards` array represent different concepts. `changes` is about price variations over time, while `creditCards` is about payment methods. There is no inherent semantic relationship between the number of price change periods and the number of accepted credit card types.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, only 3 distinct examples were observed, which is a small sample size.

3. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not suggest any relationship between the number of price changes and the number of accepted credit cards.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of semantic connection between the two fields and the small number of distinct examples, it is unlikely that this invariant is a true-positive. The invariant seems to be coincidental rather than a rule enforced by the API's logic or data structure.

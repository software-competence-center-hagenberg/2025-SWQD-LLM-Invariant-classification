### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provides details about the `/shopping/hotel-offers` endpoint, specifically focusing on the `policies` object within the `offers` array in the response. The `paymentType` property is a string that can take on several enumerated values: `GUARANTEE`, `DEPOSIT`, `PREPAY`, `HOLDTIME`, `guarantee`, `deposit`, `prepay`, `holdtime`.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: "`return.policies.paymentType` one of { "deposit", "guarantee" }".

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Enum Values**: The Swagger definition explicitly lists the possible values for `paymentType` as `GUARANTEE`, `DEPOSIT`, `PREPAY`, `HOLDTIME`, `guarantee`, `deposit`, `prepay`, `holdtime`. This indicates that `paymentType` can take on more values than just `"deposit"` and `"guarantee"`.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: Despite the Swagger definition allowing for more values, the empirical data from 10,000 calls shows that only `"deposit"` and `"guarantee"` were observed. This suggests that in practice, the API might currently be returning only these two values.

3. **Potential for Change**: The presence of additional values in the Swagger definition suggests that the API could potentially return other values in the future or under different conditions. This makes the invariant potentially unstable or incorrect in the long term.

### Conclusion

Given the discrepancy between the Swagger definition and the observed data, the invariant is likely a "false-positive". The Swagger definition explicitly allows for more values than those observed, indicating that the invariant does not hold universally according to the specification. The high number of calls without counterexamples suggests a current implementation detail rather than a guaranteed invariant.

**Confidence**: 0.8, due to the strong evidence from the Swagger definition that contradicts the invariant.

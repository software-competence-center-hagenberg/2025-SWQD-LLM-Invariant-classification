### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provides details about the `/shopping/hotel-offers` endpoint. The response schema includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`. Each offer has `policies`, and within `policies`, there is a `deposit` object. The `deposit` object has an `amount` property, which is described as a string representing the deposit/prepay amount.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is that `return.policies.deposit.amount` is always numeric. This means that the string value of `amount` should only contain numeric characters, potentially including decimal points, but no alphabetic characters or symbols.

### Analysis

1. **Data Type and Description**: The `amount` is defined as a string in the Swagger definition. However, it is described as representing a monetary amount, which is typically numeric.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical backing for the invariant.

3. **Example Provided**: The example given is `0.00`, which is a numeric string, consistent with the invariant.

4. **Semantic Consistency**: It makes semantic sense for a deposit amount to be numeric, as it represents a monetary value. Even though it is stored as a string, the content is expected to be numeric.

5. **Specification Ambiguity**: The specification does not explicitly mention any non-numeric formats for the `amount`, such as currency symbols or text descriptions, which supports the invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the strong empirical evidence from 10,000 calls without counterexamples, the semantic appropriateness of the invariant, and the lack of specification details suggesting otherwise, it is highly likely that the invariant is a "true-positive." The invariant aligns with the expected use of the `amount` field as a numeric value, despite being stored as a string.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides hotel offers, and the response includes a `data` array. Each item in this array contains `offers`, which further includes `policies` with a `deposit` object. The `deposit` object has `acceptedPayments`, which specifies `creditCards` as an array of strings. These strings represent accepted credit card types, constrained by a pattern of two uppercase letters.

### Invariant

The invariant states that the `creditCards` array in the response is always one of two specific sets of strings:
- `[AX, CA, DC, EC, IK, JC, VI]`
- `[VI, AX, CA, DC, EC, JC, CU, MC, IK]`

### Analysis

1. **Pattern and Length Constraints**: The `creditCards` array elements must be two uppercase letters, which aligns with the invariant's examples.
2. **Distinct Values**: The invariant is based on only 50 calls, which is a relatively small sample size. However, the invariant holds for all calls, and no counterexamples were found.
3. **Semantic Plausibility**: The credit card codes in the invariant (e.g., `VI` for Visa, `AX` for American Express) are plausible and commonly used in payment systems.
4. **Specification Flexibility**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly restrict the `creditCards` to only these values, suggesting potential for other valid credit card types not observed in the sample.

### Conclusion

Given the small sample size and the lack of explicit restriction in the Swagger definition, the invariant is likely a **false-positive**. The observed values may reflect a subset of possible values rather than an exhaustive list. The invariant could hold true in the tested environment but may not universally apply as the API could accept other credit card types not observed in the limited sample.

**Confidence**: 0.6, due to the small sample size and lack of explicit constraints in the specification.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` is designed to retrieve hotel offers. The response schema includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`. Each offer has a `policies` object, which includes a `deposit` object. The `deposit` object has an `acceptedPayments` object, which lists `methods` as an array of strings. These methods represent the accepted payment methods for the deposit/prepay policy. The possible values for these methods, as per the swagger definition, include:
- CREDIT_CARD
- AGENCY_ACCOUNT
- TRAVEL_AGENT_ID
- CORPORATE_ID
- HOTEL_GUEST_ID
- CHECK
- MISC_CHARGE_ORDER
- ADVANCE_DEPOSIT
- COMPANY_ADDRESS

### Invariant

The invariant in question is that the `methods` array in `acceptedPayments` is either `['CREDIT_CARD']` or `['CREDIT_CARD', 'ADVANCE_DEPOSIT']`.

### Analysis

1. **Swagger Definition vs Invariant**: The swagger definition lists multiple possible payment methods, not just `CREDIT_CARD` and `ADVANCE_DEPOSIT`. This suggests that other combinations or single values could be valid, which contradicts the invariant.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: Despite the swagger definition suggesting more possibilities, the empirical evidence from 10,000 calls shows only two distinct examples, both of which fit the invariant. This suggests that in practice, the API might be limited to these two combinations, at least under the conditions tested.

3. **Possible Explanations**: The limited observed values could be due to specific configurations, limitations in the test environment, or constraints not captured in the swagger definition.

### Conclusion

Given the discrepancy between the swagger definition and the observed data, the invariant is likely a **false-positive**. The swagger definition explicitly allows for more values, which means the invariant does not hold universally, even if it holds under the tested conditions. However, the high number of calls without a counterexample suggests a high confidence in the observed pattern, albeit not universally valid.

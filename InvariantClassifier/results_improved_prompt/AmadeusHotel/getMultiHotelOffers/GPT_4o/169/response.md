### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- **Endpoint**: `/shopping/hotel-offers`
- **HTTP Method**: GET
- **Parameter**: `adults` (integer, required, 1-9)
- **Response**: Contains a `data` array, which includes `offers`. Each offer has `policies` with a `deposit` object that includes `acceptedPayments`. This contains `creditCards`, an array of strings, each representing a credit card type with a pattern of two uppercase letters.

### Invariant
- **Invariant**: `size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[])-1 % input.adults == 0`
- **Type**: NumericInt$Divides
- **Description**: The size of the `creditCards` array minus one is divisible by the number of `adults` without a remainder.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The invariant suggests a relationship between the number of adult guests (`adults`) and the number of accepted credit card types (`creditCards`).
   - Semantically, there is no clear reason why the number of accepted credit card types should be related to the number of adults. The number of credit card types is more likely related to the hotel's payment policies rather than the number of guests.

2. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 3 distinct examples were found where the invariant holds.

3. **Specification Analysis**:
   - The swagger definition does not provide any indication that the number of credit card types should be influenced by the number of adults.
   - The invariant's logic seems arbitrary given the context of the API's purpose.

### Conclusion
The invariant appears to be a "false-positive" because there is no logical or semantic basis for the relationship it describes. The number of accepted credit card types should not logically depend on the number of adults in a room. The lack of counterexamples in 100 calls might be coincidental rather than indicative of a true relationship.

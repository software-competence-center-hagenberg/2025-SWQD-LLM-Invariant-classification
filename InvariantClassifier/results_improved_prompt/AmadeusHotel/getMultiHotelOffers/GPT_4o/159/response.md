### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The Swagger definition provided describes a REST API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` with a `GET` method. The response schema for a successful request (HTTP 200) is an object containing a `data` property, which is an array. Each item in this array is an object with a `type` property (string) and a `hotel` property, which is another object. The `hotel` object also has a `type` property (string).

### Invariant

The invariant in question is that `return.hotel.type` is a substring of `return.type`. Specifically, this means that the `type` value within each `hotel` object should be a substring of the `type` value of the parent object in the `data` array.

### Analysis

- **Data and Examples:** The invariant was tested with 10,000 API calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true across many different scenarios.
- **Distinct Examples:** Only one distinct example was found among 16,624 examples, indicating that the API might be returning a very consistent structure or set of values.
- **Example Values:** The example provided shows `return.data.type=hotel-offers` and `return.data.hotel.type=hotel`. In this case, "hotel" is indeed a substring of "hotel-offers".
- **Semantic Analysis:** The semantic relationship between the `type` of the hotel and the `type` of the data object makes sense. The `data.type` being "hotel-offers" suggests that it is a collection or list of hotel-related data, and each item within that list (i.e., each hotel) having a `type` of "hotel" is logically consistent.

### Conclusion

Given the large number of calls and examples without finding a counterexample, combined with the semantic consistency of the invariant, it is reasonable to conclude that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant aligns well with the expected structure and semantics of the API response.

**Verdict:** true-positive

**Confidence:** 0.95

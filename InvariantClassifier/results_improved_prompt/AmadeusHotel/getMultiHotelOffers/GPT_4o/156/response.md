### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` is a GET request that retrieves hotel offers. It accepts a query parameter `boardType`, which filters the response based on the type of meal plan available. The possible values for `boardType` are:
- ROOM_ONLY
- BREAKFAST
- HALF_BOARD
- FULL_BOARD
- ALL_INCLUSIVE

The response is an object containing a `data` array, where each item has a `self` property of type string.

### Invariant

The invariant states that `input.boardType` is a substring of `return.data.self`. This means that the value of `boardType` used in the request should appear somewhere within the `self` URL string in the response.

### Analysis

1. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.
2. **Example Analysis**: The provided examples show that the `boardType` value is indeed included in the `self` URL as a query parameter, which aligns with the invariant.
3. **Semantic Analysis**: The `self` URL is likely a link to the specific hotel offer that includes the query parameters used to generate the offer, including `boardType`. Therefore, it makes semantic sense for `boardType` to appear in the `self` URL.
4. **Specification Consistency**: The specification does not mention any exceptions or alternative behaviors for the `boardType` parameter that would contradict the invariant.

### Conclusion

Given the empirical evidence, semantic reasoning, and lack of contradictory information in the specification, the invariant that `input.boardType` is a substring of `return.data.self` is likely a "true-positive". The invariant is consistent with the expected behavior of the API, where the `self` URL reflects the query parameters used in the request.

**Confidence**: 0.95

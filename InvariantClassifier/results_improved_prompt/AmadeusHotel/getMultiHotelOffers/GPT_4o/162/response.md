### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides hotel offers. The response schema includes a `data` array, where each item represents a hotel with properties such as `hotelId` and `cityCode`.

- **hotelId**: A string of 8 characters, consisting of uppercase letters and digits, e.g., `ADPAR001`.
- **cityCode**: A 3-letter uppercase string, representing the IATA city code, e.g., `PAR`.

### Invariant

The invariant states that `return.hotel.cityCode` is a substring of `return.hotel.hotelId`.

### Analysis

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - `hotelId` is an 8-character string, which can include the `cityCode` as a substring.
   - `cityCode` is a 3-character string, which can naturally fit as a substring within the 8-character `hotelId`.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - Given examples show that the `cityCode` is indeed a substring of `hotelId` in all cases.
   - For instance, in `hotelId = WVMAD955`, `cityCode = MAD` is a substring.

3. **Empirical Evidence**:
   - 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample.
   - 16,624 examples were found, with 262 distinct examples, all supporting the invariant.

4. **Semantic Analysis**:
   - The `cityCode` being part of `hotelId` could be a design choice to embed location information within the property code.
   - The specification does not contradict this invariant, and the pattern allows for such a relationship.

### Conclusion

Given the extensive empirical evidence and the logical consistency with the specification, this invariant is likely a "true-positive". The invariant makes semantic sense, as embedding a city code within a hotel identifier is a plausible design choice for organizing hotel data.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` is a GET request that retrieves hotel offers. One of the query parameters is `checkInDate`, which specifies the check-in date for the hotel stay. This parameter is a string formatted as a date (YYYY-MM-DD) and must not be a date in the past. If not provided, it defaults to the current date in GMT.

The response schema includes a `data` array, where each item has a `self` field of type string. This field likely represents a URL or identifier related to the hotel offer.

### Invariant

The invariant in question is: `input.checkInDate` is a substring of `return.self`.

### Analysis

- **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong empirical basis for the invariant.
- **Distinct Examples**: Out of 9,777 examples, 8,348 were distinct, indicating a wide variety of test cases.
- **Example Values**: The examples provided show that `checkInDate` appears in the `self` URL as a query parameter, which is consistent with the invariant.
- **Semantic Consistency**: The `checkInDate` being part of the `self` URL makes semantic sense, as URLs often include query parameters that were part of the request.

### Conclusion

Given the strong empirical evidence, the semantic consistency of the invariant, and the lack of counterexamples, it is highly likely that this invariant is a "true-positive". The invariant logically follows from the structure of the URL in the response, which includes the `checkInDate` as a query parameter.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` provides hotel offers. The response schema includes a `data` array, which contains `offers`. Each offer has `policies`, which include a `cancellation` object. This `cancellation` object has a `description` property, which is an object containing a `text` field of type string. This `text` field is described as "Free Text" and is meant to convey specific information.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: "`return.policies.cancellation.description.text` one of { "NON-REFUNDABLE RATE", "Non refundable rate", "Plus Taxes and fees where appropriate." }".

### Analysis
1. **Number of Calls and Examples:** The invariant was tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a high likelihood that the invariant holds true across a wide range of scenarios.

2. **Distinct Examples:** There are 11,771 examples in the request data, with only 3 distinct values observed for the `text` field. This further supports the invariant, as it indicates that the field consistently takes on one of these three values.

3. **Semantic Analysis:** The `text` field is described as "Free Text" for conveying specific information. The examples provided ("NON-REFUNDABLE RATE", "Non refundable rate", "Plus Taxes and fees where appropriate.") are all plausible values for cancellation policies, suggesting that these are standard phrases used in the context of hotel offers.

4. **Specification Consideration:** The specification does not explicitly mention other possible values for the `text` field, nor does it contradict the invariant. The description of the field as "Free Text" could imply variability, but the consistent examples suggest otherwise.

### Conclusion
Given the large number of calls and examples, the lack of counterexamples, and the plausible nature of the values in the context of hotel offers, the invariant is likely a "true-positive". The invariant seems to accurately capture the possible values of the `text` field in the response.

**Confidence:** 0.95

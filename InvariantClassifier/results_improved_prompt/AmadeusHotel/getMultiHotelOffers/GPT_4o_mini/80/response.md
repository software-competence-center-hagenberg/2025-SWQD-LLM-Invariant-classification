### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that returns hotel offers, including booking rules such as deposit and cancellation policies. The relevant properties are:
- `return.policies.cancellation.type`: This is a string that indicates the type of cancellation policy, which can be `FULL_STAY` according to the enum defined.
- `return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]`: This is an array of strings that lists various accepted payment methods.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the cancellation type (`return.policies.cancellation.type`) is always a member of the accepted payment methods (`return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]`). 

### Analysis
1. **Semantics**: The cancellation type (`FULL_STAY`) is a policy related to the booking process, while the accepted payment methods are related to how the payment can be made. These two concepts are semantically different and do not overlap in meaning. 
2. **Swagger Definition**: The Swagger definition does not indicate that cancellation types can be included in the accepted payment methods. The accepted payment methods are specifically about payment options, while the cancellation type is about the penalty for cancellation. 
3. **Testing**: Although 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant is universally true. It may simply reflect the limited sample size or specific cases tested. 

### Conclusion
Given the semantic differences between cancellation types and payment methods, and the fact that the Swagger definition does not support the invariant, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant incorrectly assumes a relationship that does not exist based on the API's design. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that returns hotel offers, specifically detailing the structure of the response. Within the response, the `deposit` object contains an `amount` property, which is defined as a string. The description indicates that this string represents the deposit/prepay amount, but it does not explicitly restrict the format of this string to numeric values only.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.policies.deposit.amount` is always numeric, which is represented by the invariant type `daikon.inv.unary.string.IsNumeric`. This implies that the string value of `amount` must consist solely of numeric characters.

### Analysis
- **Response Structure**: The `amount` field is defined as a string in the Swagger definition. While it is common for numeric values to be represented as strings (e.g., "0.00"), the definition does not enforce that the string must only contain numeric characters. It could potentially include non-numeric characters (e.g., currency symbols, commas, etc.) depending on how the API is implemented.
- **Testing Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true in practice. However, the fact that the `amount` is defined as a string means that it could theoretically contain non-numeric characters, which would violate the invariant.
- **Examples Found**: The presence of 36 examples, with one distinct example being `0.00`, supports the notion that numeric values are returned. However, this does not conclusively prove that all possible values of `amount` are numeric, especially since the definition allows for a broader interpretation of what a string can contain.

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition allows for the `amount` field to be a string without explicitly restricting it to numeric characters only, the invariant that `return.policies.deposit.amount` is always numeric is likely a **false-positive**. While the testing data supports the invariant, the definition does not guarantee it, leading to uncertainty about the validity of the invariant in all cases. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

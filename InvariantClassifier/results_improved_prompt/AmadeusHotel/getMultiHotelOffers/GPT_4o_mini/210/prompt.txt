Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    policies:
                      type: object
                      description: Booking Rules
                      properties:
                        cancellation:
                          type: object
                          properties:
                            numberOfNights:
                              type: integer
                              description: Number of nights due as fee in case of cancellation.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights >= 1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.LowerBound
Invariant description: Represents the invariant x >= c, where c is a constant and x is a long scalar.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 4474 examples in the requests data, with 9 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=9
output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=8
output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=7
output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=6
output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=5

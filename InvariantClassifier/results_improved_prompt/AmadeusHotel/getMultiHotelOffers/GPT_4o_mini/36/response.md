### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines the structure of the response for the endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers`. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that the `acceptedPayments` field can contain various payment methods, including but not limited to `CREDIT_CARD`, `AGENCY_ACCOUNT`, `TRAVEL_AGENT_ID`, etc.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `acceptedPayments.methods` array will only contain the value `CREDIT_CARD`. This is represented as:

`return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[] == [CREDIT_CARD]`

### Analysis
1. **Multiple Accepted Payments**: The Swagger definition explicitly lists multiple accepted payment methods. This suggests that the `acceptedPayments.methods` array can contain various values, not limited to just `CREDIT_CARD`.
2. **Counterexamples**: Although 50 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the fact that there are multiple valid payment methods listed in the API documentation indicates that it is possible for other values to be present in the `methods` array.
3. **Distinct Examples**: The presence of 41 examples, with only 1 being distinct, does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the invariant holds universally. The existence of other valid payment methods in the specification contradicts the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the explicit mention of multiple accepted payment methods in the Swagger definition, the invariant that `acceptedPayments.methods[]` can only equal `CREDIT_CARD` is incorrect. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. 

**Confidence**: 0.9 - I am highly confident in this classification due to the clear contradiction between the invariant and the API specification.

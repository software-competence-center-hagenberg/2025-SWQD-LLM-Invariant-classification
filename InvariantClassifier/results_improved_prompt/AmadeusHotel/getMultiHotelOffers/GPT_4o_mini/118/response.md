### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition indicates that the `checkInDate` field is a string formatted as a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD. It explicitly states that the lowest accepted value is today’s date, meaning that dates in the past are not allowed.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.checkInDate` is a date in the format YYYY/MM/DD. This implies that the date can be represented with either slashes (/) or dashes (-) as separators. However, the Swagger definition only specifies the format as YYYY-MM-DD, which does not include slashes.

### Analysis
1. **Format Mismatch**: The invariant suggests that the date can be in the format YYYY/MM/DD, which contradicts the Swagger definition that strictly specifies YYYY-MM-DD. This discrepancy indicates that the invariant is not aligned with the API specification.
2. **Examples Provided**: The examples provided (2022-09-20, 2022-09-21, 2022-09-22) all conform to the YYYY-MM-DD format and do not include any examples with slashes. This further supports that the expected format is strictly YYYY-MM-DD.
3. **Counterexamples**: Although 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the invariant's allowance for slashes introduces a possibility for invalid dates according to the API specification.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant allows for a date format (YYYY/MM/DD) that is not supported by the API's Swagger definition (which only allows YYYY-MM-DD), the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear mismatch in expected date formats and the explicit definition in the API documentation.

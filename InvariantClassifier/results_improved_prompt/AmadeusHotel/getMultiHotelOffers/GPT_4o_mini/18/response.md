### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the `checkInDate` is a string formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`, and it explicitly states that the lowest accepted value is today's date, meaning dates in the past are not allowed.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `checkInDate` can only be one of three specific values: `"2022-09-20"`, `"2022-09-21"`, or `"2022-09-22"`. This is a restrictive condition that limits the possible values of `checkInDate` to only these three dates.

### Analysis
- The invariant is based on the observed data from 10,000 calls, where no counterexamples were found. However, the fact that only three distinct values were observed in the response data (from a total of 41,891 examples) does not necessarily mean that these are the only valid values. The API may allow for other valid dates beyond those observed.
- The specification allows for any future date starting from today, which means that the invariant is overly restrictive. The API could return any valid future date, not just the three specified.
- Since the invariant contradicts the flexibility implied by the API specification (which allows for any date from today onwards), it is likely a false-positive.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the `checkInDate` to only three specific values while the API allows for a broader range of future dates, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear contradiction with the API's specifications.

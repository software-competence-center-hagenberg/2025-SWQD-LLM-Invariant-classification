### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies that the `boardType` can take on a variety of values, including but not limited to: `ROOM_ONLY`, `BREAKFAST`, `HALF_BOARD`, `FULL_BOARD`, `ALL_INCLUSIVE`, etc. This indicates that the `boardType` can have many valid values as defined by the `enum`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.boardType` can only be one of two values: `BREAKFAST` or `ROOM_ONLY`. This is a restrictive claim that limits the possible values of `boardType` to just these two.

### Analysis
While the invariant has been tested with 100 calls and no counterexamples were found, the fact that the Swagger definition allows for many other values means that the invariant is overly restrictive. The existence of only two distinct examples (`BREAKFAST` and `ROOM_ONLY`) in the observed data does not negate the possibility of other valid values existing, as defined in the API specification. The invariant does not align with the broader set of values that `boardType` can take, as specified in the Swagger definition.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant contradicts the specification by limiting the possible values of `boardType` to only two, while the specification allows for many more, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear contradiction with the API specification.

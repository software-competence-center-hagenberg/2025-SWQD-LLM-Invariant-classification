Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.total == return.base

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StringEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two String scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers.price.variations.changes" in the response body.

We have tried 1000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 492 examples in the requests data, with 118 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.data.offers.price.variations.changes.total=252.78; output.data.offers.price.variations.changes.base=237.60
output.data.offers.price.variations.changes.total=287.00; output.data.offers.price.variations.changes.base=287.00
output.data.offers.price.variations.changes.total=295.00; output.data.offers.price.variations.changes.base=295.00
output.data.offers.price.variations.changes.total=150.00; output.data.offers.price.variations.changes.base=150.00
output.data.offers.price.variations.changes.total=440.00; output.data.offers.price.variations.changes.base=440.00

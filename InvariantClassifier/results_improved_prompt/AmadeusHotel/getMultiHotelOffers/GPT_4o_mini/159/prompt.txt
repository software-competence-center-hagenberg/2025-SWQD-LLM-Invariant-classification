Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                type:
                  type: string
                  description: the type of the object (hotel-offers)
              items:
                hotel:
                  type: object
                  description: Hotel Content
                  properties:
                    type:
                      type: string
                      description: type


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.hotel.type is a substring of return.type

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString
Invariant description: Represents the substring invariant between two String scalars. Prints as x is a substring of y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 16624 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:
output.data.type=hotel-offers; output.data.hotel.type=hotel

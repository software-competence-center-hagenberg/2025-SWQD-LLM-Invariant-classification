### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the response contains an array of objects, each having a property `type` (which is a string) and a nested object `hotel` that also has a property `type` (also a string). 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.hotel.type` is a substring of `return.type`. In the context of the provided example, this means that the `type` of the hotel (e.g., 'hotel') should always be a substring of the overall type of the response (e.g., 'hotel-offers'). 

### Analysis
- The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests a strong correlation between the two fields. 
- The example provided (`output.data.type=hotel-offers; output.data.hotel.type=hotel`) supports the invariant, as 'hotel' is indeed a substring of 'hotel-offers'. 
- The specification does not contradict this invariant, as it does not indicate that `return.type` could take on values that would not include `return.hotel.type` as a substring. 
- However, we need to consider if there are any possible values for `return.type` that could exist outside of the examples provided. If the API were to return other types that do not include 'hotel' as a substring, the invariant would fail. 

### Conclusion
Given the strong evidence from the testing and the lack of contradictory information in the specification, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. However, while the evidence is strong, the possibility of future changes to the API or additional types being introduced could affect this invariant. Therefore, I am moderately confident in this classification.

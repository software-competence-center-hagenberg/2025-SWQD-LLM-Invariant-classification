### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a REST API endpoint that returns hotel offers. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that the `endDate` field is a string formatted as a date, specifically in the format YYYY-MM-DD. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.endDate` is a date in the format YYYY/MM/DD. This implies that the expected format for `endDate` includes slashes (/) as separators, which contradicts the specified format in the Swagger definition that uses dashes (-). 

### Analysis
- The invariant suggests that the `endDate` can be in the format YYYY/MM/DD, which is not supported by the Swagger definition that explicitly states the format as YYYY-MM-DD. 
- Although the invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls and no counterexamples were found, the fact that the invariant contradicts the Swagger definition indicates that it is not a valid invariant. 
- The examples provided (e.g., 2022-09-30) confirm that the actual format used in the API response is YYYY-MM-DD, not YYYY/MM/DD. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant contradicts the Swagger definition and the expected format of the `endDate`, it is classified as a false-positive. The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, as it incorrectly specifies the date format.

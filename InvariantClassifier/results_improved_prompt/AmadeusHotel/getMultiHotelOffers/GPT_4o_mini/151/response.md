### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` allows users to retrieve hotel offers based on a specified check-in date. The `checkInDate` parameter must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD and cannot be a past date. The response contains an array of hotel offers, each with a `self` URL that includes various query parameters, including the `checkInDate`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.checkInDate` is a substring of `return.self`. This means that the check-in date provided in the request should appear somewhere within the URL returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Request and Response Relationship**: The `checkInDate` is included as a query parameter in the `self` URL of the response. Given that the API is designed to return offers based on the specified check-in date, it is logical that the check-in date would be part of the URL.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong correlation between the input and output, supporting the invariant's validity.
3. **Distinct Examples**: With 8,348 distinct examples of `input.checkInDate` and corresponding `output.data.self`, the consistency of the invariant across a wide range of inputs further reinforces its likelihood of being true.
4. **Specification Compliance**: The invariant does not contradict any part of the API specification. The specification allows for the check-in date to be part of the URL, and since it is a required parameter for the operation, it is expected to be present in the response.

### Conclusion
Given the strong empirical evidence, logical reasoning based on the API's design, and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant that `input.checkInDate` is a substring of `return.self` is classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the extensive testing and the nature of the API's functionality.

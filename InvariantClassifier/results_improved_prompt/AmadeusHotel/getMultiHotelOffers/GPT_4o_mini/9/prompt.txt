Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.rateCode == return.category

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StringEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two String scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 500 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 18 examples in the requests data, with 4 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 4 example values of the variables:
output.data.offers.rateCode=TVL; output.data.offers.category=TVL
output.data.offers.rateCode=MIL; output.data.offers.category=MIL
output.data.offers.rateCode=GOV; output.data.offers.category=GOV

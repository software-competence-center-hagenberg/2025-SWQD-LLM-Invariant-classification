### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers, with a query parameter `boardType` that can take on specific string values related to meal options. The response contains an array of objects, each with a `self` property that is a string URL.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.boardType` is a substring of `return.self`. This means that whatever value is passed as `boardType` in the request should appear somewhere within the URL returned in the `self` property of the response.

### Analysis
1. **Parameter Values**: The `boardType` parameter can take on specific values such as `ROOM_ONLY`, `BREAKFAST`, etc. These values are intended to filter the results based on meal options.
2. **Response Structure**: The `self` property in the response is a URL that may include various query parameters, including `boardType`. 
3. **Testing Results**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, and 3,395 distinct examples of `input.boardType` being a substring of `return.self` were found.
4. **Semantic Relevance**: The `boardType` is logically relevant to the `self` URL since it is included as a query parameter in the response. This suggests that the API is designed to reflect the request parameters in the response.

### Conclusion
Given the strong correlation between the request parameter and the response, along with the extensive testing that has not yielded any counterexamples, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive. The invariant holds true for the valid requests made to the API, as the design implies that the `boardType` will be reflected in the URL returned in the response.

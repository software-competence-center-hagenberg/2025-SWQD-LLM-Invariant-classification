### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that returns hotel offers, specifically detailing the structure of the response. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that the `cancellation` property contains a `numberOfNights` field, which is an integer representing the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `numberOfNights` can only take on the values 1 or 3. This is a restrictive condition on the possible values of this field.

### Analysis
- **Data Collection**: The invariant has been tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found, which suggests that the invariant holds for the tested cases. Additionally, 43 examples were found in the request data, with only 2 distinct values (1 and 3).
- **Specification Review**: The specification does not explicitly mention any other possible values for `numberOfNights`, which supports the idea that it may be limited to the values observed.
- **Semantic Context**: The `numberOfNights` field logically represents a count of nights, which typically would be a positive integer. The values 1 and 3 are plausible in the context of cancellation policies, as they could represent different cancellation fees.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of counterexamples and the logical consistency of the invariant with the API's intended functionality, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a "true-positive". However, the limited number of distinct examples (only 2) does introduce some uncertainty. Still, the absence of counterexamples and the alignment with the API's purpose lead to a high confidence in this classification.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` allows clients to request hotel offers in a specific currency. The `currency` parameter must be a valid ISO currency code, which is a three-letter uppercase string (e.g., EUR, USD). If the requested currency is not supported by a hotel, the API returns prices in the hotel's local currency. The response includes a `data` array, where each item has a `self` property that contains a URL.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.currency` is a substring of `return.self`. This means that the currency code provided in the request should appear somewhere within the URL returned in the `self` property of the response.

### Analysis
- The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found, which strongly suggests that the invariant holds true for the tested cases.
- The examples provided show that the `input.currency` is indeed present in the `return.self` URLs. For instance, in the first example, `input.currency=EUR` is found in the URL as a query parameter: `...&currency=EUR`. This pattern is consistent across all provided examples.
- The specification does not contradict this invariant, as it allows for the currency to be included in the URL when the hotel supports the requested currency.
- However, it is important to consider that the invariant might not hold in cases where the hotel does not support the requested currency, and the API returns the local currency instead. In such cases, the `self` URL may not contain the `input.currency` as a substring, which would violate the invariant.

### Conclusion
While the invariant holds true for the tested cases, the possibility of hotels not supporting the requested currency introduces uncertainty. Therefore, the invariant cannot be classified as a true-positive since it does not universally apply to all valid requests. It is more likely a false-positive due to the potential for exceptions based on hotel currency support.

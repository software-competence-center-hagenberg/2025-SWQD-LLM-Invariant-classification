### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` is designed to retrieve hotel offers based on the number of adult guests specified in the query parameter `adults`. The parameter `adults` must be an integer between 1 and 9, inclusive. The response includes an array of offers, each containing a `guests` object that specifies the number of adult guests.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the number of adults specified in the input request (`input.adults`) is equal to the number of adults returned in the response (`return.guests.adults`). This is expressed as `input.adults == return.guests.adults`.

### Analysis
1. **Request and Response Relationship**: The invariant suggests a direct relationship between the input parameter and the output response. Given that the API is designed to return offers based on the number of adults specified, it is reasonable to expect that the number of adults in the request should match the number of adults in the response.
2. **Testing Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which strongly supports the validity of the invariant. Additionally, 6,010 examples were found in the requests data, all of which consistently showed that the input and output values matched.
3. **Specification Compliance**: The specification does not contradict this invariant, as it explicitly states that the `adults` parameter in the request corresponds to the `adults` field in the response.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant `input.adults == return.guests.adults` holds true for the API as defined. The extensive testing and consistent results further reinforce that this invariant is a true-positive. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive** with high confidence.

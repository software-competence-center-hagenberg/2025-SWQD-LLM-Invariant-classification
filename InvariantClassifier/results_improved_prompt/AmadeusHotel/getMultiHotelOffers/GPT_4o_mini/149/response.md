### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies that the `cityCode` property of the hotel object is a string that must conform to the pattern `^[A-Z]{3}$`. This pattern indicates that the `cityCode` should consist of exactly three uppercase letters, which aligns with the invariant being evaluated.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `cityCode` is always 3: `LENGTH(return.hotel.cityCode)==3`. This is a direct consequence of the specified pattern in the Swagger definition.

### Analysis
Given that the pattern explicitly requires the `cityCode` to be exactly three uppercase letters, the invariant holds true for all valid responses from the API. The fact that 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample further supports the validity of this invariant. Additionally, the examples provided (FLR, SVQ, LPL, ADL, WAS) all conform to the expected length of 3 characters.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the Swagger definition and the evidence from the API calls, the invariant `LENGTH(return.hotel.cityCode)==3` is a true-positive. It is correct and holds for every valid request on the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that returns hotel offers. The response includes a property `dupeId`, which is a string that serves as a unique identifier for hotels. The description indicates that this identifier can be used to group hotels that are actually the same but represented by different providers.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.hotel.dupeId` is Numeric, which means that the characters of the string variable `dupeId` are always numeric.

### Analysis
1. **Nature of `dupeId`:** The `dupeId` is described as a string in the Swagger definition. While the examples provided (e.g., 700147217) are numeric, the fact that it is defined as a string means it can technically contain non-numeric characters (e.g., letters or special characters) in other cases, even if they are not present in the tested examples.
2. **Testing Results:** The testing conducted involved 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds for the tested cases. However, the absence of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant will hold for all possible cases, especially considering the definition of `dupeId` as a string.
3. **Specification Considerations:** The specification does not explicitly restrict `dupeId` to only numeric values, and since it is a string, it could potentially include non-numeric characters in different scenarios.

### Conclusion
Given that `dupeId` is defined as a string and could theoretically contain non-numeric characters, the invariant stating that it is always numeric is likely a false-positive. While the testing results are strong, the definition allows for the possibility of non-numeric values, which makes the invariant incorrect in a broader context. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with a confidence of 0.85.

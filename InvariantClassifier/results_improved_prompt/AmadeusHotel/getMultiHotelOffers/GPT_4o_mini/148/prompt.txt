Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                hotel:
                  type: object
                  description: Hotel Content
                  properties:
                    dupeId:
                      type: string
                      description: Unique Property identifier of the physical hotel.
                      One physical hotel can be represented by different Providers, each one having its own `hotelID`.
                      This attribute allows a client application to group together hotels that are actually the same.
                      example: 501132260


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.hotel.dupeId is Numeric

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.IsNumeric
Invariant description: Indicates that the characters of a string variable are always numeric. Represented as x is Numeric.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 8829 examples in the requests data, with 220 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.data.hotel.dupeId=700147217
output.data.hotel.dupeId=700056444
output.data.hotel.dupeId=700013837
output.data.hotel.dupeId=700022308

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The `checkOutDate` parameter is a string formatted as a date (YYYY-MM-DD) and must be greater than `checkInDate`. The response contains an array of hotel offers, where each offer has a `self` URL.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.checkOutDate` is a substring of `return.self`. This means that the value of `checkOutDate` should appear somewhere within the URL returned in the `self` field of the response.

### Analysis
1. **Request and Response Relationship**: The `checkOutDate` is included in the `self` URL as a query parameter. Given that the API is designed to return hotel offers based on the provided check-out date, it is logical that the check-out date would be part of the URL in the response.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong correlation between the input and output values.
3. **Distinct Examples**: With 8,042 distinct examples, the data supports the invariant's validity. The examples provided show that the `checkOutDate` is consistently included in the `self` URL.
4. **Semantics**: The semantics of the API suggest that the `checkOutDate` is relevant to the offers being retrieved, and thus it makes sense for it to appear in the response URL.

### Conclusion
Given the strong empirical evidence, the logical connection between the input and output, and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant that `input.checkOutDate` is a substring of `return.self` is classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the extensive testing and the nature of the API's design.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` allows clients to request hotel offers based on a specified number of rooms (`roomQuantity`). The valid range for `roomQuantity` is between 1 and 9. The response includes a list of offers, each containing a `policies` object that specifies accepted payment methods under `acceptedPayments.methods`. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter `roomQuantity` must be greater than or equal to the size of the array `acceptedPayments.methods` minus one. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

`input.roomQuantity >= size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods) - 1`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the number of rooms requested should be at least one less than the number of accepted payment methods. This implies that for every payment method available, there should be at least one room requested, plus one additional room.

2. **Evaluation of the Invariant**: Given the examples provided:
   - For `input.roomQuantity=5`, the accepted payment methods are `[

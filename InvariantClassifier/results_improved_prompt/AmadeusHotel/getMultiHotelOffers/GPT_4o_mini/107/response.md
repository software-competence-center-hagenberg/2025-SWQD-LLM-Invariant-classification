### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` is designed to retrieve hotel offers based on a list of hotel IDs provided as a query parameter. The `hotelIds` parameter is mandatory and is expected to be an array of Amadeus property codes, each 8 characters long. The response returns an object containing a `data` array, which presumably holds the hotel offers corresponding to the provided hotel IDs.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the input array `hotelIds` must be greater than or equal to the size of the returned `data` array. This means that for every request, the number of hotel IDs provided should be at least as many as the number of hotel offers returned.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Relationship**: The invariant suggests a direct relationship between the number of hotel IDs requested and the number of hotel offers returned. If a hotel ID is provided, it is expected that there will be at least one corresponding offer returned. However, it is possible that some hotel IDs do not have any offers available, which could lead to a situation where the size of `return.data[]` is less than `input.hotelIds[]`.

2. **Counterexamples**: The fact that no counterexamples were found in 10,000 calls suggests that, in practice, the API behaves consistently with this invariant. However, the absence of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant is universally true. It is possible that there are specific cases or edge cases that were not tested.

3. **Specification Considerations**: The specification does not explicitly state that every hotel ID must have a corresponding offer. Therefore, it is conceivable that a request with multiple hotel IDs could return fewer offers if some of those IDs do not have available offers.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, while the invariant holds true in the tested cases, the lack of explicit guarantees in the API specification about the relationship between `hotelIds` and `return.data` means that the invariant could potentially be violated in untested scenarios. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** due to the possibility of hotel IDs not having corresponding offers, which could lead to `size(input.hotelIds[])` being greater than `size(return.data[])`. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

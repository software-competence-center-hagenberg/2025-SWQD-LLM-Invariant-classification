Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
      - name: hotelIds
        in: query
        description: Amadeus property codes on 8 chars. Mandatory parameter for a search by predefined list of hotels.
        required: true
        example: [MCLONGHM]
        type: array
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                type: object
                properties:
                  type:
                    description: the type of the object (hotel-offers)
                  available:
                  self:
                  offers:
                  hotel:


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: size(input.hotelIds[]) >= size(return.data[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of >= between two long scalars. Prints as x >= y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 10508 examples in the requests data, with 9000 of them being distinct examples.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` is designed to return hotel offers based on a list of hotel IDs provided as a query parameter. The `hotelIds` parameter is mandatory and is expected to be an array of Amadeus property codes, each 8 characters long. The response includes a `data` object containing an array of `offers`, each of which has a `policies` object that includes a `cancellation` object. This cancellation object has a property `numberOfNights`, which is an integer representing the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `numberOfNights` in the response should not equal the size of the `hotelIds` array in the request: `return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights != size(input.hotelIds[])`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the number of nights due for cancellation should always differ from the number of hotel IDs provided in the request. 
2. **Counterexamples**: The invariant has been tested with 100 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests that it holds under the tested conditions. However, the invariant's correctness is not guaranteed by this alone, as it could still be coincidental.
3. **Semantics**: The `numberOfNights` could logically be related to the number of hotel IDs, as it might represent a cancellation policy that could vary based on the number of hotels booked. If a cancellation policy is defined per hotel, it is plausible that the number of nights could equal the number of hotels in certain cases. 
4. **Specification Review**: The specification does not explicitly state that `numberOfNights` must differ from the size of `hotelIds`. Therefore, it is possible that there are scenarios where they could be equal, especially if the cancellation policy is structured to charge a fee per hotel.

### Conclusion
Given the potential for the `numberOfNights` to be equal to the size of `hotelIds` based on the semantics of cancellation policies, and the lack of explicit restriction in the API specification, the invariant is likely a **false-positive**. While it has not been disproven in the tested calls, the possibility of it being false remains due to the logical relationship between the two variables. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

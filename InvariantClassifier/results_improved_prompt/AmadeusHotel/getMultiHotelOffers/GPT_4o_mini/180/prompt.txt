Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
      - name: hotelIds
        in: query
        description: Amadeus property codes on 8 chars. Mandatory parameter for a search by predefined list of hotels.
        required: true
        example: [MCLONGHM]
        type: array
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    policies:
                      type: object
                      description: Booking Rules
                      properties:
                        cancellation:
                          type: object
                          properties:
                            numberOfNights:
                              type: integer
                              description: Number of nights due as fee in case of cancellation.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights != size(input.hotelIds[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two long scalars. Prints as x != y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 6 examples in the requests data, with 6 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
input.hotelIds=WHUSM058%2CSIDXB408%2CHLMUC258; output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=1
input.hotelIds=HSLIMAAL%2CWVROM181; output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=3
input.hotelIds=MCBOGMCM%2CCPMCOD08; output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=1
input.hotelIds=HIDXBEE0%2CRCLGBRIR%2CWHUSM058%2CBWROM242; output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=1
input.hotelIds=RTPARNOV%2CHIBKK47E%2CARMADCUZ%2CHLADL215%2CONROMRIF; output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=1

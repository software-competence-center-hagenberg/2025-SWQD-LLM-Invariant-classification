### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` allows clients to request hotel offers with a specified language through the `lang` query parameter. The `lang` parameter accepts ISO language codes and has a defined pattern that allows for a variety of language codes (e.g., `FR`, `fr`, `fr-FR`). The response contains a `data` object, which includes a `self` field that is a URL string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.lang` is a substring of `return.self`. This means that whatever value is passed as the `lang` parameter in the request should appear somewhere within the URL returned in the `self` field of the response.

### Analysis
1. **Request and Response Relationship**: The invariant suggests a direct relationship between the request parameter `lang` and the response field `self`. Given that the `self` field is a URL that includes query parameters, it is reasonable to expect that the `lang` parameter would be included in the URL if it was part of the request.
2. **Examples Provided**: The provided examples show that the `lang` parameter is indeed included in the `self` URL, supporting the invariant. However, the invariant does not account for the possibility of the `lang` parameter being omitted from the URL in certain scenarios, such as when the requested language is not available and the response defaults to English.
3. **Counterexamples**: Although 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the invariant's validity could still be challenged if there are cases where the `lang` parameter is not included in the URL, especially if the API defaults to English or another language not specified in the request.

### Conclusion
While the invariant holds true for the majority of the tested cases, the potential for the API to return a URL without the `lang` parameter (especially in cases where the requested language is not available) suggests that the invariant may not universally hold. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition indicates that the `checkOutDate` is a string formatted as a date, specifically in the format YYYY-MM-DD. The definition also states that the lowest accepted value for `checkOutDate` is `checkInDate + 1`, which implies that the `checkOutDate` must always be after the `checkInDate`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.checkOutDate` is a date in the format YYYY/MM/DD. However, the Swagger definition specifies the format as YYYY-MM-DD. The invariant also suggests that the separator can be either '/' or '-', which is not supported by the Swagger definition that strictly defines the format as YYYY-MM-DD.

### Analysis
1. **Format Mismatch**: The invariant claims that the date can be in the format YYYY/MM/DD, which contradicts the Swagger definition that specifies YYYY-MM-DD. This discrepancy indicates that the invariant is incorrect since it allows a format that is not supported by the API.
2. **No Counterexamples Found**: While it is noted that no counterexamples were found in 10,000 calls, this does not validate the invariant since the format itself is incorrect according to the API specification.
3. **Semantic Consideration**: The invariant's assertion that the date can be represented with a '/' separator is semantically incorrect given the API's strict definition of the date format.

### Conclusion
Given the explicit mismatch between the invariant's format and the format defined in the Swagger specification, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear contradiction in date format specifications.

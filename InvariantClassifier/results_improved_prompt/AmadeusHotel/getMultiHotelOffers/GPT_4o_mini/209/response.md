### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that returns hotel offers, specifically detailing the structure of the response. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that the `typeEstimated` object contains a property `beds`, which is an integer representing the number of beds in a room. The description specifies that this value can range from 1 to 9.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.room.typeEstimated.beds >= 1`, which implies that the number of beds in a room must be at least 1.

### Analysis
Given the description in the Swagger definition, the `beds` property is explicitly stated to represent the number of beds in the room and is described to have a valid range of 1 to 9. Since the invariant requires that the number of beds is at least 1, and the specification confirms that this is the minimum valid value, the invariant aligns with the expected behavior of the API. 

Additionally, the testing conducted with 10,000 calls and the absence of counterexamples further supports the validity of this invariant. The presence of multiple examples where `beds` equals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 reinforces that the invariant holds true in practice.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the Swagger definition, the explicit constraints on the `beds` property, and the extensive testing results, the invariant `return.room.typeEstimated.beds >= 1` is classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the alignment with the API specification and the lack of counterexamples in testing.

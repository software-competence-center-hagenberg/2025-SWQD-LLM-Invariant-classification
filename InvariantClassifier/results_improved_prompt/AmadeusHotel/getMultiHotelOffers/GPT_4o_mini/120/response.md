### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the `roomQuantity` is a string that represents the number of rooms, which can take values from 1 to 9. The example provided in the definition shows that `roomQuantity` can be a string representation of these numbers.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of `return.roomQuantity` is always equal to 1, which means that the `roomQuantity` should always be a single character string. 

### Analysis
Given the examples provided (9, 8, 7, 6, 5), all these values are indeed single character strings. Since the API has been tested with 10,000 calls and no counterexamples were found, it suggests a strong consistency in the behavior of the API regarding this invariant. The invariant does not contradict the Swagger definition, as all valid values (1-9) are single character strings. 

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant that the length of `return.roomQuantity` is always 1 is a true-positive. The extensive testing and the nature of the values provided support this conclusion with high confidence.

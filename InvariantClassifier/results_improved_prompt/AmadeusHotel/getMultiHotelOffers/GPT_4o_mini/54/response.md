### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines the structure of the response for the `getMultiHotelOffers` endpoint. Specifically, it details the `acceptedPayments` object, which includes a property `creditCards` that is an array of strings. Each string in this array represents a payment card type and must conform to specific constraints (2 characters long, uppercase letters). 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the array `return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]` must be one of the values {7, 9}. This means that the array can only have either 7 or 9 elements. 

### Analysis
- **Data from Calls**: The invariant has been tested against 100 calls, with no counterexamples found. This suggests that the invariant holds for the tested cases. 
- **Distinct Examples**: There are 7 examples of the `creditCards` array, with 3 distinct configurations. All examples provided have either 7 or 9 elements, which aligns with the invariant. 
- **Specification Review**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly limit the number of accepted payment card types to 7 or 9. It only specifies that the `creditCards` array can contain multiple entries. Therefore, it is possible that other configurations (e.g., 6, 8, or more than 9) could also be valid according to the API's logic, which is not captured in the invariant. 

### Conclusion
While the invariant has shown consistency in the tested cases, the lack of explicit restrictions in the Swagger definition means that it is not guaranteed to hold for all valid requests. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** due to the potential for other valid sizes of the `creditCards` array that are not accounted for in the invariant.

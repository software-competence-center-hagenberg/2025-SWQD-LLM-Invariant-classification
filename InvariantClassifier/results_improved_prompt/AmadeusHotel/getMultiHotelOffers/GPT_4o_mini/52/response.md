### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines the structure of the response for the `getMultiHotelOffers` endpoint. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that the `price.variations.changes` is an array that contains objects representing price periods during a stay. Each object in this array includes properties such as `startDate`, `endDate`, `currency`, `sellingTotal`, `total`, and `base`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the array `return.price.variations.changes[]` must be greater than or equal to 1, meaning that there must be at least one price change period in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. This suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true for the current implementation of the API.
2. **Specification Review**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that the `changes` array can be empty. The description implies that it is expected to contain price variations, which supports the idea that there should be at least one entry in the array when price variations are applicable.
3. **Contextual Understanding**: In the context of hotel pricing, it is reasonable to expect that if there are variations in pricing, there would be at least one change period provided in the response. An empty array would imply no price variations, which may not align with the purpose of the endpoint.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of counterexamples in extensive testing and the alignment of the invariant with the expected behavior described in the Swagger definition, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the empirical evidence and the logical reasoning based on the API's purpose.

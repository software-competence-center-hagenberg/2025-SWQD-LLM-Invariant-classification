Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: size(return.price.variations.changes[]) >= 1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.LowerBound
Invariant description: Represents the invariant x >= c, where c is a constant and x is a long scalar.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 40692 examples in the requests data, with 16072 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.data.offers.price.variations.changes=[{"endDate":"2022-09-29","startDate":"2022-09-22","base":"2932.50"}]

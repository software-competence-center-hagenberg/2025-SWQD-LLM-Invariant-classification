### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that returns hotel offers, including booking rules under the `policies` object. The `cancellation` property contains a `description` object, which has a `lang` property that is a string, as per the definition.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `lang` property of the `description` object under `cancellation` must equal "EN". This is classified as a unary string invariant, suggesting that the `lang` property can only take on a limited set of values.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly limit the `lang` property to only "EN". It states that `lang` is a string that follows RFC 5646, which allows for a wide range of language tags (e.g., "fr-FR", "es-ES", etc.).
2. **Counter Examples**: Although 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant is correct. It is possible that other valid language codes were not tested.
3. **Distinct Examples**: The invariant mentions that there is only one distinct example found ("EN"). This suggests that while "EN" may be common in the tested data, it does not mean that it is the only valid value.
4. **Specification**: The specification does not restrict the `lang` field to only "EN", indicating that other values are permissible.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the `lang` property to only one value ("EN") while the Swagger definition allows for multiple values, this invariant is likely a false-positive. The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API as other language codes are valid according to the specification.

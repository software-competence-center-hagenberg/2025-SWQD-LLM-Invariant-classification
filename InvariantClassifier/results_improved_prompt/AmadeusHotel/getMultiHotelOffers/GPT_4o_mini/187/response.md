### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` is designed to retrieve hotel offers based on a list of hotel IDs provided as a query parameter. The `hotelIds` parameter is mandatory and is expected to be an array of Amadeus property codes, each 8 characters long. The response includes a list of offers, each with a `policies` object that contains a `deposit` object, which in turn has an `acceptedPayments` object. This object lists the accepted payment methods as an array of strings.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the array `return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]` minus one is divisible by the size of the input array `input.hotelIds[]`, expressed mathematically as:

`size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]) - 1 % size(input.hotelIds[]) == 0`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the number of accepted payment methods (minus one) should be divisible by the number of hotel IDs provided in the request. This implies a specific relationship between the number of hotel IDs and the accepted payment methods.
2. **Counterexamples**: The absence of counterexamples after 100 calls is a positive indicator, but it does not guarantee the invariant's correctness. The invariant could still be coincidentally holding true for the tested cases without being universally applicable.
3. **Semantic Consideration**: The invariant introduces a mathematical relationship between two variables that do not have an inherent connection in the API's logic. The accepted payment methods are not necessarily related to the number of hotel IDs in a way that would justify this invariant. For example, it is possible to have multiple hotel IDs but only one accepted payment method, or vice versa, without violating any business logic.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of a clear semantic relationship between the number of hotel IDs and the accepted payment methods, along with the fact that the invariant imposes a mathematical constraint that does not logically follow from the API's design, this invariant is likely a false-positive. The invariant does not hold universally for all valid requests, and its correctness is not supported by the API's specification. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

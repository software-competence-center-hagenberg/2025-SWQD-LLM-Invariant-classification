Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    policies:
                      type: object
                      description: Booking Rules
                      properties:

                          properties:
                            description:
                              type: object
                              description: Specific type to convey a list of string for specific information type ( via qualifier) in specific character set, or language
                              properties:
                                text:
                                  type: string
                                  description: Free Text
                                  example: A description


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: "return.policies.cancellation.description.text one of { ""NON-REFUNDABLE RATE"", ""Non refundable rate"", ""Plus Taxes and fees where appropriate."" }"

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.OneOfString
Invariant description: Represents String variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 11771 examples in the requests data, with 3 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 3 example values of the variables:
output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.description.text=Non refundable rate
output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.description.text=Plus Taxes and fees where appropriate.
output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.description.text=NON-REFUNDABLE RATE

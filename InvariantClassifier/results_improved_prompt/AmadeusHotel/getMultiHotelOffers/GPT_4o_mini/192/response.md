### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines the structure of the response for the `/shopping/hotel-offers` endpoint. It specifies that the response includes an array of offers, each containing price information and booking policies. The price information includes a `taxes` array, while the policies include an `acceptedPayments` object with a `methods` array.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `taxes` array minus one is divisible by the size of the `acceptedPayments.methods` array without a remainder. In mathematical terms, this means that the number of tax entries (after subtracting one) should be a multiple of the number of accepted payment methods.

### Analysis
1. **Contextual Relevance**: The invariant attempts to establish a relationship between the number of tax entries and the number of accepted payment methods. However, there is no inherent logical or business rule in the provided Swagger definition that connects these two quantities. The number of taxes applied to a booking does not necessarily correlate with the number of accepted payment methods.

2. **Empirical Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 500 calls, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 570 examples were collected, with 174 distinct examples. While the absence of counterexamples strengthens the case for the invariant, it does not guarantee its correctness, especially given the lack of a logical basis for the relationship.

3. **Potential for False-Positive**: Since the invariant imposes a mathematical relationship that does not seem to be supported by the API's business logic, it raises concerns about its validity. The invariant could hold true for the tested cases but may not be universally applicable across all possible responses from the API.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of a logical connection between the two quantities involved in the invariant and the fact that it imposes a specific mathematical relationship without clear justification from the API's specification, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive**. The confidence level is moderate due to the empirical evidence but tempered by the lack of logical support for the invariant's claim.

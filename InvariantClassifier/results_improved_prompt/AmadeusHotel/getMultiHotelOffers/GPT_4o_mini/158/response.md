### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` which returns a response containing an array of objects. Each object has two properties: `type` and `self`. The `type` is a string that describes the type of the object (in this case, it is consistently 'hotel-offers'). The `self` property is a string that contains a URL.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.type` is a substring of `return.self`. This means that the value of `type` should appear somewhere within the value of `self`.

### Analysis
1. **Data Consistency**: The examples provided show that the `type` is always 'hotel-offers', while the `self` property contains a URL. In all provided examples, the string 'hotel-offers' does not appear in the URLs of `self`. This indicates that the invariant does not hold for the examples given.
2. **Counterexamples**: Despite having tried 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, the examples provided suggest that the invariant is not valid. The fact that the invariant has been tested extensively without finding a counterexample could be due to the specific nature of the data returned by this API, but it does not guarantee that the invariant is universally true.
3. **Specification Compliance**: The Swagger definition does not imply that `type` should be a substring of `self`. In fact, it suggests that they serve different purposes: `type` describes the kind of object, while `self` provides a URL reference.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant that `return.type` is a substring of `return.self` is a **false-positive**. The examples provided do not support the invariant, and the semantics of the variables suggest that they are not related in the way the invariant claims. Therefore, I am confident in classifying this invariant as a false-positive.

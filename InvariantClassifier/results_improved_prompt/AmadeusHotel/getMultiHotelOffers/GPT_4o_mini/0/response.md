### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies that the `pricingFrequency` property can take on values of either 'PER_STAY' or 'PER_NIGHT'. This is explicitly stated in the description of the `pricingFrequency` property under the `taxes` array.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.pricingFrequency` can only be one of the values {"PER_NIGHT", "PER_STAY"}. 

### Analysis
Given that the Swagger definition explicitly allows for only these two values, the invariant aligns perfectly with the specification. The fact that there have been 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample further supports the validity of this invariant. The presence of 22,609 examples with only two distinct values also indicates that the invariant is likely correct, as it suggests that the API consistently returns only the specified values for `pricingFrequency`.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant is supported by the Swagger definition and has been validated through extensive testing without counterexamples, it is classified as a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is high due to the alignment with the API specification and the extensive testing results.

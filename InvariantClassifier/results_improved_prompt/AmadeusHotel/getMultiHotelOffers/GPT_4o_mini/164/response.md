### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition outlines the structure of the response from the `/shopping/hotel-offers` endpoint. The relevant part of the response indicates that the `acceptedPayments.methods` can include various payment methods, such as `CREDIT_CARD`, `AGENCY_ACCOUNT`, `TRAVEL_AGENT_ID`, and others. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the elements of `acceptedPayments.methods` can only be one of the two values: `CREDIT_CARD` or `TRAVEL_AGENT_ID`. 

### Analysis
1. **Exclusivity of Values**: The invariant restricts the accepted payment methods to only two options, which is a significant limitation given the Swagger definition that lists multiple possible payment methods. 
2. **Counterexamples**: Although 500 calls did not yield any counterexamples, the fact that the Swagger definition explicitly mentions other valid payment methods (e.g., `AGENCY_ACCOUNT`, `CORPORATE_ID`, etc.) suggests that the invariant is too restrictive. 
3. **Semantic Context**: The invariant does not take into account the full range of valid values for `acceptedPayments.methods`, which undermines its validity. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant contradicts the specification by limiting the accepted payment methods to only two options when the specification allows for more, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear contradiction with the Swagger definition.

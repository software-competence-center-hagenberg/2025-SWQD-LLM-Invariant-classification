### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided excerpt from the Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that returns hotel offers. Within the response schema, the `pricingMode` property is defined as a string that can take on specific values: `PER_OCCUPANT` and `PER_PRODUCT`. This is explicitly stated in the description of the `pricingMode` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `pricingMode` must be one of the values: `"PER_OCCUPANT"` or `"PER_PRODUCT"`. This is a unary string invariant that checks if the string variable takes on only a few distinct values.

### Analysis
The invariant aligns perfectly with the Swagger definition, which explicitly lists the allowed values for `pricingMode`. The fact that 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample further supports the validity of this invariant. Additionally, the presence of 22,609 examples with only two distinct values reinforces the idea that the invariant is likely correct, as it suggests that the API consistently returns only the specified values for `pricingMode`.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant is directly supported by the Swagger definition and the empirical evidence from the API calls, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a "true-positive". The invariant holds for every valid request on the API, as it is explicitly defined in the API specification and has been consistently observed in the responses.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the `beds` property within the `typeEstimated` object is an integer that represents the number of beds in a room, with a specified range of 1 to 9. This means that while the `beds` property can take on values between 1 and 9, it is not limited to just the values 1, 2, or 3.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the value of `return.room.typeEstimated.beds` can only be one of {1, 2, 3}. This is a restrictive condition that does not align with the broader range of possible values defined in the Swagger specification.

### Analysis
- The invariant restricts the possible values of `beds` to just three options (1, 2, 3), while the Swagger definition allows for a wider range (1 to 9).
- Although the testing has shown that in 100 calls, the invariant held true, the existence of other possible values (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) as per the specification means that the invariant cannot be considered universally valid.
- The fact that there are only three distinct examples found in the requests data does not negate the possibility of other values being valid according to the API's definition.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the `beds` property to only three values while the specification allows for a broader range, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the explicit range provided in the Swagger definition, which contradicts the invariant's restrictions.

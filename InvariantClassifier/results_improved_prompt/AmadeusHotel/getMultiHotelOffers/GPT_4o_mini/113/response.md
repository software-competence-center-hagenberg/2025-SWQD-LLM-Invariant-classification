### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the `startDate` field is a string formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`. This means that the expected format for dates is with hyphens, not slashes. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.startDate` is a date in the format `YYYY/MM/DD`, which includes slashes as separators. 

### Analysis
1. **Format Mismatch**: The invariant specifies a date format of `YYYY/MM/DD`, while the Swagger definition specifies `YYYY-MM-DD`. This is a clear contradiction. 
2. **No Counterexamples Found**: Although 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the format of the date itself is incorrect according to the API specification. 
3. **Semantic Context**: The invariant is semantically relevant as it pertains to date formatting, but it is incorrect due to the specified format in the API documentation. 

### Conclusion
Given the explicit contradiction between the invariant's date format and the Swagger definition, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the clear mismatch in expected formats.

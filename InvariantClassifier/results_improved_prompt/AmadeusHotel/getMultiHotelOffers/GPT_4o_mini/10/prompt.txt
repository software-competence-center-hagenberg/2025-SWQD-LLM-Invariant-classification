Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    rateFamilyEstimated:
                      type: object
                      description: The estimated rate code family of the offer. Grouping various rate plan codes that belongs to the same family and indicates the type of the rate
                      properties:
                        code:
                          type: string
                          description: The estimated rate family (PRO,FAM,GOV)
                          pattern: [A-Z0-9]{3}
                  items:
                    category:
                      type: string
                      description: Special Rate Category
                      Examples:
                        ASSOCIATION
                        FAMILY_PLAN
                      example: FAMILY_PLAN


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.rateFamilyEstimated.code == return.category

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StringEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two String scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 2 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:
output.data.offers.rateFamilyEstimated.code=GOV; output.data.offers.category=GOV

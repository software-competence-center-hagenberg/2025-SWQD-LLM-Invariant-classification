### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` accepts a query parameter `countryOfResidence`, which is a string that must conform to the ISO 3166-1 format (i.e., two uppercase letters). The response returns an object containing a `data` array, where each item has a `self` property that is a string URL.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.countryOfResidence` is a substring of `return.self`. This means that the country code provided in the request should appear somewhere within the URL returned in the `self` property of the response.

### Analysis
1. **Pattern Matching**: The `countryOfResidence` parameter is strictly defined to be two uppercase letters (e.g., 'CA', 'MX'). The URLs returned in the `self` property of the response contain the `countryOfResidence` as a query parameter, which means it is included in the URL.
2. **Evidence from Calls**: With 10,000 calls made and no counterexamples found, this strongly suggests that the invariant holds true across all tested scenarios. The examples provided show that the country code is indeed present in the URL as a query parameter.
3. **Semantic Relevance**: The invariant makes semantic sense because the country code is explicitly included in the URL, which is a common practice in APIs to indicate the context of the request.

### Conclusion
Given the strong evidence from the testing, the clear definition in the API specification, and the semantic relevance of the invariant, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The invariant is likely to hold for all valid requests to the API, as it aligns with the expected behavior of the endpoint.

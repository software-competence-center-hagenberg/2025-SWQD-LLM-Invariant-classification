### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` retrieves hotel offers based on the number of adult guests specified in the query parameter `adults`. The `adults` parameter must be an integer between 1 and 9. The response includes a list of offers, each containing a `policies` object, which in turn has a `guarantee` object that details accepted payment methods.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the number of adults (`input.adults`) must be divisible by the number of accepted payment methods (`return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]`). This is expressed mathematically as `input.adults % size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Variables**: The `input.adults` variable represents the number of adult guests, which can range from 1 to 9. The `return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]` represents the accepted payment methods, which can vary based on the hotel offer.
2. **Divisibility Logic**: The invariant implies that the number of adults must be a multiple of the number of accepted payment methods. This relationship does not inherently make sense in the context of hotel bookings, as the number of adults does not logically correlate with the number of payment methods accepted. For example, if there is only one payment method available, it is still possible to have any number of adults (1 to 9).
3. **Counterexamples**: Although 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee the invariant's correctness. The invariant's logic is flawed because it imposes a mathematical relationship that does not exist in the context of the API's functionality.

### Conclusion
Given the semantics of the variables and the nature of the API, the invariant is a **false-positive**. The relationship it describes does not hold true for all valid requests, as the number of adults does not need to be divisible by the number of accepted payment methods. Therefore, I am confident in this classification.

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` allows clients to request hotel offers based on the number of rooms specified by the `roomQuantity` parameter. The `roomQuantity` must be an integer between 1 and 9. The response includes a list of offers, each containing a `policies` object that specifies a `deposit` object. The `deposit` object includes `acceptedPayments`, which is an object containing an array of `methods` that represent the accepted payment methods.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `input.roomQuantity` must be greater than or equal to the size of the `acceptedPayments.methods` array minus one. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

`input.roomQuantity >= size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods) - 1`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the number of rooms requested should be at least one less than the number of accepted payment methods. This implies that for every room requested, there should be at least one accepted payment method available, plus one additional method.
2. **Request and Response Examples**: The provided examples show various combinations of `roomQuantity` and the corresponding `acceptedPayments.methods`. 
   - For `input.roomQuantity=5`, the methods array has 2 items: `[

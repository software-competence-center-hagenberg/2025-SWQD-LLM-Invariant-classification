### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that returns hotel offers, specifically focusing on the structure of the response. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that the `beds` property is an integer that can take values between 1 and 9. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the value of `return.room.typeEstimated.beds` can only be one of the values {1, 2}. This is a restriction on the possible values of the `beds` property.

### Analysis
1. **Response Schema**: The schema explicitly states that `beds` is an integer with a range from 1 to 9. This means that while the invariant holds for the examples provided (1 and 2), it does not account for the other possible values (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) that `beds` can take according to the schema.
2. **Counterexamples**: Although 50 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the fact that the schema allows for values beyond {1, 2} suggests that the invariant is too restrictive. The absence of counterexamples in the limited sample size does not guarantee that other values do not exist in the broader context of the API.
3. **Semantic Context**: The invariant restricts the `beds` property to only two values, which contradicts the broader definition that allows for a range of values. This indicates a misunderstanding of the variable's potential states.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the possible values of `beds` to only {1, 2} while the schema allows for a broader range (1-9), this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high because the schema explicitly contradicts the invariant's restrictions.

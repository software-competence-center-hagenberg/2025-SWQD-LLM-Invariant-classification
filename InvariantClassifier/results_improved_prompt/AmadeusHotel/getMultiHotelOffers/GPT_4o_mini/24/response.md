### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the response will include an array of offers, each containing a room object with a property called `typeEstimated`. This property is described as an estimated room category, bed type, and number of beds, which is derived from the room description and is provided for informational purposes.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.room.typeEstimated != null`, meaning that the `typeEstimated` field should not be null in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant asserts that the `typeEstimated` field will always have a value (i.e., it will never be null). 
2. **Swagger Definition Context**: The description of `typeEstimated` indicates that it is an informational field derived from the room description. This suggests that while the field is expected to be present, it may not always contain meaningful data, especially if the room description is vague or missing certain details.
3. **Testing Evidence**: The invariant has been tested with 100 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, this does not conclusively prove that the invariant holds true for all possible responses, especially since the specification does not explicitly guarantee that `typeEstimated` will always be non-null.
4. **Potential for Null Values**: Given that `typeEstimated` is derived from the room description, there may be scenarios where the description does not provide enough information to populate this field, leading to a null value.

### Conclusion
While the invariant has not been contradicted in the 100 calls made, the nature of the `typeEstimated` field and its dependency on the room description raises concerns about its reliability. Therefore, it is prudent to classify this invariant as a **false-positive** because the specification does not guarantee that `typeEstimated` will always be non-null, and there is a potential for it to be null in certain cases.

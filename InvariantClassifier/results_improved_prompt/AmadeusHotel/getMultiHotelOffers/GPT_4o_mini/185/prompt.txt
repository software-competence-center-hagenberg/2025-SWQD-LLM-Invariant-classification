Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights < size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards[])-1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntLessThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of < between two long scalars. Prints as x < y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 9 examples in the requests data, with 6 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=1; output.data.offers.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards=["AX","VI","CA","DC","CB","JC","CU"]
output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=3; output.data.offers.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards=["DC","DN","VI","MC","CA","AX"]
output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=1; output.data.offers.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards=["AX","VI","CA","DC","CB","JC","DS"]
output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=1; output.data.offers.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards=["AX","VI","CA","DC","CB","EC","JC"]
output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=1; output.data.offers.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards=["VI","CA","AX","JB","IK","EC","XS","JC"]

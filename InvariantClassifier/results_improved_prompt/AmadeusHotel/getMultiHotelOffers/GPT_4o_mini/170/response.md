### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` retrieves hotel offers based on the number of adult guests specified in the query parameter `adults`. The `adults` parameter must be an integer between 1 and 9. The response includes a list of offers, each containing a `policies` object that specifies the `deposit` information, which includes accepted payment methods.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.adults % size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0`. This means that the number of adults must be divisible by the number of accepted payment methods without a remainder.

### Analysis
1. **Semantics of Variables**: The `input.adults` variable represents the number of adult guests, while `return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]` represents the accepted payment methods. There is no inherent logical relationship between the number of adults and the number of accepted payment methods. The number of payment methods can vary independently of the number of adults.

2. **Counterexamples**: Although the invariant has not been contradicted in the 100 calls made, the lack of counterexamples does not imply that the invariant is universally valid. The examples provided show that for `input.adults=2`, the accepted payment methods can be either 1 or 2, which does not guarantee that the invariant will hold for all possible responses. For instance, if there are 3 accepted payment methods, `input.adults=2` would not satisfy the invariant since `2 % 3 != 0`.

3. **Specification Clarity**: The specification does not indicate that the number of adults must relate to the number of accepted payment methods in any way. This further supports the idea that the invariant is not valid.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant is likely a false-positive because it imposes a relationship between two variables that are not semantically connected. The invariant does not hold universally for all valid requests, as the number of accepted payment methods can vary independently of the number of adults. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with high confidence.

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.9

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.commission.amount in return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.sequenceString.MemberString
Invariant description: Represents String scalars that are always members of a sequence of String values. Prints as x in y[] where x is a String scalar and y[] is a sequence of String.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

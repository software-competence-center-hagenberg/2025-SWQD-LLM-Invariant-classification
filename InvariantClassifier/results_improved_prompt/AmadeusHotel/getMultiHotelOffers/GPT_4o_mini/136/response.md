### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition indicates that the `cancellation.type` property is a string with a specific enumeration value: `FULL_STAY`. This means that the only valid value for `cancellation.type` is `FULL_STAY`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of `return.policies.cancellation.type` is always 9 characters. Given the example provided, `output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.type=FULL_STAY`, we can see that the string `FULL_STAY` indeed has a length of 9 characters.

### Analysis
- The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample, which suggests a strong likelihood that the invariant holds true for the API.
- The specification does not contradict the invariant, as `FULL_STAY` is the only value allowed for `cancellation.type`.
- Since there are no other possible values for `cancellation.type`, and it has been consistently observed to be `FULL_STAY`, the invariant appears to be valid.

### Conclusion
Based on the provided information, the invariant that the length of `return.policies.cancellation.type` is always 9 is a true-positive. The evidence from the testing and the specification supports this conclusion with high confidence.

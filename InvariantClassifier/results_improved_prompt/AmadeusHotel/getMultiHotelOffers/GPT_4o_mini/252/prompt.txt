Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    commission:
                      type: object
                      properties:
                        amount:
                          type: string
                          description: Amount of the commission paid to the travel seller. The amount is always linked to the currency code of the offer


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: "return.commission.amount one of { ""1.78"", ""2.74"" }"

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.OneOfString
Invariant description: Represents String variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 173 examples in the requests data, with 2 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 2 example values of the variables:
output.data.offers.commission.amount=1.78
output.data.offers.commission.amount=2.74

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response containing an array of hotel offers. Each offer has a `category` property, which is a string. The examples provided in the Swagger definition include `ASSOCIATION` and `FAMILY_PLAN`, indicating that these are valid values for the `category` field.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `category` of the returned offers must equal `GOV`. This is a specific restriction on the possible values of the `category` field.

### Analysis
1. **Examples in Swagger**: The Swagger definition explicitly lists `ASSOCIATION` and `FAMILY_PLAN` as examples of valid values for the `category`. The invariant suggests that the only valid value is `GOV`, which contradicts the examples provided in the Swagger definition.
2. **Counterexamples**: Although the invariant has not been contradicted in the 100 calls made, the existence of other valid examples in the Swagger definition suggests that `GOV` is not the only valid value. The invariant restricts the `category` to a single value, which is not supported by the definition.
3. **Semantic Context**: The `category` field is semantically expected to have multiple possible values as indicated by the examples. Restricting it to only `GOV` does not align with the expected behavior of the API.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant contradicts the examples provided in the Swagger definition and that the `category` field is expected to have multiple valid values, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the explicit examples in the Swagger definition that contradict the invariant.

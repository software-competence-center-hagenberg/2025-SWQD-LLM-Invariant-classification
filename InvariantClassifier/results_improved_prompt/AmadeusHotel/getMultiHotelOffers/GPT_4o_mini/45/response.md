### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a REST API endpoint that returns hotel offers. The response schema indicates that within the `data` object, there is an array of `offers`, each containing a `policies` object. Within `policies`, there is a `cancellation` object which has a property `type`. The definition specifies that the `type` can only take the value `FULL_STAY` as indicated by the enum.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.policies.cancellation.type` should always equal `FULL_STAY`. This is a specific condition that checks the value of the `type` property in the response.

### Analysis
Given that the Swagger definition explicitly states that the `type` property can only take the value `FULL_STAY`, this invariant is directly supported by the API's specification. Furthermore, the testing conducted with 10,000 calls did not yield any counterexamples, and the majority of the examples (2886) also confirmed that the value was indeed `FULL_STAY`. This strong correlation between the specification and the observed behavior of the API suggests that the invariant is likely correct.

### Conclusion
Based on the explicit definition in the Swagger documentation and the extensive testing that supports the invariant, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a **true-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the lack of counterexamples and the clear specification in the API documentation.

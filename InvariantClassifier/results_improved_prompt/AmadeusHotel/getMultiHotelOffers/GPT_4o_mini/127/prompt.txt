Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    room:
                      type: object
                      properties:
                        type:
                          type: string
                          description: Room type code, 3 character identifier of the room.
                          The first character identifies the room type category. 
                          The second numeric character identifies the number of beds. 
                          The third character identifies the bed type. 
                          There is a special case where ROH is returned, this value stands for Run Of House.
                          pattern: ^[A-Z0-9*]{3}$


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.room.type)==3

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 41726 examples in the requests data, with 350 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.data.offers.room.type=ROH
output.data.offers.room.type=PKF
output.data.offers.room.type=VWK
output.data.offers.room.type=DSY
output.data.offers.room.type=PKD

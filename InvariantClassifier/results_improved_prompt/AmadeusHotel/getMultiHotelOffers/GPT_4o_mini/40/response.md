### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that returns hotel offers, including a section on payment policies. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that the `acceptedPayments` property can contain an array of strings representing various payment methods.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `acceptedPayments.methods` array can only contain either `CREDIT_CARD` or both `CREDIT_CARD` and `ADVANCE_DEPOSIT`. This is expressed as:
- `return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[] one of { [CREDIT_CARD], [CREDIT_CARD, ADVANCE_DEPOSIT] }`

### Analysis
- The invariant is based on the observed examples from the API responses. With 10,000 calls and 1,314 examples, the invariant holds true for the observed data. However, the invariant restricts the possible values of `acceptedPayments.methods` to only two specific combinations.
- The Swagger definition does not explicitly limit the accepted payment methods to just these two options. It lists multiple payment methods, suggesting that other values may also be valid.
- The invariant's restriction could potentially exclude valid payment methods that are not accounted for in the examples, such as `CHECK`, `MISC_CHARGE_ORDER`, etc.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the values of `acceptedPayments.methods` to only two specific combinations, while the Swagger definition suggests that there are more valid options, this invariant is likely a false-positive. The fact that there are no counterexamples found in the tested calls does not guarantee that these are the only valid options, as the API could return other valid payment methods not captured in the tested examples. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

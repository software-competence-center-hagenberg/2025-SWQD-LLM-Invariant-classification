### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a REST API endpoint that returns hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the `cancellation` property is an object that contains a `description` property, which in turn contains a `text` property of type string. The description suggests that this text can convey specific information, but does not limit it to a predefined set of values.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `text` field can only take on two specific values: "NON-REFUNDABLE RATE" and "Plus Taxes and fees where appropriate." This is a restrictive claim about the possible values of the `text` field.

### Analysis
1. **Response Schema**: The Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the values that the `text` property can take, other than that it is a string. This implies that the `text` property could potentially hold any string value, not just the two specified in the invariant.
2. **Examples Found**: While the invariant has been supported by 63 examples, with only 2 distinct values found, this does not conclusively prove that no other values are possible. The lack of counterexamples in 100 calls is noteworthy, but it does not eliminate the possibility of other valid values existing outside of the tested cases.
3. **Specification Clarity**: The invariant restricts the value of a variable based on observed examples, but the specification does not explicitly mention that these are the only valid values. Therefore, it is possible that other values could exist that have not been tested.

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition does not explicitly restrict the `text` property to the two values mentioned in the invariant, and considering the nature of the API response, the invariant is likely a false-positive. The invariant's claim is too restrictive compared to the flexibility implied by the API specification. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive** with a confidence level of 0.85, reflecting a strong belief in the classification based on the analysis of the API definition and the nature of the invariant.

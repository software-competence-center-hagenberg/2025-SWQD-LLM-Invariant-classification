### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` allows clients to request hotel offers based on a specified number of rooms (1-9). The response includes various details about the offers, including a guarantee policy that outlines accepted payment methods.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the array `return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]` minus one is divisible by the input parameter `roomQuantity`, expressed mathematically as:  
`size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]) - 1 % input.roomQuantity == 0`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the number of accepted payment methods (minus one) should be a multiple of the number of rooms requested. This implies a relationship between the number of payment methods and the room quantity.
2. **Request and Response Examples**: The examples provided show that for various values of `input.roomQuantity`, the `acceptedPayments.methods` array always contains a single method (`CREDIT_CARD`). This leads to the invariant evaluating to `0 % input.roomQuantity == 0`, which holds true for all tested cases.
3. **Counterexamples**: Despite testing 100 calls without finding a counterexample, the invariant's logic is questionable. The relationship between the number of accepted payment methods and the room quantity does not seem to have a logical basis. The payment methods are independent of the number of rooms requested, meaning that the invariant could fail in scenarios where multiple payment methods are available or if the API behavior changes in the future.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of a logical connection between the number of accepted payment methods and the room quantity, and considering that the invariant could easily be violated by future changes or different API responses, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is moderate due to the lack of counterexamples but high in the reasoning that the invariant does not hold semantically.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` allows clients to retrieve hotel offers based on the number of adult guests specified in the query parameter `adults`. The `adults` parameter must be an integer between 1 and 9. The response includes a list of offers, each containing a `policies` object that includes a `guarantee` object, which in turn contains an `acceptedPayments` object. This object lists accepted payment methods, specifically credit card types, in an array called `creditCards`. Each credit card type is represented as a string with a length of exactly 2 characters.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the number of adults (`input.adults`) must be less than or equal to the size of the array of accepted credit card types (`size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards[])`). In other words, the number of adult guests should not exceed the number of accepted credit card types available for the offer.

### Analysis
- The invariant is based on the relationship between the number of adults and the number of accepted credit card types. 
- The API documentation does not explicitly state that the number of adults must be less than or equal to the number of accepted credit card types. Therefore, while it may be a reasonable assumption, it is not guaranteed by the API specification.
- The fact that there are 500 calls without counterexamples and 153 distinct examples supporting the invariant suggests a strong correlation, but it does not definitively prove that the invariant holds in all cases.
- The invariant could potentially fail if there are offers that accept fewer credit card types than the number of adults specified, which is not ruled out by the API definition.

### Conclusion
While the invariant has strong empirical support from the tested calls, it is not explicitly guaranteed by the API specification. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is moderate due to the lack of counterexamples but the absence of explicit support in the API documentation.

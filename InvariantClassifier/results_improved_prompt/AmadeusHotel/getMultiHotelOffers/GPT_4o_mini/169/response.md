### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies a REST API endpoint that retrieves hotel offers. The relevant parameter is `adults`, which must be an integer between 1 and 9, indicating the number of adult guests per room. The response includes a list of offers, each with a `policies` object that contains a `deposit` object, which in turn has an `acceptedPayments` object. This object includes a `creditCards` array, which lists accepted payment card types.

### Invariant
The invariant in question states that the size of the `creditCards` array in the response must be divisible by the number of adults specified in the request, i.e., `size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]) - 1 % input.adults == 0`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the number of accepted credit card types should be a multiple of the number of adults. This implies that for every adult, there should be a corresponding accepted credit card type, which may not necessarily be a valid assumption based on the API's purpose.

2. **Counterexamples**: Although no counterexamples were found in the 100 calls made, the invariant's logic does not seem to align with the typical use case of hotel bookings. The number of accepted credit card types does not logically need to correlate with the number of adults. For example, a hotel might accept multiple credit cards regardless of the number of guests.

3. **Examples Provided**: The three examples provided do not contradict the invariant, but they do not provide sufficient evidence that the invariant holds universally. The fact that the invariant holds for these specific examples does not imply it will hold for all possible scenarios.

4. **Specification Considerations**: The specification does not indicate any relationship between the number of adults and the number of accepted credit cards, which further suggests that the invariant is not supported by the API's intended functionality.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant imposes a restriction that does not logically follow from the API's purpose and the lack of explicit support in the specification, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant is not guaranteed to hold for all valid requests, as the number of accepted credit cards does not need to be divisible by the number of adults. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

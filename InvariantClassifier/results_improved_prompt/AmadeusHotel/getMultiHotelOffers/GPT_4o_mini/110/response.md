### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies that the `currency` field is a string that represents a monetary unit, defined as a three-letter code (IATA code). The description explicitly states that examples include 'EUR' for Euros, 'USD' for US dollars, etc. This indicates that the `currency` field is expected to always be a three-character string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `currency` string must always be 3 characters: `LENGTH(return.currency)==3`. This is a specific case of a fixed-length string invariant.

### Analysis
Given that the Swagger definition explicitly mentions that the `currency` field is a three-letter code, the invariant aligns perfectly with the specification. Furthermore, the fact that 10 distinct examples of currency codes were provided, all of which are 3 characters long, supports the validity of the invariant. Additionally, the absence of counterexamples after 10,000 calls strengthens the case for this invariant being a true-positive.

### Conclusion
Based on the explicit definition in the Swagger documentation, the examples provided, and the lack of counterexamples, the invariant `LENGTH(return.currency)==3` is a true-positive. It holds for every valid request on the API as it is consistent with the specification.

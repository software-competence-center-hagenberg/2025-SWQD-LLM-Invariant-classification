### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` allows clients to request hotel offers based on the number of adult guests specified in the query parameter `adults`. The valid range for `adults` is between 1 and 9. The response includes various details about the offers, including a list of accepted payment methods under `policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards`. Each accepted payment method is represented as a string with a length of exactly 2 characters.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the number of adult guests (`input.adults`) must be less than or equal to the number of accepted credit card types minus one. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

`input.adults <= size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards) - 1`

### Analysis
- The invariant suggests that for every request made with a certain number of adults, there should be at least that many credit card types available minus one. 
- Given the examples provided, we see that for `input.adults = 2`, the response includes 7 credit card types, which satisfies the invariant since `2 <= 7 - 1` (2 <= 6). 
- For `input.adults = 1`, the response includes 8 credit card types, which also satisfies the invariant since `1 <= 8 - 1` (1 <= 7). 
- The invariant has been tested against 100 calls without finding a counterexample, and there are 37 examples supporting the invariant with 20 distinct examples.
- However, the invariant implies a restriction that may not be universally applicable. For instance, if there are only 2 credit card types available, the invariant would require that the number of adults must be 1 or less, which may not always hold true depending on the offers available.

### Conclusion
While the invariant holds true for the tested examples, it is not guaranteed to hold for all possible responses from the API. There could be scenarios where the number of accepted credit card types is low, and yet the number of adults requested is higher than allowed by the invariant. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. 

**Confidence**: 0.85

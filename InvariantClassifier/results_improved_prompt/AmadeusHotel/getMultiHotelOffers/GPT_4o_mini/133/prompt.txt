Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: All the elements of return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards[] have LENGTH=2

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.stringsequence.SequenceFixedLengthString

Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines the structure of the response from the `/shopping/hotel-offers` endpoint. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that the `lang` property is a string that follows the specifications of RFC 5646, which defines language tags.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `lang` string must always be equal to 2: `LENGTH(return.policies.cancellation.description.lang)==2`. This suggests that the language code is always expected to be a two-character string.

### Analysis
1. **RFC 5646 Compliance**: According to RFC 5646, language tags can vary in length. While some language codes are indeed two characters (like 'en' for English), others can be longer (like 'fr-FR' for French as spoken in France). Therefore, the invariant that the length must always be 2 is overly restrictive and does not account for valid language tags that may have more characters.

2. **Examples and Testing**: The invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls, and no counterexamples were found. However, the fact that only 119 examples were found in the requests data, with only 1 being distinct, raises concerns about the representativeness of the sample. It is possible that the tested cases did not cover all possible valid language tags.

3. **Semantic Context**: The invariant restricts the `lang` property to a fixed length of 2, which does not align with the broader definition of language tags as per RFC 5646. This suggests that the invariant is likely incorrect as it does not encompass the full range of valid values for the `lang` property.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant `LENGTH(return.policies.cancellation.description.lang)==2` is a **false-positive**. The specification allows for language tags of varying lengths, and the invariant does not hold for all valid cases. Therefore, I am confident in this classification.

Verdict: false-positive
Confidence: 0.95

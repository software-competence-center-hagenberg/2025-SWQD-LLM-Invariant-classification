### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that returns hotel offers, including booking rules and accepted payment methods. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that the `acceptedPayments` property can contain an array of payment methods, which includes several distinct values such as `CREDIT_CARD`, `AGENCY_ACCOUNT`, `CHECK`, etc.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the elements of the array `return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]` can only be one of the two values: `"ADVANCE_DEPOSIT"` or `"CREDIT_CARD"`. This means that the invariant restricts the accepted payment methods to just these two options.

### Analysis
1. **Scope of Values**: The Swagger definition explicitly lists multiple accepted payment methods, including `CREDIT_CARD` and `ADVANCE_DEPOSIT`, but also includes others like `AGENCY_ACCOUNT`, `CHECK`, etc. The invariant restricts the values to only two, which contradicts the broader set of options provided in the API documentation.
2. **Counter Examples**: Although 10,000 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the presence of other valid payment methods in the Swagger definition suggests that the invariant is too restrictive. The fact that only two distinct examples were found does not negate the possibility of other valid values being returned by the API.
3. **Semantic Context**: The invariant's restriction does not align with the semantic context provided by the API documentation. Since the API is designed to support multiple payment methods, limiting the response to only two does not make sense semantically.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the accepted payment methods to only two, while the API documentation allows for a broader set of options, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the explicit mention of multiple accepted payment methods in the Swagger definition, which contradicts the invariant's claim.

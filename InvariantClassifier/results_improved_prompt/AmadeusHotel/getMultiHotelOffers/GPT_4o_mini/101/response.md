### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies that the `hotelIds` parameter is a mandatory query parameter containing an array of Amadeus property codes, each of which is 8 characters long. The response schema indicates that the `hotelId` in the response is also an Amadeus property code, adhering to the same 8-character format.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `hotelId` returned in the response is always a member of the `hotelIds` input array. This is expressed as `return.hotel.hotelId in input.hotelIds[]`.

### Analysis
Given that the API is designed to return hotel offers based on the provided `hotelIds`, it is semantically reasonable to expect that the `hotelId` returned in the response should be one of the `hotelIds` provided in the request. The fact that the invariant has been tested with 10,000 calls without finding a counterexample strongly supports its validity. Additionally, the large number of distinct examples (10,486) further reinforces the likelihood that this invariant holds true across various valid requests.

### Conclusion
Based on the provided information, the invariant appears to be a true-positive. The semantics of the API suggest that the returned `hotelId` should indeed be a member of the input `hotelIds`, and the extensive testing without counterexamples supports this conclusion. Therefore, I classify this invariant as a **true-positive** with high confidence.

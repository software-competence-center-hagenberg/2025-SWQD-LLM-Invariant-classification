### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` is designed to retrieve hotel offers based on the number of adult guests specified in the query parameter `adults`. The `adults` parameter must be an integer between 1 and 9, inclusive. The response includes a list of offers, each containing a `policies` object that specifies accepted payment methods under `acceptedPayments.methods`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the number of adults specified in the request (`input.adults`) must be greater than or equal to the size of the array of accepted payment methods minus one: `input.adults >= size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]) - 1`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the number of adults must be at least one less than the number of accepted payment methods. This implies that for every adult, there should be at least one payment method available, plus one additional method.

2. **Contextual Relevance**: The invariant seems to imply a relationship between the number of adults and the payment methods available. However, there is no logical connection established in the API specification that dictates that the number of adults must correlate with the number of accepted payment methods. The accepted payment methods are independent of the number of adults.

3. **Counterexamples**: While there were no counterexamples found in the 500 calls made, the lack of counterexamples does not inherently validate the invariant. The invariant could still be false if the API allows for scenarios where the number of adults does not meet the condition stated in the invariant.

4. **Specification Clarity**: The API specification does not mention any requirement that ties the number of adults to the accepted payment methods. Therefore, the invariant is not supported by the API's intended functionality.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant imposes a restriction that is not supported by the API specification and lacks a logical basis, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, as the number of adults does not need to correlate with the number of accepted payment methods. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.85

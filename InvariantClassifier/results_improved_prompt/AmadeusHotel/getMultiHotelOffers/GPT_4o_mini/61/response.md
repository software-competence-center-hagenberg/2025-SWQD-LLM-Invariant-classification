### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition specifies a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that accepts a query parameter `roomQuantity`, which must be an integer between 1 and 9. The response includes an array of offers, where each offer contains a `room` object with a property `typeEstimated.beds`, which indicates the number of beds in the room and can also range from 1 to 9.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter `roomQuantity` must be greater than or equal to the number of beds in the room returned in the response: `input.roomQuantity >= return.room.typeEstimated.beds`. This means that the number of rooms requested should be at least as many as the number of beds available in the room offered.

### Analysis
1. **Parameter Constraints**: The `roomQuantity` is constrained to be between 1 and 9. The `beds` property also has a similar range (1-9). 
2. **Examples Provided**: The examples provided show various combinations of `roomQuantity` and `beds`. For instance:
   - `input.roomQuantity=7; output.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds=1` (holds true)
   - `input.roomQuantity=7; output.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds=2` (holds true)
   - `input.roomQuantity=2; output.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds=2` (does not hold true)
   - `input.roomQuantity=2; output.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds=1` (holds true)
   - `input.roomQuantity=9; output.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds=1` (holds true)
3. **Counterexamples**: The example `input.roomQuantity=2; output.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds=2` demonstrates a case where the invariant does not hold, as 2 is not greater than or equal to 2. This indicates that the invariant is not universally valid.

### Conclusion
Given that there is at least one counterexample where the invariant does not hold, we classify this invariant as a **false-positive**. The invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API, as shown by the provided examples. 

**Verdict**: false-positive
**Confidence**: 0.95

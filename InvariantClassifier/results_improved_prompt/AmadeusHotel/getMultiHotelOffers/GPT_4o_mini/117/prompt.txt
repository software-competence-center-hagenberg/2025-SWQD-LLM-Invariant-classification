Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    id:
                      type: string
                      description: Unique identifier of this offer. Might be valid for a temporary period only.
                      pattern: ^[A-Z0-9]*$
                      example: 63A93695B58821ABB0EC2B33FE9FAB24D72BF34B1BD7D707293763D8D9378FC3
                      minLength: 2
                      maxLength: 100


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.id)==10

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 41891 examples in the requests data, with 37114 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
output.data.offers.id=MEICVHHMJU
output.data.offers.id=3JUWYW4E9Z
output.data.offers.id=GHUAYQ701Q
output.data.offers.id=IZDPW8DKVW
output.data.offers.id=8M2KVLGLZV

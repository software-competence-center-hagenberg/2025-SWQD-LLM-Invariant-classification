### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that returns hotel offers. Each offer contains a `category` which is a string representing a special rate category, and a `room` object that contains a `description` with a `text` field that is also a string. The `category` can take on values like 'ASSOCIATION' or 'FAMILY_PLAN'. The `description.text` field provides a detailed description of the room, which can include various terms.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.category` is a substring of `return.room.description.text`. This means that whatever value is in the `category` field should appear somewhere within the `description.text` field of the room.

### Analysis
1. **Semantic Relevance**: The `category` field represents a specific type of rate, while the `description.text` provides a detailed description of the room. It is not semantically necessary for the category to be included in the room description. For example, a room could be described in detail without mentioning its rate category.

2. **Counterexamples**: Although 100 calls were made without finding a counterexample, the lack of counterexamples does not guarantee that the invariant holds universally. The two examples provided do show a case where the category is a substring of the description, but this is not sufficient to conclude that it will always be the case.

3. **Specification**: The specification does not indicate that the `category` must be included in the `description.text`. Therefore, there could be valid responses where the `category` is not found in the `description.text`, making the invariant potentially incorrect.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant requires a specific relationship between two fields that is not guaranteed by the API specification, and considering the semantic context where the category does not need to be part of the room description, I classify this invariant as a **false-positive**. The confidence in this classification is high due to the reasoning provided.

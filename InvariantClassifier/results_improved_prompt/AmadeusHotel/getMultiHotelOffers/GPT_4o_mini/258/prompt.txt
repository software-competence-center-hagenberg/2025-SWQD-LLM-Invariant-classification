Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]) % return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights == 0

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.NumericInt$Divides
Invariant description: Represents the divides without remainder invariant between two long scalars. Prints as x % y == 0.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 117 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples.
Here is an example values of the variables:
output.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=1; output.data.offers.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards=["VI","CA","AX","DC","IK","EC","XS"]

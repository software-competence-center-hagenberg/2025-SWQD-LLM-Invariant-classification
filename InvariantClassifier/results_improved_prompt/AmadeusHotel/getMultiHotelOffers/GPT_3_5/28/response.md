## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a response with a 'data' field containing an array of 'offers'. Each 'offer' contains a 'guests' field, which in turn contains a 'childAges' field.
- The 'childAges' field is an array of integers representing the ages of each child at the time of check-out from the hotel.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.guests.childAges == null', which means that the 'childAges' field in the 'guests' object should be null.

## Analysis
Based on the Swagger definition, the 'childAges' field is defined as an array of integers, and there is no indication in the specification that it can be null. Therefore, the invariant 'return.guests.childAges == null' is a false-positive.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive
Confidence: 1

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint /shopping/hotel-offers has a GET operation with a query parameter 'checkInDate' of type string and format date.
- The response schema includes a field 'self' of type string within an array under the 'data' field.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.checkInDate is a substring of return.self

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and found 9777 examples in the requests data, with 8348 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the checkInDate is indeed a substring of the return.self in the response.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the format of the 'self' field, and the examples provided support the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, as well as the semantic relevance of the invariant to the API specification, the invariant is classified as true-positive.

- The 'acceptedPayments' field contains an array of 'creditCards', each of which is a string.

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the 'creditCards' field in the response takes on one of two specific sequences of values.

The examples provided match the expected sequence of values for the 'creditCards' field, and the structure of the response does not contradict this invariant. Additionally, the number of calls made (50) and the number of distinct examples found (2) provide a reasonable level of confidence in the invariant.

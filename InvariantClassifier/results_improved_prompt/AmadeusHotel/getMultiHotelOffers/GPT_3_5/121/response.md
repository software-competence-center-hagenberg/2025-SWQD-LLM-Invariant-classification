## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation that returns a response with a nested structure.
- The response contains a field "data" which is an array of objects, each containing an "offers" field, which is also an array of objects.
- Each "offers" object has a field "roomQuantity" which is of type string and has a description indicating that it represents the number of rooms (1-9).

## Invariant
The invariant is that "return.roomQuantity" is Numeric.

## Analysis
The invariant is checking if the field "roomQuantity" in the response is always numeric. The provided examples of the variable values are all numeric, which aligns with the description in the Swagger definition that the field represents the number of rooms (1-9). The examples provided cover a range of values from 1 to 9, which further supports the likelihood of the field being numeric. Additionally, the large number of calls (10000) and the high number of distinct examples (8) provide strong evidence for the invariant holding true.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant "return.roomQuantity is Numeric" is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a 'get' operation that returns a response with a 'data' field containing an array of 'offers'. Each 'offer' has a 'policies' field, which in turn contains a 'cancellation' field with a 'description' field of type 'object'. This 'description' field has a 'text' field of type 'string' that represents free text.

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the 'text' field in the 'description' object is one of two specific values: "NON-REFUNDABLE RATE" or "Plus Taxes and fees where appropriate."

## Analysis
- We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample, indicating that the invariant holds for all the tested requests.
- We found 63 examples in the requests data, with 2 distinct examples, both of which match the expected values for the 'text' field.
- The invariant type 'OneOfString' is suitable for checking if a string variable takes on only a few distinct values, which aligns with the nature of the 'text' field.
- The examples provided match the expected values for the 'text' field, supporting the validity of the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant "return.data.offers.policies.cancellation.description.text one of { "NON-REFUNDABLE RATE", "Plus Taxes and fees where appropriate." }" is classified as a true-positive. The high number of tested calls, the absence of counterexamples, and the matching examples provide a high level of confidence in this classification.

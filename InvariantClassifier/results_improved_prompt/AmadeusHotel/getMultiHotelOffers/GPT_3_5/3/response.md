## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/shopping/hotel-offers"
- The response body contains a nested structure with the path "data.offers.price.variations.changes"
- The field of interest is "markups" within the nested structure

## Invariant
- The invariant is a unary scalar invariant of type OneOfScalar
- It checks if the field "markups" is null

## Analysis
- The invariant checks if the field "markups" is null, which means it expects the absence of markup information in the response
- The specification does not explicitly mention the presence of markup information, so the invariant is not contradicted by the specification
- The invariant has been tested with 10000 calls and no counterexamples were found
- The field "markups" is a nested field within the response body, and it makes semantic sense to check for its absence

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant "return.markups == null" is classified as a true-positive.

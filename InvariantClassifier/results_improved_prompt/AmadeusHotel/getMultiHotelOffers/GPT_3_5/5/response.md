## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a parameter "adults" in the query, which is an integer with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum length of 9.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with the field "acceptedPayments.methods" under "policies.deposit".

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.adults == size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[])
This means that the number of adult guests specified in the request should be equal to the number of accepted payment methods returned in the response.

## Analysis
- We have tried 50 calls on the API and found 2 distinct examples that satisfy the invariant.
- The examples provided are consistent with the invariant, where the number of adult guests matches the size of the accepted payment methods.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any other values for the "acceptedPayments.methods" field, and the invariant does not contradict the API specification.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the examples found, the invariant appears to be a true-positive. The examples are consistent with the invariant, and the specification does not provide any conflicting information. Therefore, the verdict is true-positive.

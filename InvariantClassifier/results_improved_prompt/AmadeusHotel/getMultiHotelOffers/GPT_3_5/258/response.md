## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a response schema that includes nested properties such as 'data', 'offers', 'policies', 'cancellation', and 'deposit'.
- The 'cancellation' property includes 'numberOfNights', which is an integer representing the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation.
- The 'deposit' property includes 'acceptedPayments', which is an object containing 'creditCards', an array of strings representing accepted payment card types.

## Invariant
The invariant is as follows:
- Invariant: size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]) % return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights == 0
- This invariant checks if the size of the 'creditCards' array is divisible by the 'numberOfNights' without a remainder.

## Analysis
Based on the provided example values:
- return.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights=1
- return.data.offers.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards=["VI","CA","AX","DC","IK","EC","XS"]

The 'numberOfNights' is 1, and the size of the 'creditCards' array is 7. Since 7 % 1 is not equal to 0, the invariant does not hold for this example.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided example and the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive. The example values contradict the invariant, indicating that the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the verdict is false-positive with a confidence of 1.

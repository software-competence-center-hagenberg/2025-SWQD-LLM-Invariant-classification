## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a response with a 'data' field, which contains an array of 'offers'. Each 'offer' has a 'price' field.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.price != null', which means that the 'price' field in the response should not be null.

## Analysis
- Based on the Swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to assume that the 'price' field in the response should not be null. This is consistent with the structure of the response as defined in the Swagger.
- The invariant has been tested with 10000 calls, and no counterexamples have been found. This suggests that the invariant holds for a large number of valid requests.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing, the invariant 'return.price != null' is classified as a true-positive.

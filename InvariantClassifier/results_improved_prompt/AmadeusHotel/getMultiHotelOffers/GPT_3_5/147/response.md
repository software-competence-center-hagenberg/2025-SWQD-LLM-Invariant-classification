## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response contains an array of hotel objects, each with a 'dupeId' field that represents the unique property identifier of the physical hotel.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the length of the 'dupeId' in the response is always 9 characters.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the large number of calls made (10000), it is highly likely that the invariant holds true. The examples provided show distinct 'dupeId' values, all of which are 9 characters in length. Additionally, the description of the 'dupeId' field in the Swagger definition does not indicate any variability in its length, supporting the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the consistency of the 'dupeId' length in the response data, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

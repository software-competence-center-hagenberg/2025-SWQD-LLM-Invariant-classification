## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a 'get' operation that returns a response with a 'data' field containing 'offers'.
- Each 'offer' has a 'price' field with 'variations' containing 'changes' representing price periods.
- The 'policies' field within 'offer' contains 'deposit' with 'acceptedPayments' and 'creditCards' representing accepted payment methods.

## Invariant
The invariant is a numeric divides invariant that checks if the size of 'creditCards' array minus 1 is divisible by the size of 'changes' array.

## Analysis
- The invariant compares the sizes of two arrays, 'creditCards' and 'changes', which are unrelated in the context of the API specification.
- There is no semantic relationship between the number of accepted payment methods and the number of price periods.
- The specification does not provide any indication that the size of 'creditCards' should be related to the size of 'changes'.
- The invariant does not align with the semantics of the API and appears to be a false-positive.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as a false-positive with high confidence.

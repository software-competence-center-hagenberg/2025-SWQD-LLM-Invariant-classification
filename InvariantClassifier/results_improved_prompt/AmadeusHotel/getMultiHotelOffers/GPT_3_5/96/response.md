## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a response with a 'data' field, which contains an array of objects.
- Each object in the array has a 'type' field of type string, representing the type of the object (hotel-offers).

## Invariant
The invariant is a unary string invariant that checks if the 'type' field in the 'data' array is equal to 'hotel-offers'.

## Analysis
- The invariant checks a specific value of the 'type' field in the response data.
- The swagger definition does not explicitly mention any other possible values for the 'type' field.
- The invariant has been tested with 10000 calls, and no counterexamples have been found.
- There are 16624 examples in the requests data, with 1 distinct example of the invariant holding.
- The example value of the variable 'return.data.type' is 'hotel-offers'.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.type == "hotel-offers"' is classified as a true-positive. The invariant has been extensively tested, and there is no evidence to suggest that it would not hold for every valid request on the API. The confidence in this classification is high.

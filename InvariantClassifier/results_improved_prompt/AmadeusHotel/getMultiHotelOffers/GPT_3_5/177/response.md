## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provided describes a REST endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response body contains a nested structure with properties such as 'room' and 'policies'. The 'room' property has a sub-property 'typeEstimated' with a 'beds' field, and the 'policies' property has a sub-property 'deposit' with a 'acceptedPayments' field containing an array of payment methods.

## Invariant
The invariant is a numeric divides invariant that checks if the number of beds in the room is divisible by the number of accepted payment methods without a remainder.

## Analysis
The invariant is applied to the 'beds' field of 'typeEstimated' under 'room' and the number of elements in the 'methods' array under 'acceptedPayments'. The invariant is evaluated based on 100 calls to the API, and no counterexamples were found. Additionally, 3 distinct examples are provided, demonstrating that the invariant holds true for these examples.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided information and the evaluation of 100 calls and 3 distinct examples, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

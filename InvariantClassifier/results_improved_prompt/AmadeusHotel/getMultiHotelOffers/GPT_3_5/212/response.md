## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a response with a 'data' field, which contains an array of 'offers'. Each 'offer' has a 'policies' field, which in turn has a 'cancellation' field with a 'description' field containing a 'lang' field.
- The 'lang' field is described as a string type with an example value of 'fr-FR'.

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the 'lang' field in the response is equal to 'EN'.

## Analysis
Based on the provided example value, the invariant 'return.data.offers.policies.cancellation.description.lang == "EN"' is a false-positive. The example value shows that the 'lang' field is 'EN', which means the invariant holds for this specific example. However, the specification does not explicitly state that the 'lang' field should always be 'EN'. Therefore, the invariant is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive
Confidence: 0.8

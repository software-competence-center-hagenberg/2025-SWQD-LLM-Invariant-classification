## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a response schema with nested properties.
- The 'policies.cancellation.numberOfNights' is an integer field representing the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation.
- The 'price.variations.changes' is an array of objects representing price periods with start date, end date, and price details.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a numeric divides invariant, checking if the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation is divisible by the size of the price variations changes array.
- The invariant is applied to the response body field 'return.data.offers'.

## Analysis
- 100 calls were made to the API, and no counterexamples were found, indicating that the invariant holds for all tested cases.
- 41 examples were found in the requests data, with 24 distinct examples, providing a good coverage of different input values.
- The examples show that the 'numberOfNights' is consistently 1, and the 'changes' array contains different price periods.
- The invariant is consistent with the semantics of the 'numberOfNights' and 'changes' array, as it makes sense for the number of nights due as a fee to be divisible by the number of price periods.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing, the invariant 'return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights % size(return.price.variations.changes[]) == 0' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

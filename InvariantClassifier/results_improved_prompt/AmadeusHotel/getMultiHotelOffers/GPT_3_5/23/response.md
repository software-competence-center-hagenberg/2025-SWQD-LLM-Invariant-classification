## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a response with a 'data' field containing an array of 'offers', each of which contains a 'room' object.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.room != null', which means that the 'room' object in each 'offer' must not be null.

## Analysis
- Based on the Swagger definition, the 'room' object is nested within the 'offer' object, and there is no indication in the specification that 'room' can be null. The invariant aligns with the structure of the response and the absence of null 'room' objects in the 10000 calls.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: true-positive
- Confidence: 0.9

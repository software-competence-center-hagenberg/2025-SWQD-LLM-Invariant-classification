## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a parameter "adults" in the query, which represents the number of adult guests per room.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with the field "acceptedPayments.methods" under "policies.deposit".

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.adults >= size(return.data.offers.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[])
This means that the number of adult guests should be greater than or equal to the number of accepted payment methods.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all the tested cases. The examples show that for different values of "input.adults", the size of "return.data.offers.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]" is always less than or equal to "input.adults".

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9
The invariant holds true for all tested cases, and the examples provide strong evidence that it holds for a range of input values. The semantic relationship between the variables also aligns with the domain logic, further supporting the classification as a true-positive.

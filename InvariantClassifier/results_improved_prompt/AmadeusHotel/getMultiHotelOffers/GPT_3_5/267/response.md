## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a parameter "adults" in the query, which is an integer with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum length of 9.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with the field "acceptedPayments.methods" containing an array of strings representing accepted payment methods.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.adults >= size(return.data.offers.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[])-1
This invariant checks if the number of adults is greater than or equal to the number of accepted payment methods minus 1.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all the tested cases. The examples cover a range of values for the "adults" parameter and different combinations of accepted payment methods. The invariant is consistent with the API specification, as the number of accepted payment methods directly relates to the number of adults.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a parameter "adults" in the query, which represents the number of adult guests per room.
- The response body contains a nested structure with the field "acceptedPayments.methods" under "policies.guarantee".

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.adults >= size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[])
This means that the number of adult guests should be greater than or equal to the number of accepted payment methods.

## Analysis
- The examples provided show that for different values of "input.adults", there are varying numbers of accepted payment methods in the response.
- The examples include cases where the invariant holds true, such as input.adults=5 and return.data.offers.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods=["CREDIT_CARD"], as well as input.adults=2 and return.data.offers.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods=["TRAVEL_AGENT_ID","CREDIT_CARD"].
- The invariant is consistent with the examples provided and holds true for all of them.
- The specification does not explicitly state any restrictions on the number of accepted payment methods based on the number of adult guests.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided examples and the absence of explicit constraints in the specification, the invariant "input.adults >= size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[])" is classified as a true-positive. The confidence level is high due to the consistency of the examples and the lack of contradictory information in the specification.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET method that returns a response with a 'data' array containing objects with a 'type' field and a 'hotel' object with a 'type' field.
- The 'type' field in the 'data' array is described as a string, and the 'type' field in the 'hotel' object is also described as a string.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.hotel.type is a substring of return.type

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'type' field in the 'data' array and the 'type' field in the 'hotel' object are both described as strings. The invariant checks if the 'hotel.type' is a substring of 'type'. Given the nature of string comparison, this invariant seems plausible and is supported by the example values provided.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing (10000 calls) with no counterexamples, I classify this invariant as a true-positive with high confidence.

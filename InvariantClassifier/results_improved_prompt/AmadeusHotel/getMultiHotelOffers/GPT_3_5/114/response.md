## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a response schema with a nested structure.
- The 'endDate' field is located at 'data.offers.price.variations.changes' in the response body.

## Invariant
- The invariant is that 'return.endDate' is a Date with the format YYYY/MM/DD.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided examples, the 'endDate' values are in the format YYYY-MM-DD, not YYYY/MM/DD as specified in the invariant.
- The invariant specifies a format that is not consistent with the actual format found in the response data.
- The specification does not explicitly mention the format of the 'endDate' field, so there is no contradiction there.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for the given API. The confidence in this classification is high due to the large number of examples and the clear contradiction between the specified format and the actual format found in the response data.

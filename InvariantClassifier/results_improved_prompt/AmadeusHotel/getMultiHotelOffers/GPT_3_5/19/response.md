## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a response with a 'data' field containing an array of 'offers'. Each 'offer' has a 'rateFamilyEstimated' field with a 'type' property of type string.
- The 'type' property is described as the type of the rate and is expected to match the pattern [PNC], indicating that it can take on the values 'P', 'N', or 'C'.

## Invariant
The invariant is checking that the 'type' property of 'rateFamilyEstimated' in the response is one of the values { "C", "P" }.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the pattern specified in the Swagger definition, the invariant appears to be a true-positive. The examples provided match the expected values of 'C' and 'P', and the pattern specified in the Swagger definition supports this constraint.

## Conclusion
Given the large number of calls made (10000) and the examples found (2 distinct examples), along with the consistency with the Swagger definition, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a REST endpoint with a response schema containing nested properties.
- The 'currency' field is defined as a string with a minimum length of 1 and a maximum length of 3.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the length of the 'currency' field in the response body is always 3.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the 'currency' field in the response body consistently has a length of 3 characters, which aligns with the invariant.

## Conclusion
Given the extensive testing with 10000 calls and the consistent examples found, it is highly likely that the invariant 'LENGTH(return.currency)==3' is a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is very high.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a response with a 'data' field, which contains an array of 'offers'. Each 'offer' has a 'policies' field, which contains a 'cancellation' field with a 'type' property.
- The 'type' property is a string with the description 'FULL_STAY' and an enum value of ['FULL_STAY'].

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the 'type' property in 'return.data.offers.policies.cancellation' is equal to 'FULL_STAY'.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the example values, the invariant 'return.data.offers.policies.cancellation.type == "FULL_STAY"' is a true-positive. The Swagger definition specifies that the 'type' property can only have the value 'FULL_STAY', and the example values confirm that this is the case. Additionally, the large number of calls (10000) and the high number of distinct examples (2886) provide strong evidence in support of the invariant holding true.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides a clear structure for the API endpoint, including the response schema and the location of the field in question.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the field `return.data.offers.policies.deposit.amount` is Numeric.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example, indicating that the invariant holds for a large number of calls.
- We found 36 examples in the requests data, with 1 of them being distinct examples, which provides some evidence that the invariant may hold for different inputs.
- The example value provided, `return.data.offers.policies.deposit.amount=0.00`, is a numeric value, which supports the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the example values, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is very high.

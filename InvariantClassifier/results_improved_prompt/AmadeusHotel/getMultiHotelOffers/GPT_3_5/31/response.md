## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a response with a 'data' field, which contains an array of 'offers'. Each 'offer' has a 'price' field, which contains 'markups' as an array of objects.
- The 'amount' field within 'markups' represents the monetary value with decimal precision as a string.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.price.markups == null

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'markups' field is an array of objects, and the invariant checks if this array is null. However, according to the specification, 'markups' is an array of objects representing markup information. It is not explicitly mentioned that 'markups' can be null, and it would not make sense for it to be null, as markup information is expected to be present for a hotel offer. Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive
Confidence: 0.9

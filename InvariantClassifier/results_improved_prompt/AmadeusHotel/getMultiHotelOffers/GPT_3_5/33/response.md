## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provided describes a REST endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response body contains a nested structure with price information, including variations in daily prices during a stay.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.price.variations.changes[] elements != null
This invariant specifies that all elements in the 'changes' array under 'variations' in the response body should not be null.

## Analysis
Based on the provided information, the invariant seems to be a true-positive. The invariant ensures that all elements in the 'changes' array are not null, which aligns with the expected structure of the response. Since 10000 calls have been made on the API without finding a single counter example, it is highly likely that this invariant holds true for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.95

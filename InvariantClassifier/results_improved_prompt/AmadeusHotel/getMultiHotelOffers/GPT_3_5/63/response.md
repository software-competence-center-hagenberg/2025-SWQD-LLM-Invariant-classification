## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a parameter 'roomQuantity' with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum length of 9.
- The response body contains an array of hotel offers, each with a 'price' field that includes 'taxes'.
- The 'taxes' field is an array of objects with various properties such as 'amount', 'currency', 'code', 'percentage', 'included', etc.

## Invariant

- The examples cover a range of roomQuantity values and tax arrays, supporting the validity of the invariant.

## Conclusion

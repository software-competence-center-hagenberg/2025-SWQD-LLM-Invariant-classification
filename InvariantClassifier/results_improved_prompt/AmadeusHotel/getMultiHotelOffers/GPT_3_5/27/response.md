- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a response with a 'data' field, which contains an array of 'offers', each of which contains a 'guests' field.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.guests != null', which means that the 'guests' field in the response should not be null.

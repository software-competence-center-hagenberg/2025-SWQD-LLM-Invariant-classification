## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "getMultiHotelOffers" takes a query parameter "hotelIds" which is an array of Amadeus property codes.
- The response contains a nested structure with the field "numberOfNights" under "policies.cancellation".

## Invariant
The invariant is that the value of "return.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights" is not equal to the size of "input.hotelIds[]".

## Analysis
- We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 6 distinct examples in the requests data, which cover a variety of hotelIds and corresponding numberOfNights.
- The examples show that the invariant holds true for the given data.
- The invariant makes semantic sense as the number of nights for cancellation can vary independently of the number of hotelIds.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the semantic relevance of the invariant, it is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

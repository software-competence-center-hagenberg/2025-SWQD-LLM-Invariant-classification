## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint "getMultiHotelOffers" returns a response with a nested structure containing price information and deposit/prepay policy information.
- The response includes an array of offers, each with price information and policies.
- The price information includes an array of taxes, each with specific properties such as amount, currency, code, percentage, included, description, pricingFrequency, and pricingMode.
- The deposit/prepay policy information includes accepted payments, which is an object containing an array of credit card types.

## Invariant
The invariant is a numeric divides invariant that checks if the size of the array of credit card types minus 1 is divisible by the size of the array of taxes in the response.

## Analysis
The invariant is comparing the sizes of two arrays in the response and checking if one is divisible by the other. The invariant seems to be related to the relationship between the number of credit card types and the number of taxes for an offer. It is possible that this relationship has some business logic or constraint behind it.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided information and the examples, the invariant seems to be a specific business rule related to the number of credit card types and taxes for an offer. Since 10000 calls were made and no counterexamples were found, and 91 distinct examples were observed, it is likely that the invariant is a true-positive.

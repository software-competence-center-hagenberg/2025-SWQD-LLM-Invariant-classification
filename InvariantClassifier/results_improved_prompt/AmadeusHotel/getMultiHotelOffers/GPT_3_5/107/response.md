## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET method with a parameter 'hotelIds' that is a mandatory array of strings.
- The response schema includes a 'data' field that is an array of objects.

## Invariant
The invariant is size(input.hotelIds[]) >= size(return.data[]), which means that the size of the 'hotelIds' array in the request should be greater than or equal to the size of the 'data' array in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to assume that the 'hotelIds' array in the request should correspond to the 'data' array in the response. Since the invariant has been tested with 10000 calls and no counterexamples have been found, it is highly likely that the invariant holds true for this API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.95

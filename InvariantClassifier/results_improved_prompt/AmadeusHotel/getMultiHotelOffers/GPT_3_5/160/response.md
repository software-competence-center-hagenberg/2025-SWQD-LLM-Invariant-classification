## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint /shopping/hotel-offers has a GET operation that returns a list of hotel offers.
- The response schema includes a 'data' array, where each item has a 'self' field of type string and a 'hotel' field of type object with a 'hotelId' field of type string.
- The 'hotelId' field has a pattern constraint that specifies it should be an 8-character string consisting of uppercase letters and digits.

## Invariant
The invariant is that return.hotel.hotelId is a substring of return.self.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the 'self' field in the response contains a URL, and the 'hotelId' field is a substring of the 'self' field. For example, in the first example, the 'hotelId' value 'HLOSA239' is present in the 'self' URL. This pattern holds for all the provided examples.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the provided examples and the response schema, the invariant return.hotel.hotelId is a substring of return.self is a true-positive. The examples demonstrate that the 'hotelId' is indeed a substring of the 'self' URL in the response, and this holds for all the tested cases. The confidence in this classification is high due to the large number of examples tested (10000 calls) and the consistency of the observed behavior.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint "getMultiHotelOffers" returns a response with a nested structure containing room offers and policies.
- The response structure includes the fields "room" and "policies", each with their own subfields.

## Invariant
The invariant is a comparison between the number of beds in a room ("return.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds") and the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation ("return.data.offers.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights"). The comparison is for greater than or equal to (>=).

## Analysis
- The invariant states that the number of beds in a room must be greater than or equal to the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation.
- The examples provided show values for the variables, with the number of beds being greater than the number of nights due as a fee in all cases.
- The invariant does not explicitly contradict the API specification.
- The invariant makes semantic sense in the context of hotel offers, as it relates to the capacity of the room and the cancellation policy.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided examples and the semantic relevance of the comparison, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a parameter "hotelIds" of type array in the query.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with the field "acceptedPayments.methods" under "policies.deposit".

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(input.hotelIds[])-1 % size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0
This invariant checks if the size of the array "input.hotelIds" minus 1 is divisible by the size of the array "return.data.offers.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods" without a remainder.

## Analysis
The invariant is comparing the sizes of two arrays, one from the request input and one from the response data. It ensures that the size of the input array "hotelIds" minus 1 is divisible by the size of the array "acceptedPayments.methods" in the response. The invariant is relevant to the structure of the request and response and does not contradict the API specification.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the examples provided, the invariant is classified as true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a response schema with a nested structure containing price information.
- The 'changes' field under 'variations' contains a collection of price periods if the daily price changes during the stay.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a lower bound scalar invariant, stating that the size of 'return.data.offers.price.variations.changes' should be greater than or equal to 1.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- We found 40692 examples in the requests data, with 16072 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the 'changes' field under 'variations' always contains at least one price period, supporting the invariant.
- The invariant is consistent with the structure of the response schema and the examples found in the requests data.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'size(return.price.variations.changes[]) >= 1' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint "getMultiHotelOffers" has a parameter "checkInDate" in the query, which represents the check-in date of the stay.
- The response body contains a nested structure under "data.offers.policies.holdTime.deadline", which represents the deadline for holding the booking.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.checkInDate is a substring of return.data.offers.policies.holdTime.deadline

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 297 examples in the requests data, with 9 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the check-in date is indeed a substring of the deadline in the response.
- The format of the check-in date matches the format of the deadline in the response.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the format of the check-in date or the deadline.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the examples found, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The examples provided and the absence of counterexamples give a high level of confidence in the correctness of the invariant.

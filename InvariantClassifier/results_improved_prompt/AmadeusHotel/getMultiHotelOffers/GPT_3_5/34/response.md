## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a response with a 'data' field, which contains an array of 'offers'. Each 'offer' contains an array of 'policies', which are objects representing booking rules.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.policies != null', which means that the 'policies' field within the 'offer' object should not be null in the response.

## Analysis
- Based on the Swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to expect that the 'policies' field should not be null, as it represents booking rules for an offer. This is consistent with the structure of the response defined in the Swagger.
- The fact that 500 calls were made on the API and no counterexamples were found provides strong evidence that the invariant holds true for this API.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the evidence from 500 calls, the invariant 'return.policies != null' is classified as a true-positive.

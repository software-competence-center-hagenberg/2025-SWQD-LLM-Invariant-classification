Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    price:
                      type: object
                      description: price information
                      properties:
                        variations:
                          type: object
                          description: Daily price variations and the average daily price (when available) is shown here
                          properties:
                            changes:
                              type: array
                              description: A collection of price periods if the daily price changes during the stay
                              items:
                                startDate:
                                  type: string
                                  description: Begin date of the period
                                  Format: YYYY-MM-DD


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.startDate is a Date. Format: YYYY/MM/DD

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.dates.IsDateYYYYMMDD
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable is always a date following the format YYYY/MM/DD or YYYY-MM-DD (the separator can be "/" or "-"). Represented as x is a Date. Format YYYY/MM/DD.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers.price.variations.changes" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 81961 examples in the requests data, with 11 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.data.offers.price.variations.changes.startDate=2022-09-27
return.data.offers.price.variations.changes.startDate=2022-09-28
return.data.offers.price.variations.changes.startDate=2022-09-25
return.data.offers.price.variations.changes.startDate=2022-09-26
return.data.offers.price.variations.changes.startDate=2022-09-29

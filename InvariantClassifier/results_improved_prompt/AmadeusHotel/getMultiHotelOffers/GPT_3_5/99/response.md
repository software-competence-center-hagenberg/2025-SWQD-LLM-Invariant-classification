## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a response with a 'data' field containing an array of hotels, each with a 'type' field.
- The 'type' field is defined as a string in the response schema.

## Invariant
The invariant is a unary string invariant that checks if the 'type' field of each hotel in the response is equal to 'hotel'.

## Analysis
Based on the provided information, the invariant 'return.hotel.type == "hotel"' seems to be a true-positive. The response schema specifies that the 'type' field is a string, and the invariant checks if it equals 'hotel'. The fact that 16624 examples in the requests data support this invariant, with 1 distinct example, provides strong evidence for its correctness.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

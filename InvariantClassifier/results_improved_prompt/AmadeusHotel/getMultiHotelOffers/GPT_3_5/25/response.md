## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides the structure of the API endpoint, including the response schema and the properties of the 'room' object.

## Invariant
- The invariant specifies that the value of 'return.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds' should be one of {1, 2}.

## Analysis
- We have tried 50 calls on this API and found 60 examples in the requests data, with 2 distinct examples of the variable 'return.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds'. Both examples have values of 1 and 2, which align with the invariant.
- The response schema does not explicitly mention other possible values for 'return.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds', and the invariant aligns with the type and description of the field in the response schema.
- The invariant is consistent with the semantics of the variable, as it restricts the possible values of the 'beds' field to 1 or 2, which makes sense in the context of room types.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds' one of {1, 2} is classified as a true-positive.

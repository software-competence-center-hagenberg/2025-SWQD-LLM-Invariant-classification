## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "getMultiHotelOffers" has a parameter "adults" in the query, which represents the number of adult guests per room.
- The response body contains a nested structure with the field "acceptedPayments.creditCards" under "data.offers.policies.guarantee".

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.adults <= size(return.data.offers.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards[])

## Analysis
- The invariant compares the number of adult guests with the size of the array of accepted credit cards.
- We have tried 500 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample.
- We found 153 examples in the requests data, with 52 of them being distinct examples.
- The example values of the variables show that the number of adult guests is consistently less than or equal to the size of the array of credit cards in the response.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any other values for the number of adult guests or the array of credit cards.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

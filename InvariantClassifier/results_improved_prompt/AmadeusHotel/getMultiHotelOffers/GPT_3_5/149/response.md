## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET method that returns a list of hotel offers.
- The response schema includes a 'data' field, which contains an array of hotels, each with a 'cityCode' field.
- The 'cityCode' field is described as a string with a pattern of ^[A-Z]{3}$, indicating that it should consist of three uppercase letters.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the length of the 'cityCode' in the response should always be 3.

## Analysis
- The response schema explicitly specifies the pattern for the 'cityCode' field, indicating that it should always be a 3-letter uppercase string.
- The examples provided in the request data also show that the 'cityCode' values consistently have a length of 3.
- The invariant aligns with the specification and the examples, and there are no counterexamples found in 10000 calls.

## Conclusion
Based on the alignment with the specification, the consistent examples, and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant 'LENGTH(return.hotel.cityCode)==3' is classified as a true-positive.

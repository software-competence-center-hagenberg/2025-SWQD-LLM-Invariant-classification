## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET method that returns a response with a 'data' field containing an array of 'offers'. Each 'offer' has a 'rateFamilyEstimated' field, which in turn has a 'type' field of type string.
- The 'type' field is described as the type of the rate, with a pattern constraint of [PNC] indicating that it should be one of the characters 'P', 'N', or 'C'.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the length of the 'type' field in the 'rateFamilyEstimated' object is always 1.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the description of the 'type' field, it is likely that the 'type' field will always have a length of 1, as it is constrained to be one of the characters 'P', 'N', or 'C'. The examples provided also support this, as they both have a length of 1.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a true-positive, with a high confidence due to the large number of examples and the nature of the 'type' field as described in the API specification.

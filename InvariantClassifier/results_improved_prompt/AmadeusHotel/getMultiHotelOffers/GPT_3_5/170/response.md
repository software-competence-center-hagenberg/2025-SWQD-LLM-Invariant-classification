## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a parameter "adults" of type integer, with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum length of 9.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with the field "acceptedPayments.methods" containing an array of strings.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.adults % size(return.data.offers.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the number of adult guests is divisible by the size of the array of accepted payment methods for a hotel offer. The examples provided are:
1. input.adults=1; return.data.offers.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods=["CREDIT_CARD"]
2. input.adults=2; return.data.offers.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods=["CREDIT_CARD","ADVANCE_DEPOSIT"]
3. input.adults=2; return.data.offers.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods=["CREDIT_CARD"]

From the examples, it seems that the invariant holds true for the given data. The invariant ensures that the number of adult guests is evenly divisible by the number of accepted payment methods, which aligns with the business logic of hotel offers.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

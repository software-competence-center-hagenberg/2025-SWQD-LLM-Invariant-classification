## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation that returns a response with a nested structure.
- The response contains an array of hotel offers, each with properties including policies for cancellation and guarantee.
- The cancellation policy includes the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation.
- The guarantee policy includes information about accepted payments, with a list of accepted payment methods.

## Invariant
- The invariant is a numerical constraint that checks if the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation is divisible by the number of accepted payment methods.
- The invariant is represented as: return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights % size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0

## Analysis

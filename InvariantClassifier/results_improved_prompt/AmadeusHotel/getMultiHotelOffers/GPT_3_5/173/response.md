## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' returns a response with a nested structure containing 'data', 'offers', 'room', 'typeEstimated', 'beds', and 'policies' fields.
- The 'beds' field represents the number of beds in the room, and the 'numberOfNights' field represents the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation.

## Invariant
The invariant is as follows:
return.room.typeEstimated.beds % return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights == 0
This invariant checks if the number of beds in the room is divisible by the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for all the examples. The invariant is a mathematical check to see if the number of beds is divisible by the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation. Since the examples provided satisfy this condition, and we have tried 500 calls without finding a single counterexample, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

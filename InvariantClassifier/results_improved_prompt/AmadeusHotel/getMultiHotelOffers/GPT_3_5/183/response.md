## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation that returns an array of hotel offers.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with properties such as "policies" and "price.variations.changes".

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.price.variations.changes[])-1 % return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights == 0
This invariant checks if the size of the array "return.price.variations.changes" minus 1 is divisible by the value of "return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights" without a remainder.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the response, the invariant seems to hold true for the given data. The examples show that for each distinct value of "return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights", the size of "return.price.variations.changes[]" minus 1 is indeed divisible by that value without a remainder. The structure of the response also supports this relationship between the two fields.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.9

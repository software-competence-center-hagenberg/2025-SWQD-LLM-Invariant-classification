- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a response schema containing a field "data" which is an array of objects.
- Each object in the array has a field "self" of type string.

## Invariant

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and found 16624 examples in the requests data, with 14204 of them being distinct examples.
- All 14204 distinct examples of the field "self" in the response data are URLs.
- The example values provided are valid URLs.
- The specification does not explicitly mention other possible values for the field "self".

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, the invariant that the field "self" in the response data is always a URL is likely a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is high.

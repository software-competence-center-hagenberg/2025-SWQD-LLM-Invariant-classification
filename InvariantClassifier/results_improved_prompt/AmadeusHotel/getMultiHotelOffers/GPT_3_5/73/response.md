## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a response schema with nested properties.
- The 'data' field contains an array of 'offers', each with 'price' and 'policies' properties.
- The 'price' property contains 'variations' with 'average' containing 'total'.
- The 'policies' property contains 'deposit' with 'acceptedPayments' containing 'creditCards'.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the value of 'return.price.variations.average.total' is always a member of the sequence 'return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]'.

## Analysis
Given that we have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example, it is highly likely that this invariant is a true-positive. The structure of the response schema and the absence of counterexamples provide strong evidence for the correctness of the invariant.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Confidence: 0.95

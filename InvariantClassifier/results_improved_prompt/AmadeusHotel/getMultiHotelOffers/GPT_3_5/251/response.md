## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/shopping/hotel-offers"
- The response body contains a nested structure with the field "data.offers.policies.cancellation.description.lang"

## Invariant

## Analysis
- The example value provided for the variable is "EN", which indeed has a length of 2, satisfying the invariant.
- The invariant is based on the length of the language code, and it is reasonable to expect language codes to have a fixed length of 2.
- The large number of calls (10000) and the 119 examples in the requests data, with 1 distinct example, provide strong evidence in favor of the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

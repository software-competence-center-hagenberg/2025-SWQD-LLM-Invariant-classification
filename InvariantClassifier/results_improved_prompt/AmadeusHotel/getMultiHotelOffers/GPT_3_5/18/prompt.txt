Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    checkInDate:
                      type: string
                      description: check-in date of the stay (hotel local date). Format YYYY-MM-DD
                      The lowest accepted value is today date (no dates in the past).
                      example: Wed Dec 30 01:00:00 CET 2020


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: "return.checkInDate one of { ""2022-09-20"", ""2022-09-21"", ""2022-09-22"" }"

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.OneOfString
Invariant description: Represents String variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 41891 examples in the requests data, with 3 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 3 example values of the variables:
return.data.offers.checkInDate=2022-09-22
return.data.offers.checkInDate=2022-09-21
return.data.offers.checkInDate=2022-09-20

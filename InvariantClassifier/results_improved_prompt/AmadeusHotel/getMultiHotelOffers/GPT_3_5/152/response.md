## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "getMultiHotelOffers" has a parameter "checkOutDate" of type string in the query.
- The response schema includes a field "self" of type string within an array under the "data" field.

## Invariant
- The invariant is: input.checkOutDate is a substring of return.self
- Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString
- Invariant description: Represents the substring invariant between two String scalars. Prints as x is a substring of y.
- Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
- Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
- The return fields refer to the path "data" in the response body.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- We found 9386 examples in the requests data, with 8042 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the checkOutDate is indeed a substring of the return.self for each request.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the format of the return.self field.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, it is highly likely that the invariant "input.checkOutDate is a substring of return.self" is a true-positive for this REST API endpoint.

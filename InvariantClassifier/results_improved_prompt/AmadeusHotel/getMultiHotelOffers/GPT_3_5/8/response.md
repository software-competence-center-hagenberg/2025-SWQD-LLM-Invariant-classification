## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint "getMultiHotelOffers" has a parameter "boardType" in the query, which is a string type.
- The response schema includes a field "data.offers.boardType" which is also a string type.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.boardType == return.data.offers.boardType

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the input boardType is equal to the boardType in the response data. The examples provided show that for the given input boardType values (BREAKFAST and ROOM_ONLY), the corresponding return data offers have the same boardType values.

- The enum values for boardType in the response are consistent with the values that can be provided in the input boardType parameter.
- The examples provided cover a reasonable range of input boardType values and show that the invariant holds for those cases.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided examples and the consistency between the input and return boardType values, it is likely that the invariant is a true-positive. The examples cover a reasonable range of input values, and the specification does not explicitly contradict the invariant. Therefore, the verdict is true-positive with a high confidence.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint "getMultiHotelOffers" has a parameter "hotelIds" of type array in the query.
- The response body contains a nested structure with the field "data.offers.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods".

## Invariant
- The invariant is a numeric divides invariant that checks if the size of the input hotelIds array minus 1 is divisible by the size of the return acceptedPayments methods array.
- The invariant is represented as: size(input.hotelIds[])-1 % size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0

## Analysis
- We have tried 100 calls on the API and found 20 distinct examples of the invariant holding.
- The examples provided in the request data show that for each input hotelIds array, the size of the array minus 1 is indeed divisible by the size of the return acceptedPayments methods array.
- The examples cover a variety of input hotelIds arrays and corresponding return acceptedPayments methods arrays.
- There is no explicit contradiction in the API specification that would invalidate this invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the examples found, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

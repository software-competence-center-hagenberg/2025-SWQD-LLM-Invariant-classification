## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint returns a response with a nested structure containing offers, policies, deposit, and cancellation information.
- The 'acceptedPayments' field contains a sequence of accepted payment methods.
- The 'type' field under 'cancellation' is a string with a specific set of allowed values.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the 'cancellation' type should be a member of the accepted payment methods.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, it is unlikely that the 'cancellation' type would be a member of the accepted payment methods. The 'cancellation' type and the accepted payment methods are semantically different and are not related in a way that would make this invariant hold true for every valid request.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a false-positive with high confidence.

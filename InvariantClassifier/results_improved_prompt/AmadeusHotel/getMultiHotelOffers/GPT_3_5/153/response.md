## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint /shopping/hotel-offers has a query parameter 'countryOfResidence' that takes a string value in ISO 3166-1 format.
- The response schema includes a field 'self' within the 'data' array, which is of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.countryOfResidence is a substring of return.self

## Analysis
The invariant states that the value of 'countryOfResidence' in the request is a substring of the 'self' field in the response. This means that the country code provided in the request should be present within the 'self' URL in the response.

Given the nature of the 'self' field in the response, which contains a URL, it is reasonable to expect that the country code of residence would be present in the URL if it is provided in the request. The examples provided also support this expectation.

The 10000 calls made to the API did not yield a single counterexample, and 7511 examples were found in the requests data, with 6457 distinct examples. The examples provided also demonstrate that the invariant holds true for the given data.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the extensive testing, the invariant 'input.countryOfResidence is a substring of return.self' is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

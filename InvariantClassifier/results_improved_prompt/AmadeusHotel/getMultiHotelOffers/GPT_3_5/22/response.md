## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a REST endpoint for retrieving hotel offers.
- The response schema includes a field 'boardType' which is a string with a defined set of enum values.

## Invariant
The invariant is "return.boardType one of { ""BREAKFAST"", ""ROOM_ONLY"" }". It specifies that the 'boardType' in the response should be either "BREAKFAST" or "ROOM_ONLY".

## Analysis
- The response schema explicitly defines the enum values for 'boardType', and the invariant aligns with these defined values.
- The examples provided in the request data also match the expected values of 'boardType' as per the invariant.
- The invariant has been tested with 100 calls and found to hold true for all of them.

## Conclusion
Based on the alignment with the response schema, the matching examples, and the extensive testing, the invariant is classified as a true-positive.

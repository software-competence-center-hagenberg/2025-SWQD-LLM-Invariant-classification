Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    boardType:
                      type: string
                      description: The included Breakfast/Meals
                      enum: [ROOM_ONLY, BREAKFAST, HALF_BOARD, FULL_BOARD, ALL_INCLUSIVE, BUFFET_BREAKFAST, CARIBBEAN_BREAKFAST, CONTINENTAL_BREAKFAST, ENGLISH_BREAKFAST, FULL_BREAKFAST, DINNER_BED_AND_BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER, FAMILY_PLAN, AS_BROCHURED, SELF_CATERING, BERMUDA, AMERICAN, FAMILY_AMERICAN, MODIFIED]


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: "return.boardType one of { ""BREAKFAST"", ""ROOM_ONLY"" }"

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.OneOfString
Invariant description: Represents String variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 123 examples in the requests data, with 2 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 2 example values of the variables:
return.data.offers.boardType=ROOM_ONLY
return.data.offers.boardType=BREAKFAST

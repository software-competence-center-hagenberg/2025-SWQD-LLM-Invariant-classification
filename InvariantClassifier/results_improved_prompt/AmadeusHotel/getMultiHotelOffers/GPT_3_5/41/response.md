## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a response with a 'data' field, which contains an array of 'offers'. Each 'offer' has a 'policies' field, which contains a 'prepay' field.

## Invariant
The invariant is that 'return.policies.prepay' is always null.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition, there is no explicit mention of 'return.policies.prepay' being always null. The description of the 'prepay' field indicates that it includes information about the deposit/prepay policy, but it does not specify that it can never be null. Without further information, it is not clear whether 'prepay' can be null or not.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.policies.prepay == null' is a false-positive. The confidence level is high because the Swagger definition does not provide enough evidence to support the invariant, and the description of the 'prepay' field suggests that it may not always be null.

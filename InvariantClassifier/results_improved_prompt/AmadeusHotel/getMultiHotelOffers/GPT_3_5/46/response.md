## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a response with a 'data' field containing an array of 'offers'. Each 'offer' has a 'policies' field, which in turn has a 'cancellation' field with a 'numberOfNights' property.

## Invariant
- The invariant specifies that the 'numberOfNights' property in the response must be either 1 or 3.

## Analysis
- We have tried 100 calls on this API and found 43 examples in the requests data, with 2 distinct examples. Both of these examples have the 'numberOfNights' property set to either 1 or 3, which supports the invariant.
- The specification does not explicitly mention other possible values for 'numberOfNights', and the invariant aligns with the semantics of the variable.

## Conclusion
- Based on the analysis and the absence of counterexamples in the sample data, along with the alignment with the specification and the semantics of the variable, the invariant is classified as a true-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint /shopping/hotel-offers has a response schema that includes a nested structure with the field 'percentage' under 'taxes'.

## Invariant
- The invariant is that return.percentage is Numeric, which means that the 'percentage' field under 'taxes' is always expected to be numeric.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- There are 12472 examples in the requests data, with 15 distinct examples, all of which have numeric values for the 'percentage' field.
- The example values provided (e.g., 19.00, 20.00, 14.95) are all numeric.
- The specification does not explicitly mention non-numeric values for the 'percentage' field.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, along with the consistent numeric values found in the examples, it is highly likely that the invariant return.percentage is Numeric is a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is very high.

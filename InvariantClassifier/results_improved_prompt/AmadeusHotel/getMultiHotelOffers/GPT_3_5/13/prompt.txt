    parameters:

                      type: object
                      description: Specific type to convey a list of string for specific information type ( via qualifier) in specific character set, or language

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.description == return.policies.deposit.description

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two long scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

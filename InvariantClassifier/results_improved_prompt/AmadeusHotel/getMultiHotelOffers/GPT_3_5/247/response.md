## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a 'get' operation for the '/shopping/hotel-offers' endpoint, which returns an array of hotel objects with a 'latitude' property.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.hotel.latitude != 0' specifies that the latitude of the hotel should not be equal to 0.

## Analysis
- After testing the API with 10000 calls and finding no counterexamples, it is highly likely that the invariant holds true for this API. The 16406 examples found in the requests data, with 258 distinct examples, provide strong evidence in support of the invariant. The examples of latitude values provided also confirm that the latitude values are non-zero.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: true-positive
- Confidence: 0.95

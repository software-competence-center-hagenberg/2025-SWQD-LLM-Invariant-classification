## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation that returns a list of hotel offers.
- The response schema includes a field "data" which contains an array of hotels, each with a "hotelId" and a "chainCode".
- The "hotelId" is a string with a pattern of 8 characters, and the "chainCode" is a string with a pattern of 2 uppercase characters.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the "chainCode" of a hotel is a substring of the "hotelId" of the same hotel.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.
- There are 16624 examples in the requests data, with 262 distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the "chainCode" is indeed a substring of the "hotelId" for all the examples.
- The pattern of the "hotelId" and "chainCode" aligns with the invariant, as the "chainCode" is always a substring of the "hotelId" based on the provided examples.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the alignment of the examples with the invariant, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive.

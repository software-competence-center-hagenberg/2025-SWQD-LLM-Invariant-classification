## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a response schema with a nested structure.
- The 'acceptedPayments' object contains a 'methods' array of strings, representing accepted payment methods.

## Invariant
The invariant is as follows:
"return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[] elements one of { ""ADVANCE_DEPOSIT"", ""CREDIT_CARD"" }"
This means that the 'methods' array in 'acceptedPayments' should only contain the values "ADVANCE_DEPOSIT" or "CREDIT_CARD".

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples, the invariant holds true for the given responses. Both examples contain the expected values of "CREDIT_CARD" and "ADVANCE_DEPOSIT" in the 'methods' array.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the response schema, the invariant is classified as true-positive. The examples cover the possible values for the 'methods' array, and the structure of the response does not contradict the invariant.

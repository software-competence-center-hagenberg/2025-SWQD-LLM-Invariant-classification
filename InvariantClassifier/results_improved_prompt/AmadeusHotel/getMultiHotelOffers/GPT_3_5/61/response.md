- We found 35 examples in the requests data, with 12 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided include values where input.roomQuantity is greater than or equal to return.data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds.
- The invariant makes semantic sense in the context of the API, as it checks if the requested number of rooms is sufficient to accommodate the number of beds in the returned room.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the examples, the invariant "input.roomQuantity >= return.room.typeEstimated.beds" is classified as a true-positive. The confidence in this classification is high due to the large number of examples and the semantic relevance of the invariant to the API context.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a parameter "adults" in the query with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum length of 9.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with the field "acceptedPayments.methods" containing an array of strings representing accepted payment methods.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.adults % size(return.data.offers.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0
This invariant checks if the number of adults is divisible by the size of the array of accepted payment methods.

## Analysis
- We have tried 100 calls on this API and did not find a single counterexample, indicating that the invariant holds for all tested cases.
- We found 20 examples in the requests data, with 6 of them being distinct examples, which provides a good variety of test cases.
- The examples provided show different values for the number of adults and different arrays of accepted payment methods, all of which satisfy the invariant.
- The invariant aligns with the semantics of the variables, as it checks the divisibility of the number of adults by the number of accepted payment methods, which is a meaningful relationship in the context of hotel bookings.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the meaningful relationship between the variables, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

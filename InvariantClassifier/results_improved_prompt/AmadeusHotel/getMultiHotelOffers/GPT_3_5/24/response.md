## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a response with a 'data' field, which contains an array of 'offers'. Each 'offer' has a 'room' field, which in turn has a 'typeEstimated' field.

## Invariant
The invariant is that 'return.room.typeEstimated' is not null.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, it is reasonable to assume that the 'typeEstimated' field in the 'room' object should not be null. This is because the description of the field indicates that it provides information about the room category, bed type, and number of beds, and it is unlikely that this information would be null for a valid response.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a true-positive. The confidence level is high given that 100 calls have been made on the API without finding a single counterexample.

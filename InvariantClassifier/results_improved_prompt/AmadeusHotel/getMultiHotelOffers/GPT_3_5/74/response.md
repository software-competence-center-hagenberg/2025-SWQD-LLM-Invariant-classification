## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' returns a response with a nested structure containing price information and booking rules.
- The 'price' object contains 'variations' which in turn contains 'average' with a 'total' property.
- The 'policies' object contains 'deposit' with 'acceptedPayments' which is an array of accepted payment methods.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the 'total' price in the 'average' object is always a member of the array of accepted payment methods.

## Analysis
Based on the provided swagger definition and the invariant, it seems unlikely that the 'total' price in the 'average' object would be a member of the array of accepted payment methods. The 'total' price is a monetary value, while the accepted payment methods are strings representing different payment methods. There is no semantic relationship between these two values, and it is unlikely that a monetary value would be a member of an array of payment method strings.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a false-positive, as it is unlikely to hold for every valid request on the API. The confidence level is high due to the semantic mismatch between the 'total' price and the accepted payment methods.

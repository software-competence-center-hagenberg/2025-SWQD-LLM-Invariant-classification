## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint /shopping/hotel-offers has a parameter 'lang' of type string with a pattern constraint of ^[a-zA-Z0-9-]{2,5}$
- The response contains a field 'self' under 'data.offers' of type string

## Invariant
The invariant is that input.lang is a substring of return.self

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and found 24499 examples in the requests data, with 21608 of them being distinct examples
- The examples provided show that the 'lang' parameter is indeed a substring of the 'self' field in the response
- The pattern constraint on 'lang' ensures that it consists of alphanumeric characters and hyphens, which aligns with the examples found in the response
- The examples cover a wide range of valid language codes and their corresponding 'self' links

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the alignment of the examples with the pattern constraint, it is highly likely that the invariant is a true-positive.

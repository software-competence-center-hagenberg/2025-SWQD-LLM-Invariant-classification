Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    rateFamilyEstimated:
                      type: object
                      description: The estimated rate code family of the offer. Grouping various rate plan codes that belongs to the same family and indicates the type of the rate
                      properties:
                        code:
                          type: string
                          description: The estimated rate family (PRO,FAM,GOV)
                          pattern: [A-Z0-9]{3}


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.rateFamilyEstimated.code)==3

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

We have tried 10000 calls on this API and did not find a single counter example.

We found 25855 examples in the requests data, with 11 of them being distinct examples.
Here are 5 example values of the variables:
return.data.offers.rateFamilyEstimated.code=GOV
return.data.offers.rateFamilyEstimated.code=PRO
return.data.offers.rateFamilyEstimated.code=RAC
return.data.offers.rateFamilyEstimated.code=SRS
return.data.offers.rateFamilyEstimated.code=PKG

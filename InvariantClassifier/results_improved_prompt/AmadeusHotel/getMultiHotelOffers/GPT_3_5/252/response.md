## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a list of hotel offers.
- The response schema includes a 'data' field, which contains an array of offers.
- Each offer has a 'commission' field, which contains an 'amount' field representing the commission paid to the travel seller.
- The 'amount' field is of type string and is always linked to the currency code of the offer.

## Invariant
The invariant is "return.commission.amount one of { "1.78", "2.74" }", which specifies that the 'amount' field in the 'commission' object should be either "1.78" or "2.74".

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the description of the 'amount' field, it is reasonable to assume that the commission amount can take on specific values linked to the currency code of the offer. The examples provided match the expected values specified in the invariant.

## Conclusion
I classify this invariant as a true-positive, as it holds for the examples tested and aligns with the expected behavior of the 'amount' field in the 'commission' object. The confidence level is high due to the large number of calls made (10000) and the examples found (173 with 2 distinct values).

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provided describes a REST endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response body contains an array of hotel objects, each with latitude and longitude properties.

## Invariant
The invariant is that return.hotel.latitude != return.hotel.longitude, indicating that the latitude and longitude of a hotel should not be equal.

## Analysis
Based on the provided examples and the nature of latitude and longitude coordinates, it is highly unlikely that the latitude and longitude of a hotel would be exactly equal. The examples provided also demonstrate a wide range of distinct latitude and longitude values, supporting the likelihood of the invariant holding true.

## Conclusion
Given the nature of latitude and longitude coordinates, the large number of examples, and the absence of any counterexamples in 10000 calls, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a true-positive with high confidence.

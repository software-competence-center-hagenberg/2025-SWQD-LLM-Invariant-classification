## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers.
- The response schema includes a field 'chainCode' which is a string with a pattern constraint of exactly 2 uppercase letters.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the length of the 'chainCode' in the response is always 2.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on the API and did not find a single counterexample, indicating that the invariant holds for a large number of calls.
- We found 16624 examples in the requests data, with 43 distinct examples, which suggests that the invariant is likely to hold for a variety of input values.
- The example values provided for 'chainCode' all have a length of 2, which supports the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the absence of counterexamples, as well as the variety of input values and the example values provided, the invariant is classified as a true-positive with high confidence.

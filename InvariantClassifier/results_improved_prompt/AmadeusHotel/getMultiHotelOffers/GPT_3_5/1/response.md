## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a response with a 'data' field containing 'offers', which in turn contains 'price' and 'taxes' fields.
- The 'pricingMode' field is a string within the 'taxes' array, and it specifies if the tax applies per occupant or per room.

## Invariant
The invariant is that the 'pricingMode' field in the response should be one of { "PER_OCCUPANT", "PER_PRODUCT" }.

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and found 2 distinct examples of the 'pricingMode' field, both of which are valid according to the invariant.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any other possible values for the 'pricingMode' field, and the invariant aligns with the semantic meaning of the field.
- The invariant is a simple string comparison, and the examples found in the requests data support the validity of the invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the extensive testing and the semantic alignment of the invariant with the field's meaning, the invariant "return.pricingMode one of { "PER_OCCUPANT", "PER_PRODUCT" }" is classified as a true-positive.

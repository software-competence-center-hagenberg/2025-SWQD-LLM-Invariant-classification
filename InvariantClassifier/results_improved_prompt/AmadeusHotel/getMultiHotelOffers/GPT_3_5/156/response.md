## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint "getMultiHotelOffers" has a parameter "boardType" of type string in the query.
- The response schema includes a field "self" of type string within an array under the "data" field.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.boardType is a substring of return.self

## Analysis
- We have tried 10000 calls on this API and found 3998 examples in the requests data, with 3395 of them being distinct examples.
- The examples provided show that the boardType value is indeed a substring of the return.self value in the response.
- The specification does not explicitly mention any restrictions on the format of the return.self value, so the invariant seems to hold for the observed examples.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant seems to be a true-positive as it holds for the observed examples and is not contradicted by the specification. The confidence in this classification is high due to the large number of examples and the absence of any contradicting information in the specification.

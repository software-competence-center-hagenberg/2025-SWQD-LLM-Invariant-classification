## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The Swagger definition contains a GET endpoint at the path "/" with a response schema that includes a property "Search" of type array.
- Each item in the array has a property "Poster" of type string with an example URL.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the field "Poster" in the response body is always a URL.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided Swagger definition, the example value for the field "Poster" is a URL, which suggests that the API intends to return a URL for the "Poster" field.
- However, the example value alone does not guarantee that every response will always contain a URL for the "Poster" field. The invariant assumes that the field will always be a URL, which may not be enforced by the API implementation.

## Conclusion
- The invariant is a false-positive because the example value in the Swagger definition does not guarantee that every response will adhere to the invariant. The API implementation may allow non-URL values for the "Poster" field, making the invariant incorrect.

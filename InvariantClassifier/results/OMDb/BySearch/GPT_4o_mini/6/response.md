### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at the root path ("/") that returns a response with a schema containing a property called `totalResults`. This property is defined as a string, with an example value of `2`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.totalResults` is Numeric, which is defined as the characters of a string variable being always numeric. 

### Analysis
1. **Type of `totalResults`:** The Swagger definition specifies that `totalResults` is of type `string`. This means that the value can include any characters that are valid in a string, not just numeric characters. 
2. **Example Value:** While the example value provided is `2`, which is numeric, it does not guarantee that all possible values of `totalResults` will be numeric. For instance, if the API were to return a value like `"abc"` or `"2.5"`, it would still be a valid string but not numeric according to the invariant's definition. 
3. **String Flexibility:** Since `totalResults` is a string, it can represent a variety of values, including non-numeric ones, which directly contradicts the invariant that states it must always be numeric.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant claims that `return.totalResults` is always numeric, but the Swagger definition allows for `totalResults` to be a string which can include non-numeric characters, the invariant is incorrect. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

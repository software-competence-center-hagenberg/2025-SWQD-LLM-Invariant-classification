The invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant input.y > size(return.Ratings[]) assumes that the input parameter 'y' is related to the size of the 'Ratings' array in the response. However, the 'y' parameter is not directly related to the size of the 'Ratings' array. It is used as a filter for the search and does not determine the size of the 'Ratings' array in the response. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

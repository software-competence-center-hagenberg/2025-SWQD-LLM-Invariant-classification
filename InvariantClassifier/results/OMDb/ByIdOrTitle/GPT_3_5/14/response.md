## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition includes a GET endpoint at the path "/" with a response schema containing a property "Episode" of type string and example value "4".

## Invariant
- The invariant is "return.Episode is Numeric", which indicates that the property "Episode" in the response body should always contain a numeric value.

## Analysis
- The response schema specifies the type of the "Episode" property as string, and the example value provided is "4", which is a numeric string. However, the invariant does not guarantee that the property will always contain a numeric value, as the schema allows for any string value.

## Conclusion
- The invariant "return.Episode is Numeric" is a false-positive, as it does not hold for every valid request on the API. The response schema allows for any string value, not just numeric ones.

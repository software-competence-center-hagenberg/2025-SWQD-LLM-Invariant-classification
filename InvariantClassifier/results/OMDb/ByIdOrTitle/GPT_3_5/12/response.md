## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition contains a GET endpoint at "/" with a response schema that includes the field "imdbVotes" of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant is "return.imdbVotes is Numeric", which checks if the field "imdbVotes" in the response is always numeric.

## Analysis
- The response schema specifies the type of "imdbVotes" as a string, and the example value provided is a string ("370,080"). Therefore, the invariant "return.imdbVotes is Numeric" is false-positive because the response allows non-numeric characters in the "imdbVotes" field.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- The endpoint has a GET operation at the path '/' with a summary 'Search'.
- The response schema for the '200' status code includes a property 'imdbRating' of type 'string' with an example value of '6.6'.

### Invariant

- The invariant 'return.imdbRating is Numeric' checks if the 'imdbRating' field in the response is always numeric.

### Analysis

- The response schema specifies the 'imdbRating' property as a string, and the example value '6.6' is also a string.
- The invariant 'return.imdbRating is Numeric' expects the 'imdbRating' to always be numeric, which is not the case based on the response schema.

### Conclusion

- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant 'return.imdbRating is Numeric' is a false-positive because the response schema defines 'imdbRating' as a string, and the example value provided is also a string, not a numeric value.

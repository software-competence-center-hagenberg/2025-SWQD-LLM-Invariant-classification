## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint has a GET operation at the path "/" with a summary of "Search".
- The response schema for the 200 status code includes a property "totalSeasons" of type string with an example value of "2".

## Invariant
- The invariant is "return.totalSeasons is Numeric", which means that the value of "totalSeasons" in the response must always be numeric.

## Analysis
- The response schema specifies the type of "totalSeasons" as string, and the example value is also a string ("2").
- Since the response schema explicitly defines the type of "totalSeasons" as string, the invariant "return.totalSeasons is Numeric" is false-positive, as it will not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
Based on the response schema, the invariant "return.totalSeasons is Numeric" is a false-positive.

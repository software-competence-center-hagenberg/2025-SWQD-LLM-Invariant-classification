## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition contains a GET endpoint at the path "/" with a response schema that includes a property "Season" of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking if the field "Season" in the response is numeric.

## Analysis
- The response schema defines the "Season" property as a string, but the invariant is checking if it is numeric. This means that the invariant is checking for a different type than what is actually defined in the schema.
- Since the response schema explicitly defines the "Season" property as a string, the invariant is false-positive.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive

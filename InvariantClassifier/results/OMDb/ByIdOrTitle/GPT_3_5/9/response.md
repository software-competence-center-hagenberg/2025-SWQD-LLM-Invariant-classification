### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition contains a GET endpoint at the root path ('/'). The response to this endpoint includes a 'Poster' property with a type of string and an example value that is a URL.

### Invariant

The invariant states that the value of 'return.Poster' is always a URL.

### Analysis

Based on the provided Swagger definition, the example value for 'Poster' is indeed a URL. However, the example value alone does not guarantee that every response will always contain a URL in the 'Poster' field. The example value is just one possible representation and does not enforce the invariant for all valid responses.

### Conclusion

The invariant is a false-positive. The example value provided in the Swagger definition does not ensure that 'return.Poster' is always a URL for every valid response. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

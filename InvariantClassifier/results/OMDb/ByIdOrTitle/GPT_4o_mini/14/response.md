### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at the root path ("/") that returns a response with a schema containing a property named `Episode`. The `Episode` property is defined as a string type with an example value of "4".

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.Episode` is Numeric, which implies that the value of `Episode` should always consist of numeric characters.

### Analysis
1. **Type Definition**: The `Episode` property is defined as a string in the Swagger definition. This means that while it can contain numeric characters, it can also contain non-numeric characters (e.g., letters, symbols).
2. **Example Value**: The example provided is "4", which is numeric. However, the example does not restrict the possible values of `Episode` to only numeric strings. Other values such as "Episode 4", "4A", or even an empty string are valid string values but are not numeric.
3. **General Case**: Since the type is defined as a string, there is no guarantee that all valid responses will have `Episode` as a numeric string. Therefore, the invariant that `return.Episode` is always numeric does not hold for every valid request.

### Conclusion
Given that the definition allows for `Episode` to be a string without enforcing it to be numeric, the invariant is incorrect. Thus, the invariant is classified as a false-positive.

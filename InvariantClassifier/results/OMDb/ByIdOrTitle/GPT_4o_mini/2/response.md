### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at the root path ("/") that returns a response with a schema defined as an object containing a single property, `Response`. This property is of type string and can take on one of two values: `True` or `False`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the response's `Response` field will always equal `"True"`. This is represented as:  
`return.Response == "True"`

### Analysis
Given the definition in the Swagger documentation, the `Response` property can take on two distinct values: `True` and `False`. The invariant claims that the `Response` will always be `True`, which contradicts the possibility of it being `False`. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request to this API endpoint, as there are valid scenarios where the response could be `False`.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not account for the possibility of the `Response` being `False`, it is incorrect. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

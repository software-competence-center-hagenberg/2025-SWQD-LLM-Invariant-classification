Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/"
  get:
    summary: Search
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            Response:
              type: string
              example: True
              enum: [True, False]


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: "return.Response == ""True"""

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.OneOfString
Invariant description: Represents String variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

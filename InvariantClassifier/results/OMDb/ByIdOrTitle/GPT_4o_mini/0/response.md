### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at the root path ("/") that returns a response with a 200 status code. The response schema indicates that it returns an object containing a property called "Ratings", which is an array of items. Each item in this array has a property called "Source" that is of type string. The example given for "Source" is "Internet Movie Database".

### Invariant
The invariant states that the value of "return.Source" must be one of the following: { "Internet Movie Database", "Metacritic", "Rotten Tomatoes" }. This means that for any valid response from this endpoint, the "Source" field in the "Ratings" array should only contain one of these three specified values.

### Analysis
The invariant is asserting that the "Source" field can only take on three specific values. However, the Swagger definition does not provide any constraints or enumerations on the possible values for the "Source" field. The only information given is that it is a string and the example provided is "Internet Movie Database". This means that while "Internet Movie Database" is a valid example, there is no indication that it is the only valid value or that the other two values ("Metacritic" and "Rotten Tomatoes") are valid as well. In fact, the absence of constraints means that the "Source" field could potentially contain any string value, not just the three specified in the invariant.

### Conclusion
Since the Swagger definition does not restrict the possible values for "Source" to only the three specified in the invariant, the invariant is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

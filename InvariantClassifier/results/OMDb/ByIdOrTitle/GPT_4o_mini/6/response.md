### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that allows users to search based on a query parameter `y`, which represents the year of release. The response is expected to be a JSON object containing an array `Ratings`, where each item in the array is an object with properties `Source` and `Value`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter `y` must be greater than the size of the `Ratings` array returned in the response. This is expressed as `input.y > size(return.Ratings[])`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the year of release (`y`) should always be greater than the number of ratings returned. This implies that if there are 0 ratings, `y` must be at least 1; if there are 1 rating, `y` must be at least 2, and so on.
2. **Possible Values for `y`**: The year of release can be any integer, including negative values or 0, depending on the API's design. There is no inherent restriction in the Swagger definition that enforces `y` to always be greater than the size of the `Ratings` array.
3. **Edge Cases**: If the `Ratings` array is empty (size 0), the invariant would require `y` to be greater than 0. However, it is entirely possible for `y` to be 0 or even negative, which would violate the invariant. Similarly, if there are multiple ratings, `y` could easily be less than or equal to the size of the `Ratings` array.

### Conclusion
The invariant `input.y > size(return.Ratings[])` does not hold true for all valid requests to the API. There are scenarios where `y` can be less than or equal to the size of the `Ratings` array, making this invariant incorrect. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

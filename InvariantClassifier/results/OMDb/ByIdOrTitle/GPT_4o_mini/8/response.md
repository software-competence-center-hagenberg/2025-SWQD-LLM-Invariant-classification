### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at the root path ("/") that returns a response with a 200 status code. The response is expected to be an object containing a property named `Released`, which is a string. The example given for this property is "12 Jun 2013".

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `Released` field in the response will always be 11 characters. This is represented as `LENGTH(return.Released)==11`.

### Analysis
To evaluate the invariant, we need to consider the example provided in the Swagger definition. The example string "12 Jun 2013" has a length of 11 characters, which matches the invariant. However, the invariant claims that this length will always be 11 for every valid response. 

The `Released` field is defined as a string, but there is no strict enforcement in the Swagger definition that limits the format of this string to always be 11 characters. For instance, if the API were to return a different date format or a different date altogether, such as "1 Jan 2020" (which has a length of 10), or "January 1, 2020" (which has a length of 16), the invariant would not hold. Therefore, while the example provided matches the invariant, it does not guarantee that all possible responses will conform to this length requirement.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant does not hold for all possible valid responses due to the lack of constraints on the format of the `Released` string, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant is not universally true for every valid request on the API.

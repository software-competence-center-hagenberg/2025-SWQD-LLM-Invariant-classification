### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the root path ("/") which returns a response with a property `imdbVotes`. The `imdbVotes` property is defined as a string type, with an example value of "370,080". This indicates that the value is expected to be a string representation of a number, but it may include commas or other non-numeric characters.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.imdbVotes is Numeric`, which is defined as the characters of the string variable being always numeric. This invariant suggests that the `imdbVotes` property should only contain numeric characters without any additional formatting or characters.

### Analysis
The example value "370,080" includes a comma, which is a non-numeric character. This means that while the value represents a numeric quantity, it is not strictly numeric as defined by the invariant. Therefore, the invariant does not hold true for all valid responses from the API, as the response can include formatted numbers with commas or other non-numeric characters.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant requires the `imdbVotes` to be strictly numeric, and the Swagger definition allows for a string that includes non-numeric characters (like commas), the invariant is incorrect. Thus, it is classified as a false-positive.

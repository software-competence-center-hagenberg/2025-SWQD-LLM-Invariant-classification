## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with the path "data.results.images" containing an array of images, each with an "extension" field.

## Invariant
- The invariant is LENGTH(return.extension)==3, which checks if the length of the "extension" field in the response is always 3.

## Analysis
- The invariant assumes that the "extension" field in the response will always have a fixed length of 3 characters.
- However, the length of the "extension" field may vary depending on the actual file extensions of the images returned.
- It is not guaranteed that all image file extensions will have a fixed length of 3 characters.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

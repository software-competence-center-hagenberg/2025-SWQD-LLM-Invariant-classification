The given invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that the 'collectedIssues' and 'dates' arrays will always have the same size, which is not guaranteed by the Swagger definition. The API documentation does not specify any constraints or relationships between the sizes of these arrays, so the invariant cannot be considered true for every valid request on the API.

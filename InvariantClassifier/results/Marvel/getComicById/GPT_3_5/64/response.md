The invariant input.comicId > size(return.variants[]) is a false-positive for the given REST endpoint. The reason for this is that the input.comicId is a path parameter, and it represents a specific comic by its id. The return.variants[] field, on the other hand, is an array of variant issues for the comic, and its size is not directly related to the comicId. The size of return.variants[] does not necessarily have a direct relationship with the input.comicId, and therefore the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

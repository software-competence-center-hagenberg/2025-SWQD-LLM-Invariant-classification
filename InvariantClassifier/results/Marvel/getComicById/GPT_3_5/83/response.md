The given invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant assumes the presence of 'return.pageCount' and 'return.characters.available' fields in the response body, but these fields are not explicitly defined in the provided Swagger excerpt. Without explicit definition, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

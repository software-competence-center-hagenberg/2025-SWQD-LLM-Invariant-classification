## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a field "data.results" which contains an array of comics.
- Each comic in the array has a "resourceURI" field and a "creators" field.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.resourceURI is a substring of return.creators.collectionURI

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the "resourceURI" of a comic is a substring of the "collectionURI" of its creators. This means that the URL identifier for the comic is a part of the path to the full list of creators in the collection.

Given the structure of the response schema, it is not guaranteed that the resourceURI will always be a substring of the collectionURI. The two fields may not have a direct relationship that ensures this invariant holds for every valid request.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive. It does not hold for every valid request on the API.

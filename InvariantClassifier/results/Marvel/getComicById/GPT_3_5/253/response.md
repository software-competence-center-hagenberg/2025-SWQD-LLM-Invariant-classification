The given invariant is a false-positive. The invariant size(return.images[])-1 >= size(return.events.items[])-1 is not correct for every valid request on the API. The Swagger definition provided does not guarantee that the 'images' and 'events.items' arrays will always have the same size or that one will always be greater than the other. Therefore, this invariant cannot be classified as true-positive.

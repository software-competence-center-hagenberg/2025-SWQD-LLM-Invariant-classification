## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a field "data.results.resourceURI" which is described as the canonical URL identifier for the resource.

## Invariant
- The invariant is that "return.resourceURI" is Url, indicating that the value of the field "resourceURI" in the response body is always a URL.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided Swagger definition, the field "resourceURI" in the response body is explicitly described as the canonical URL identifier for the resource.
- This implies that the value of "resourceURI" is expected to be a URL, which aligns with the invariant.
- Therefore, the invariant is a true-positive, as it holds for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the Swagger definition and the invariant, the verdict is true-positive.

The given invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the provided Swagger definition does not guarantee that the 'variants' and 'dates' arrays will always exist in the response. The schema does not specify these fields as required, which means that the response may or may not contain them. As a result, the invariant 'size(return.variants[])-1 != size(return.dates[])' cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

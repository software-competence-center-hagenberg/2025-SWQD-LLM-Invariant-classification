The invariant input.comicId > return.data.limit is false-positive. The reason for this is that the comparison between input.comicId and return.data.limit cannot be guaranteed to hold true for every valid request on the API. The value of comicId in the request and the limit in the response are independent and may not follow a strict ordering relationship. Therefore, this invariant cannot be relied upon to hold true for every valid request.

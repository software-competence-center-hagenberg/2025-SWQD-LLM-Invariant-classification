The invariant states that the size of 'return.textObjects[]' minus 1 should be less than or equal to the size of 'return.stories.items[]' minus 1. This means that the number of text objects in the response should be less than or equal to the number of story items in the response. The invariant type is 'daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntLessEqual', representing an invariant of <= between two long scalars. The fields starting with 'return' refer to the path 'data.results' in the response body.

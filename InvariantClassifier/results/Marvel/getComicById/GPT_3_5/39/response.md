Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' is a GET request to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'creators' field within the 'data.results' path.
Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.creators.items[] elements != null' checks if all 'items' within 'creators' array are not null.
Analysis:
- The response schema does not explicitly enforce that 'creators.items[]' elements cannot be null.
- Therefore, the invariant 'return.creators.items[] elements != null' is a false-positive as it assumes a non-null constraint that is not enforced by the API.
Conclusion:
- Verdict: false-positive

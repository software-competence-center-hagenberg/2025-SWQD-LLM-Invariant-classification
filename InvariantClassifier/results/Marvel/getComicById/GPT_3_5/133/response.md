Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method that fetches a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'data.results.urls' and 'data.results.prices' arrays.

Invariant:
- size(return.urls[]) % size(return.prices[]) == 0

Analysis:
- The invariant checks if the size of the 'urls' array is divisible by the size of the 'prices' array without remainder.
- However, the provided swagger definition does not guarantee that every comic resource will have both 'urls' and 'prices' arrays of the same size.

Conclusion:
- The invariant is false-positive because the API does not enforce a relationship between the sizes of 'urls' and 'prices' arrays in the response for every valid request.

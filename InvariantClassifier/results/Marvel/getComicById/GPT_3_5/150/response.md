The given invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API. The Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the size of the 'collections' and 'characters.items' arrays, and therefore, the invariant cannot be assumed to hold true for all responses. Without explicit constraints on the array sizes, the invariant cannot be considered a true-positive.

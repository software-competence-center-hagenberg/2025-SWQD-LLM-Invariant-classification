The invariant 'return.events.items != null' is false-positive. The reason for this is that the 'events' field is not present in the response schema. The response schema only contains 'data.results', which does not have an 'events' field. Therefore, the invariant 'return.events.items != null' does not hold for every valid request on the API.

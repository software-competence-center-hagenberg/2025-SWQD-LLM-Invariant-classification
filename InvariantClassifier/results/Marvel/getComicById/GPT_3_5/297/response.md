Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' is a GET request to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'data.results' which contains 'stories' and 'textObjects'.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.stories.returned >= size(return.textObjects[])-1' checks if the number of stories returned is greater than or equal to the size of 'textObjects' array minus 1.

Analysis:
- The invariant is false-positive because the response schema does not guarantee that 'stories' and 'textObjects' will always be present in the response. If either of them is missing, the invariant will not hold for the valid requests.

Conclusion:
- Verdict: false-positive

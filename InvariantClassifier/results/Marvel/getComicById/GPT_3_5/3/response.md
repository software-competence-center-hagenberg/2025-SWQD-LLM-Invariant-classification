Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'textObjects' field within 'data.results', which is an array of descriptive text blurbs for the comic.

Invariant:
- The invariant checks if the 'type' field within 'textObjects' is one of the specified values: "70th_winner_desc", "issue_preview_text", or "issue_solicit_text".

Analysis:
- The invariant is true-positive because it ensures that the 'type' field within 'textObjects' is restricted to a specific set of values, which is a valid constraint for the response.

Conclusion:
- Verdict: true-positive

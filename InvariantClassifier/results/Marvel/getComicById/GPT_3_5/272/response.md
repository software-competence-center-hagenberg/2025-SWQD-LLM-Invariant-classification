Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'data.results' which contains 'stories' and 'textObjects' arrays.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.stories.returned >= size(return.textObjects[])' checks if the number of stories returned is greater than or equal to the size of the 'textObjects' array in the response.

Analysis:
- The invariant is false-positive because the response schema does not specify a direct relationship between the 'stories' array and the 'textObjects' array. The invariant assumes a correlation between these two fields that is not explicitly defined in the schema.

Conclusion:
- Verdict: false-positive

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided excerpt of the Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID. The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains 'textObjects' and 'dates' arrays.

### Invariant

The invariant states that the size of the 'textObjects' array in the response should be less than or equal to the size of the 'dates' array.

### Analysis

Based on the provided Swagger definition, the invariant is false-positive. The reason is that the 'textObjects' and 'dates' arrays are not directly comparable in terms of size. The 'textObjects' array is nested within the 'results' array, while the 'dates' array is also nested within the 'results' array. Therefore, the comparison of their sizes at the top level of the response is not meaningful.

### Conclusion

Verdict: false-positive

The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API due to the nested structure of the arrays in the response.

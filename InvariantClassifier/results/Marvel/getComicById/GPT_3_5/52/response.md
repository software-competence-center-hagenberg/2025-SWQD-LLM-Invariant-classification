Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'collections' field within the 'results' array.

Invariant:
- size(return.collections[]) one of { 0, 1, 4}

Analysis:
- The invariant specifies that the size of 'return.collections[]' should be one of {0, 1, 4}.
- However, based on the provided response schema, there is no restriction on the size of 'collections' in the response. It can have any number of elements.

Conclusion:
- The invariant 'size(return.collections[]) one of { 0, 1, 4}' is a false-positive for the given REST API endpoint.

The invariant is false-positive. The Swagger definition provided does not include a clear indication of the relationship between the 'dates' and 'prices' arrays. Without additional information, it cannot be assumed that the size of 'dates' array minus 1 will always be greater than or equal to the size of the 'prices' array. The lack of explicit constraints or dependencies between these arrays in the Swagger definition makes it impossible to guarantee the validity of the invariant for every valid request on the API.

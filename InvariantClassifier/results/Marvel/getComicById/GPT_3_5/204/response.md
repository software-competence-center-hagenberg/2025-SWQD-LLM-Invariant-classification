## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a `data` object with a `results` array, which contains `resourceURI` and `events` properties.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that `return.resourceURI` is a substring of `return.events.collectionURI`.
- This means that the `resourceURI` value should be a substring of the `collectionURI` value within the `events` property of the response.

## Analysis
- The provided swagger definition does not explicitly mention the structure of the `events` property within the `results` array.
- Without knowing the exact structure of `events`, it is not possible to determine if `return.resourceURI` will always be a substring of `return.events.collectionURI` for every valid request.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as: false-positive

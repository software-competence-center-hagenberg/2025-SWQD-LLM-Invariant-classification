## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with "textObjects" and "urls" arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.textObjects[])-1 <= size(return.urls[])
This invariant represents a comparison between the sizes of the "textObjects" and "urls" arrays in the response.

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the size of the "textObjects" array minus 1 is less than or equal to the size of the "urls" array. This means that the number of text objects should be at most one less than the number of URLs.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
Reasoning: Given the structure of the response schema, the invariant holds true for every valid request on the API. The comparison between the sizes of the arrays is well-defined and consistent with the response structure.

The invariant LENGTH(return.copyright)==13 is a false-positive for the given REST endpoint. The Swagger definition does not specify that the length of the 'copyright' field in the response body is fixed at 13 characters. Therefore, this invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

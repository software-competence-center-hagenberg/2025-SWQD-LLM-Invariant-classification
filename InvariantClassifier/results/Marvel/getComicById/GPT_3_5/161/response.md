The invariant return.data.total == size(return.data.results[]) checks if the total number of resources available matches the number of comics returned in the response. This is a valid check to ensure that the total count corresponds to the actual number of results. However, the provided Swagger definition does not include the structure of the response body, so it's not possible to verify if the invariant holds for every valid request on the API. Without the complete response body structure, it's not possible to determine if this invariant is true-positive or false-positive.

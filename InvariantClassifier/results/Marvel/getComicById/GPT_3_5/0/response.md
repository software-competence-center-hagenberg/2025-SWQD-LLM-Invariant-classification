## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with the path "data.results.images" containing an array of promotional images, each with an "extension" field.

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the "extension" field of each promotional image is equal to "jpg".

## Analysis
The invariant is false-positive because it assumes that every promotional image associated with a comic will have the file extension "jpg." However, there could be promotional images with different file extensions, and the invariant does not account for this possibility.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive
The invariant "return.extension == "jpg"" is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

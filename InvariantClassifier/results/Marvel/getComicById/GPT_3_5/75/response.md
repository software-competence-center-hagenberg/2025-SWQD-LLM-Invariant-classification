The invariant 'return.digitalId >= size(return.collections[])' is false-positive. This is because the invariant is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API. The swagger definition does not provide any constraints or guarantees about the relationship between 'digitalId' and the size of 'collections'. Therefore, the invariant cannot be considered true for all valid requests.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with the path "data.results.images" containing an array of promotional images, each with an "extension" field.

## Invariant
- The invariant is "return.extension one of { ""jpg"", ""png"" }", which specifies that the extension of the promotional images should be either "jpg" or "png".

## Analysis
- The response schema does not enforce any restriction on the allowed extensions for the promotional images. Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive because it assumes a constraint that is not specified in the API definition.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant "return.extension one of { ""jpg"", ""png"" }" is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API due to the lack of enforcement in the API definition.

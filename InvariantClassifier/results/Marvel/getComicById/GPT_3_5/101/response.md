Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'data.results' which contains 'creators' and 'variants' arrays.

Invariant:
- return.creators.returned >= size(return.variants[])-1

Analysis:
- The invariant compares the number of 'creators' returned with the size of the 'variants' array.
- However, the invariant is not directly related to the API response or request parameters.

Conclusion:
- The invariant is false-positive as it does not directly relate to the API's behavior or response structure.

The given invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that the 'digitalId' and 'stories.available' fields are directly related, which may not be the case. The 'digitalId' field represents the ID of the digital comic representation, while the 'stories.available' field represents the number of total available stories. These two fields are not necessarily correlated, and their values being unequal does not necessarily indicate an error or inconsistency in the API response. Therefore, the invariant is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

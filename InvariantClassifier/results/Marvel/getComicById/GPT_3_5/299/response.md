The given invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that the 'events' and 'urls' arrays in the response body are related in size, which is not explicitly specified in the Swagger definition. Without a direct relationship between the 'events' and 'urls' arrays, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

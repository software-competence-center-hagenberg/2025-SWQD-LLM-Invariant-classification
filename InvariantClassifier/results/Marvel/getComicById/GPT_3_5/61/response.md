Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' is a GET request to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains information about the comic.
- The 'results' array includes an 'events' object with an 'available' field representing the number of total available events.

Invariant:
- input.comicId > return.events.available

Analysis:
- The invariant compares the input 'comicId' with the 'available' events in the response.
- However, the 'comicId' is just an identifier for the comic and may not have a direct relationship with the number of available events.
- It is unlikely that the 'comicId' would always be greater than the 'available' events, making this invariant a false-positive.

Conclusion:
- Verdict: false-positive

The invariant 'size(return.collectedIssues[]) % size(return.prices[]) == 0' is false-positive.

Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'collectedIssues' and 'prices' as arrays.

Invariant Analysis:
- The invariant checks if the size of 'collectedIssues' array is divisible by the size of 'prices' array without remainder.
- However, there is no guarantee that the number of collected issues will always be divisible by the number of prices for every valid request.

Conclusion:
- Due to the nature of the data and the absence of constraints in the API definition, the invariant is a false-positive and may not hold for every valid request on the API.

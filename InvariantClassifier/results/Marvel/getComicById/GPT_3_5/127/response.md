## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID. The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains 'textObjects' and 'images' arrays.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the 'textObjects' array minus 1 should be less than or equal to the size of the 'images' array.

## Analysis
The invariant is based on the response structure and aims to compare the sizes of two arrays within the 'results' array. However, the provided Swagger definition does not explicitly mention the structure of the 'results' array, and it's unclear if the 'textObjects' and 'images' arrays are directly under 'results' or nested within another object. Without a clear understanding of the response structure, it is not possible to determine if the invariant holds for every valid request.

## Conclusion
Due to the ambiguity in the Swagger definition and the lack of clarity regarding the response structure, the invariant cannot be classified as true-positive or false-positive without further information.

The invariant size(return.textObjects[]) one of { 0, 1, 2 } states that the number of textObjects in the response should be either 0, 1, or 2. This is based on the Swagger definition provided, which describes the structure of the response. The response schema indicates that the 'textObjects' field is an array, and the invariant checks the size of this array. Therefore, the invariant is directly related to the response structure defined in the Swagger definition.

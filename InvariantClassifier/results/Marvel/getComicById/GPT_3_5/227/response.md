The invariant return.creators.returned >= size(return.collectedIssues[]) is a false-positive. This is because the invariant is based on the assumption that the 'creators' and 'collectedIssues' fields will always be present in the response, which may not be the case for every valid request. If a valid request returns a response where 'creators' or 'collectedIssues' are not present, the invariant will not hold. Therefore, it is not a true-positive invariant.

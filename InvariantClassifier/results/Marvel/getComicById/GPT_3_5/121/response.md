Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'textObjects' and 'dates' arrays under 'data.results'.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.dates[])-1' checks if the size of 'textObjects' array is less than or equal to the size of 'dates' array minus 1.

Analysis:
- The invariant is false-positive because it assumes a specific relationship between the sizes of 'textObjects' and 'dates' arrays, which may not hold true for every valid request on the API. The API may return responses where the invariant does not hold.

Conclusion:
- Verdict: false-positive

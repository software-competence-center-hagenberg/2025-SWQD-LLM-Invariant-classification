## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" which fetches a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes the fields 'copyright' and 'attributionText'.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that 'return.copyright' is a substring of 'return.attributionText'.

## Analysis
- The provided swagger definition does not enforce any specific relationship between 'copyright' and 'attributionText'.
- The invariant does not seem to be enforced by the API definition.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains a 'stories' object with a 'returned' field.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.stories.returned >= 2' specifies that the number of stories returned in the collection must be greater than or equal to 2.

Analysis:
- Based on the provided response schema, the 'stories.returned' field represents the number of stories returned in the collection.
- The invariant 'return.stories.returned >= 2' ensures that the API always returns at least 2 stories in the collection.
- However, the response schema does not guarantee that there will always be at least 2 stories returned. It depends on the actual data and the behavior of the API.

Conclusion:
- The invariant 'return.stories.returned >= 2' is a false-positive because it cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method that fetches a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'data.results.stories.available' and 'data.results.textObjects'.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.stories.available >= size(return.textObjects[])' checks if the number of available stories is greater than or equal to the size of the text objects array in the response.

Analysis:
- The invariant is false-positive because the 'stories' and 'textObjects' are not directly related in the response schema. The 'stories' field is an array of objects with a property 'available', while the 'textObjects' field is an array of objects with properties 'type', 'language', and 'text'. There is no direct relationship between the number of available stories and the size of the 'textObjects' array.

Conclusion:
- Verdict: false-positive

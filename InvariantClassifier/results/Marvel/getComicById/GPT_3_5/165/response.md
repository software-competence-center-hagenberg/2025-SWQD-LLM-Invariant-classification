## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'status' field of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking if the 'status' field in the response is equal to "Ok".

## Analysis
- The provided swagger definition does not guarantee that the 'status' field will always be equal to "Ok". The response schema allows the 'status' field to take on any string value, not just "Ok".

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive because it does not hold for every valid request on the API. The response may contain 'status' values other than "Ok".

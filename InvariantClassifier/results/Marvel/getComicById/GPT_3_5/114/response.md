## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" which fetches a single comic by id.
- The response body contains a field "data.results" which includes the fields "events" and "collections".

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.events.available <= size(return.collections[])

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the number of total available events in the list is less than or equal to the size of the collections array.

- The invariant is based on the response body fields "events.available" and "collections[]".
- It ensures that the number of available events is not greater than the size of the collections array.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a true-positive. It holds true for every valid request on the API as it ensures a logical relationship between the number of available events and the size of the collections array in the response.

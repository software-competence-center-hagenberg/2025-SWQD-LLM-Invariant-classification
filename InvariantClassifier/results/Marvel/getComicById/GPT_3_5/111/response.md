Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The API endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'data.results' which contains 'events' and 'textObjects' arrays.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.events.available <= size(return.textObjects[])' checks if the number of total available events is less than or equal to the size of the 'textObjects' array in the response.

Analysis:
- The invariant is false-positive because the 'events' and 'textObjects' arrays are not directly related. The number of available events does not necessarily have a direct relationship with the size of the 'textObjects' array.

Conclusion:
- Verdict: false-positive

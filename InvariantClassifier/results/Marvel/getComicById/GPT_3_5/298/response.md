## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a "data" object with a "results" array containing comic information, including "stories" and "prices".

## Invariant
- The invariant is: return.stories.returned >= size(return.prices[])-1
- This means that the number of stories returned should be greater than or equal to the size of the prices array minus 1.

## Analysis
- The response schema does not explicitly guarantee that the number of stories returned will be related to the size of the prices array.
- The invariant assumes a specific relationship between the number of stories and the size of the prices array, which is not explicitly defined in the response schema.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive because it assumes a relationship between the number of stories and the size of the prices array that is not guaranteed by the API's response schema.

The invariant return.stories.available != size(return.variants[])-1 is false-positive. The Swagger definition does not provide any guarantee that the number of available stories in a comic will always be different from the size of the variants array minus 1. The API documentation does not specify any relationship between these two fields, and there are no constraints or business rules mentioned that enforce this relationship. Therefore, this invariant cannot be considered true-positive.

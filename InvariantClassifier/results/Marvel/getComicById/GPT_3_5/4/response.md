## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with the path "data.results.textObjects.language" representing the language of the text object.

## Invariant
- The invariant "return.language == "en-us"" checks if the language of the text object is "en-us" in the response.

## Analysis
- The provided response schema does not guarantee that the language of the text object will always be "en-us". The schema allows for multiple text objects with different languages, and there is no constraint ensuring that "en-us" will always be present.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant "return.language == "en-us"" is a false-positive. It will not hold for every valid request on the API.

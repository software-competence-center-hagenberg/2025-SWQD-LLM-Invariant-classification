**Swagger Definition Breakdown**

The given swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by id. The response schema includes a `data` object with a `results` array, which contains information about the comic, including the `resourceURI` and `characters` properties.

**Invariant**

The invariant states that `return.resourceURI` is a substring of `return.characters.collectionURI`.

**Analysis**

Based on the provided swagger definition, the `return.resourceURI` and `return.characters.collectionURI` are both properties of the `results` array in the response body. However, the schema does not specify that `return.resourceURI` is a substring of `return.characters.collectionURI`. Without further context or constraints, this invariant cannot be assumed to hold true for every valid request on the API.

**Conclusion**

The invariant is a false-positive as it cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API based on the provided swagger definition.

Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains 'images' array within each item.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.images[] elements != null' checks if all 'images' arrays within the 'results' array are not null.

Analysis:
- The response schema does not explicitly define 'images' as a required field, so it is possible for 'images' arrays to be null or missing.

Conclusion:
- The invariant 'return.images[] elements != null' is a false-positive because it assumes that 'images' arrays will always be present and not null, which is not guaranteed by the API response schema.

The invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that both 'collectedIssues' and 'prices' arrays will always have at least one element. However, the description in the swagger definition mentions that 'collectedIssues' will generally be empty for periodical formats such as 'comic' or 'magazine'. Therefore, the assumption that both arrays will always have at least one element is incorrect, leading to a false-positive classification.

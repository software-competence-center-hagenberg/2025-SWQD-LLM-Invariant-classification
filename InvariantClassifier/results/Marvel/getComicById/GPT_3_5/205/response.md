The invariant return.creators.items[] is a superset of return.events.items[] is false-positive. The Swagger definition provided does not specify any relationship between creators and events. There is no indication that the list of creators is related to the list of events in a way that would make one a superset of the other. Without additional information or constraints in the API documentation, this invariant cannot be assumed to hold for every valid request on the API.

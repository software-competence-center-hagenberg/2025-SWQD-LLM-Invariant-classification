The invariant input.comicId > size(return.collectedIssues[]) is a false-positive. This is because the size of the collectedIssues array in the response may not always be directly related to the comicId provided in the request. The number of collected issues for a comic is not necessarily determined by the comicId, and there could be scenarios where the invariant does not hold true. Therefore, this invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

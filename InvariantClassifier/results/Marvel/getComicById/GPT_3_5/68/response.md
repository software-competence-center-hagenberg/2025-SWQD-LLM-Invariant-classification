## Swagger Definition Breakdown

- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a property 'data.results.images' which is an array of promotional images associated with the comic.

## Invariant

The invariant states that 'input.comicId' should be greater than the size of 'return.images[]'.

## Analysis

- The 'input.comicId' is the ID of the comic provided in the request path.
- The 'return.images[]' refers to the array of promotional images associated with the comic in the response.
- The invariant is false-positive because the size of 'return.images[]' does not depend on the 'input.comicId'. The number of images associated with a comic is not related to the ID of the comic.

## Conclusion

The invariant is false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

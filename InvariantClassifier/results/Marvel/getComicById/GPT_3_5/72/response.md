The invariant return.digitalId >= size(return.textObjects[])-1 is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is comparing the digitalId field with the size of the textObjects array in the response. However, the digitalId field is not directly related to the size of the textObjects array, and there is no inherent relationship between these two fields. Therefore, this invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID. The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains 'textObjects' and 'urls' arrays.

### Invariant

The invariant states that the size of the 'textObjects' array in the response should be less than or equal to the size of the 'urls' array.

### Analysis

Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'textObjects' and 'urls' arrays are both part of the 'results' array in the response. Therefore, the invariant is comparing the sizes of these two arrays within the 'results' array.

### Conclusion

The invariant is a false-positive. It does not hold for every valid request on the API because the sizes of 'textObjects' and 'urls' arrays are independent of each other and may not have a direct relationship of <= between them. Therefore, the invariant is not a true representation of the API's behavior.

The invariant return.stories.returned != size(return.collectedIssues[])-1 is a false-positive.

Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The API endpoint fetches a single comic by id and returns a response with a 'data' object containing 'results' which includes 'stories' and 'collectedIssues'.

Invariant Analysis:
- The invariant return.stories.returned != size(return.collectedIssues[])-1 compares the number of stories returned with the size of collected issues array minus 1. However, the swagger definition does not guarantee that the 'stories' and 'collectedIssues' arrays will always be present or have a specific relationship in size.

Conclusion:
- Due to the lack of guarantee in the swagger definition, the invariant return.stories.returned != size(return.collectedIssues[])-1 is a false-positive and may not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" which fetches a single comic by id.
- The response body contains a field "data.results" which includes information about the comic, including the number of available stories and events.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.stories.available > return.events.available

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the number of available stories is greater than the number of available events for a comic.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive. This is because the invariant assumes a specific relationship between the number of available stories and events for a comic, which may not hold true for all comics. There could be valid cases where the number of available stories is not greater than the number of available events, making the invariant incorrect for every valid request on the API.

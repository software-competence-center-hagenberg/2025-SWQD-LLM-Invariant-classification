The invariant return.pageCount != size(return.stories.items[])-1 is false-positive. This is because the given Swagger definition does not provide any guarantee about the relationship between pageCount and the number of items in the stories array. The API documentation does not specify any constraints or rules regarding the relationship between these two fields, so the invariant cannot be assumed to hold for every valid request on the API.

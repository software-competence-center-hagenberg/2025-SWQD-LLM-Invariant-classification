## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a property "data" which contains a property "results" that is an array of comics.
- Each comic in the array has a property "series".

## Invariant
- The invariant is "return.series != null", which means that the series property of each comic in the response array should not be null.

## Analysis
- The response schema does not explicitly define the series property to be non-null, so there is no guarantee that every comic in the response array will have a non-null series property.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant "return.series != null" is a false-positive because it does not hold for every valid request on the API. There is no guarantee that the series property of every comic in the response array will not be null.

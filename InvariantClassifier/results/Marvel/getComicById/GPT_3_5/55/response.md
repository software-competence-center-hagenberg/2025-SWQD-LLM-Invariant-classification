## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a field 'digitalId' under 'data.results' which represents the ID of the digital comic representation.

## Invariant
The invariant states that input.comicId should not be equal to return.digitalId.

## Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive.
- The reason is that the 'digitalId' in the response represents the ID of the digital comic representation, which may or may not be the same as the 'comicId' provided in the request.
- It is possible for 'comicId' and 'digitalId' to be different, especially if the digital representation has a separate ID system.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

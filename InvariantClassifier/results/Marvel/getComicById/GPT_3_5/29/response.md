### Swagger Definition Breakdown

- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains a 'dates' array.

### Invariant

- The invariant 'return.dates[] elements != null' checks if all elements in the 'dates' array are not null.

### Analysis

- The invariant 'return.dates[] elements != null' is a valid check to ensure that all elements in the 'dates' array are not null.
- However, the provided Swagger definition does not guarantee that the 'dates' array will always contain non-null elements. The schema does not specify any constraints on the 'dates' array elements.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.dates[] elements != null' is a false-positive. It cannot be guaranteed that all elements in the 'dates' array will be non-null for every valid request on the API.

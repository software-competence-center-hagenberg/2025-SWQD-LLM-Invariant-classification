The invariant input.comicId > size(return.urls[]) is false-positive. The reason for this is that the input.comicId is a path parameter, and it represents a specific comic ID. The return.urls[] refers to the URLs of the comics returned by the call, which is an array of URLs. There is no direct relationship between the input comicId and the size of the return.urls[]. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

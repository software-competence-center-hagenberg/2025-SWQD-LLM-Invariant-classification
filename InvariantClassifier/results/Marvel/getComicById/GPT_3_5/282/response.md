### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID. The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains 'collectedIssues' and 'dates' arrays.

### Invariant

The invariant states that the size of the 'collectedIssues' array in the response should be divisible without remainder by the size of the 'dates' array minus 1.

### Analysis

The invariant is false-positive. The invariant assumes a specific relationship between the sizes of the 'collectedIssues' and 'dates' arrays, which may not hold true for every valid request. There is no guarantee that the size of 'collectedIssues' will always be divisible without remainder by the size of 'dates' minus 1. The relationship between these arrays is not explicitly defined in the Swagger definition or the API documentation.

### Conclusion

Verdict: false-positive

The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API as it assumes a specific relationship between the sizes of the 'collectedIssues' and 'dates' arrays, which is not guaranteed by the API.

The invariant size(return.textObjects[])-1 <= size(return.urls[])-1 is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that both 'textObjects' and 'urls' arrays will always have at least one element, which is not guaranteed by the Swagger definition. The 'textObjects' and 'urls' arrays are defined as arrays of objects, but there is no specification that mandates a minimum size for these arrays. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

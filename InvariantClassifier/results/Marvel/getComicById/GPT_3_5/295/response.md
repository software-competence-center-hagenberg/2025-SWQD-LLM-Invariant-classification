## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'data.results.stories.available' and 'data.results.textObjects'.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.stories.available >= size(return.textObjects[])-1' specifies that the number of available stories should be greater than or equal to the size of textObjects array minus 1.

## Analysis
- The response schema does not explicitly define the 'size' of the 'textObjects' array.
- The invariant assumes that 'textObjects' is an array, but it is not explicitly defined as an array in the schema.
- Without the explicit definition of the array size, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it makes assumptions about the structure of the response that are not explicitly defined in the swagger definition.

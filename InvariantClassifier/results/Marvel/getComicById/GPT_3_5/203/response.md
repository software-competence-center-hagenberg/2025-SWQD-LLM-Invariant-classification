### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains 'resourceURI' and 'stories' properties.

### Invariant
- The invariant states that 'return.resourceURI' should be a substring of 'return.stories.collectionURI'.

### Analysis
- The provided Swagger definition does not explicitly mention that 'return.resourceURI' should be a substring of 'return.stories.collectionURI'.
- The response schema does not enforce this relationship, and there is no indication in the description or schema that 'resourceURI' is a substring of 'collectionURI'.

### Conclusion
- The invariant 'return.resourceURI is a substring of return.stories.collectionURI' is a false-positive as it is not guaranteed by the API definition.

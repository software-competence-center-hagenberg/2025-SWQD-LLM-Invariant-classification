The invariant return.characters.available > size(return.collectedIssues[]) is a false-positive. This is because the provided Swagger definition does not guarantee that the 'characters.available' field and the 'collectedIssues' array are directly related in a way that would always satisfy the invariant. The 'characters.available' field represents the number of total available characters, while the 'collectedIssues' array represents a list of issues collected in the comic. There is no explicit relationship between the number of available characters and the size of the collected issues, and therefore, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

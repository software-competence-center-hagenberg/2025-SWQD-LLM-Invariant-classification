## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with the path "data.results.events.items.resourceURI".

## Invariant
- LENGTH(return.resourceURI)==46
- This invariant specifies that the length of the "resourceURI" in the response body is always 46 characters.

## Analysis
- The provided Swagger definition does not explicitly enforce a fixed length of 46 characters for the "resourceURI" field.
- The length of the "resourceURI" in the response may vary based on the actual data and is not constrained to be 46 characters.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the Swagger definition and the invariant, the invariant "LENGTH(return.resourceURI)==46" is a false-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' is a GET request to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes 'data.results' which contains 'stories' and 'collectedIssues'.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.stories.available != size(return.collectedIssues[])' states that the number of available stories should not be equal to the size of collected issues.

## Analysis
- The response schema does not explicitly provide a field named 'return.stories.available' or 'return.collectedIssues[]'.
- It is assumed that 'return.stories.available' and 'return.collectedIssues[]' are placeholders for the actual response fields.
- Without knowing the actual response field names, it is not possible to evaluate the correctness of the invariant.

## Conclusion
- Due to the lack of specific field names in the response schema, the invariant cannot be evaluated as true-positive or false-positive.

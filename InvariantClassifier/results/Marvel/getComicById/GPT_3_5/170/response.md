## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a property "data" which contains a property "limit" of type integer.

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking if the value of "return.data.limit" is equal to 20.

## Analysis
- The swagger definition does not specify that the value of "limit" will always be 20. It only describes the type and description of the property.
- Without further constraints or documentation, it cannot be assumed that the value of "limit" will always be 20 for every valid request.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant "return.data.limit == 20" is a false-positive as it cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

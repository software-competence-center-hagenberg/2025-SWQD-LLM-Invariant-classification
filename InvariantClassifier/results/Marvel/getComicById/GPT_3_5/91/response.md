The invariant return.pageCount % size(return.prices[]) == 0 is false-positive. This is because the 'return' fields refer to the 'data.results' path in the response body, and the 'prices' field is nested within 'results', which is an array. Therefore, 'return.prices[]' does not represent a single value, but rather an array of prices for the comics. As a result, the size of 'return.prices[]' will not be a single value, and the modulo operation with 'return.pageCount' will not hold true for every valid request on the API.

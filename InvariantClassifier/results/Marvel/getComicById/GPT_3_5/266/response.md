The invariant return.pageCount != size(return.collectedIssues[])-1 is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant assumes a specific relationship between the pageCount and the size of collectedIssues, which may not hold true for all valid requests. The size of collectedIssues may not always be directly related to the pageCount, and there could be valid scenarios where this relationship does not hold. Therefore, this invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

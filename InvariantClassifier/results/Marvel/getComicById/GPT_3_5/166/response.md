## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'copyright' field of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the 'copyright' field in the response is equal to "\\"\251 2022 MARVEL"".

## Analysis
The invariant is checking for an exact string match in the response 'copyright' field. However, the swagger definition does not specify that the 'copyright' field will always have the value "\\"\251 2022 MARVEL"". It is possible that the 'copyright' field may have different values for different comics.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it assumes a specific value for the 'copyright' field in the response, which is not guaranteed by the API definition.

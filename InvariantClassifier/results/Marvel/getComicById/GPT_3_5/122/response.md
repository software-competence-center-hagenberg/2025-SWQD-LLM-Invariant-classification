## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint fetches a single comic by id and returns a response with a structure containing 'textObjects' and 'prices'.
- The 'textObjects' field is an array of descriptive text blurbs for the comic, and the 'prices' field is an array of prices for the comic.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the size of 'textObjects' array should be less than or equal to the size of the 'prices' array in the response.

## Analysis
- The provided swagger definition does not explicitly specify a relationship between the sizes of 'textObjects' and 'prices'.
- The invariant assumes a relationship between these arrays that is not enforced by the API definition.
- It is possible for the API to return a response where the size of 'textObjects' is greater than the size of 'prices', making the invariant false-positive.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

The invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant compares 'return.digitalId' with 'return.events.available', but these fields are not directly related to each other in the response schema. The 'digitalId' is a property of each item in the 'results' array, while 'events.available' is a property of the 'events' object within each item in the 'results' array. Therefore, there is no direct relationship between these two fields in the response schema, and the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

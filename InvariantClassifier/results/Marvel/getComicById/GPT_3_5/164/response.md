## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'code' field of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.code == 200', which means that the response code should be 200 for every valid request.

## Analysis
Based on the provided swagger definition, the response schema includes a 'code' field, but it does not specify that the 'code' field should always be 200. Therefore, the invariant 'return.code == 200' is a false-positive.

## Conclusion
The invariant 'return.code == 200' is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

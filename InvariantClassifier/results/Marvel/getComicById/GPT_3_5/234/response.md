The invariant return.characters.returned >= size(return.prices[])-1 is false-positive. This is because the given Swagger definition does not provide any information about the relationship between the number of characters and the number of prices for a comic. The response schema does not enforce any specific relationship between these two fields, and therefore, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

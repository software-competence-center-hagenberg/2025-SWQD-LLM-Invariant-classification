- The API endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'attributionText' and 'attributionHTML' properties.

### Invariant
- The invariant 'return.attributionText is a substring of return.attributionHTML' checks if the 'attributionText' is a substring of 'attributionHTML' in the response.

### Analysis
- The invariant is true-positive because it ensures that the 'attributionText' is always a substring of 'attributionHTML' in the response. This is a valid requirement for the API response.

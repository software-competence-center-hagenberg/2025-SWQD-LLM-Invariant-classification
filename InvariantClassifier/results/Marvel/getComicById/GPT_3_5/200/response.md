## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a property "data.results" which contains an array of comics with properties like "title" and "variantDescription".

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.variantDescription is a substring of return.title

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the "variantDescription" of a comic is a substring of its "title" in the response. However, based on the provided Swagger definition, there is no indication that the variant description should be a substring of the title. It is possible for a variant description to be completely different from the title, and there is no constraint in the API definition that enforces this invariant.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

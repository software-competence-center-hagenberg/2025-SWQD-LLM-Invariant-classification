## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET request to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a field 'attributionHTML' of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant specifies that the length of the 'attributionHTML' field in the response should always be 70.

## Analysis
- The swagger definition does not provide any constraint on the length of the 'attributionHTML' field.
- There is no indication in the API documentation or response schema that the 'attributionHTML' field should always have a fixed length of 70.

## Conclusion
The invariant LENGTH(return.attributionHTML)==70 is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method that fetches a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'data.results' which contains 'characters' and 'textObjects' arrays.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.characters.available >= size(return.textObjects[])-1' checks if the number of available characters is greater than or equal to the size of the 'textObjects' array minus 1.

Analysis:
- The invariant is false-positive because the size of 'textObjects[]' minus 1 may not always be a meaningful comparison to 'characters.available'. The relationship between these two fields is not explicitly defined in the Swagger definition, and it's unclear how they are related.

Conclusion:
- Verdict: false-positive

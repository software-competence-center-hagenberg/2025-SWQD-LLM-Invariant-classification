Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' is a GET request to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'creators' and 'textObjects' as properties.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.creators.available >= size(return.textObjects[])-1' checks if the number of available creators is greater than or equal to the size of 'textObjects' array minus 1.

Analysis:
- The invariant is false-positive because the 'creators.available' field is not directly related to the 'textObjects' array. There is no explicit relationship between the number of available creators and the size of the 'textObjects' array in the response schema.

Conclusion:
- Verdict: false-positive

The invariant return.digitalId != return.characters.available is a false-positive. This is because the invariant is based on the assumption that both return.digitalId and return.characters.available will always be present in the response, which is not guaranteed by the Swagger definition. The response schema does not enforce the presence of these fields, so the invariant may not hold for all valid requests on the API.

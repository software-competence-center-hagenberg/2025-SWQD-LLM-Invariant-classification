Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' is a GET method that fetches a single comic by id.
- The response body contains 'textObjects' and 'collectedIssues' arrays.

Invariant:
- size(return.textObjects[]) >= size(return.collectedIssues[])

Analysis:
- The invariant checks if the size of 'textObjects' array is greater than or equal to the size of 'collectedIssues' array in the response.
- However, the provided Swagger definition does not guarantee that 'textObjects' and 'collectedIssues' arrays will always be present in the response.
- It is possible that either of the arrays is empty or not present in certain valid responses, making the invariant false-positive.

Conclusion:
- The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

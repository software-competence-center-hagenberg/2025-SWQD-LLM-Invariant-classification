Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' is a GET request to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains a 'stories' object with a 'returned' field.

Invariant:
- input.comicId > return.stories.returned

Analysis:
- The invariant compares the 'comicId' from the request with the 'returned' field from the response.
- However, the 'comicId' is an identifier for the comic, and it does not directly relate to the number of stories returned.
- There is no inherent relationship between the 'comicId' and the 'returned' field, so the invariant is a false-positive.

Conclusion:
- Verdict: false-positive

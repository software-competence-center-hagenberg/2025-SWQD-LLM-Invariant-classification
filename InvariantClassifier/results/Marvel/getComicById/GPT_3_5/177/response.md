The invariant return.data.results[] elements == return.data.results[return.data.offset] is false-positive. This is because the invariant assumes that the elements in the results array are related to the offset, which may not be the case. The offset is simply the requested offset (number of skipped results) of the call and may not directly correspond to the elements in the results array. Therefore, this invariant will not hold for every valid request on the API.

Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'data.results.urls' and 'data.results.collections' as arrays.

Invariant:
- size(return.urls[]) >= size(return.collections[])

Analysis:
Based on the provided Swagger definition, the invariant 'size(return.urls[]) >= size(return.collections[])' is a false-positive. This is because the response schema does not guarantee that the 'urls' array will always be larger than or equal to the 'collections' array. The sizes of these arrays are not constrained by the API definition, and therefore the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

Conclusion:
The invariant 'size(return.urls[]) >= size(return.collections[])' is a false-positive for the given REST API endpoint.

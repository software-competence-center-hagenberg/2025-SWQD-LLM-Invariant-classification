The invariant `return.pageCount >= size(return.variants[])` states that the `pageCount` of the comic should be greater than or equal to the number of variants of the comic. Based on the provided Swagger definition, the `pageCount` is a property of each item in the `results` array, while `variants` is also a property of each item in the `results` array. Therefore, for each comic, the `pageCount` should be greater than or equal to the number of variants. This is a true-positive invariant because it holds for every valid request on the API.

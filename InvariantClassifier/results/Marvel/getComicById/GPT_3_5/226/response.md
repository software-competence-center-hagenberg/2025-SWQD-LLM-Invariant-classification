The given invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that the 'creators' and 'collectedIssues' fields are present in every response, which may not be the case. The Swagger definition does not specify these fields as required, and they are not guaranteed to be present in every response. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

The invariant LENGTH(return.diamondCode)==9 is false-positive. This is because the swagger definition does not guarantee that the 'diamondCode' field in the response will always have a fixed length of 9 characters. The description and schema of the 'diamondCode' field do not specify a fixed length requirement. Therefore, this invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

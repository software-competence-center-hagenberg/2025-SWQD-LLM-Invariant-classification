## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is defined as a GET request to "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}".
- The response schema includes a nested structure with the following path: "data.results.series.resourceURI".

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the field "series.resourceURI" in the response body is always a URL.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition, there is no explicit indication that the field "series.resourceURI" is guaranteed to be a URL. The schema does not enforce the format of the "resourceURI" field, and it is described as a string without any specific format constraints.

## Conclusion
The invariant "return.series.resourceURI is Url" is a false-positive. It cannot be guaranteed that the field "series.resourceURI" in the response body is always a URL based on the provided Swagger definition.

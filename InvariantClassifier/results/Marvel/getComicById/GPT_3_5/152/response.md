The given invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is comparing the sizes of two arrays in the response body, specifically 'collectedIssues' and 'images'. However, there is no guarantee that both arrays will always be present in the response, and therefore the comparison may not hold for every valid request on the API. Additionally, the invariant does not consider the possibility of empty arrays, which could lead to unexpected results.

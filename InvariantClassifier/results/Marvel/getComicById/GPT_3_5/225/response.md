## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes 'pageCount' and 'collectedIssues' fields within the 'results' array.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.pageCount >= size(return.collectedIssues[])' checks if the number of story pages in the comic is greater than or equal to the size of collected issues.

## Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive because the 'pageCount' and 'collectedIssues' are not directly related in a way that guarantees 'pageCount' to be greater than or equal to the size of 'collectedIssues'.
- The 'pageCount' and 'collectedIssues' are independent fields, and their relationship is not constrained by the API definition.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API as the relationship between 'pageCount' and 'collectedIssues' is not guaranteed by the API definition.

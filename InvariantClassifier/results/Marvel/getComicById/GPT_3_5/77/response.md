The given invariant checks if the value of 'digitalId' in the response is not equal to the size of 'dates' array minus 1. This invariant is false-positive because it assumes a specific relationship between 'digitalId' and the size of 'dates' array, which may not hold true for every valid request on the API. The relationship between 'digitalId' and 'dates' array size is not explicitly defined in the Swagger definition, and it's possible that the API allows valid responses where the invariant does not hold.

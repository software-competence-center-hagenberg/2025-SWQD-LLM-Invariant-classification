### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains information about the comic.

### Invariant
- The invariant 'return.data.results != null' checks if the 'results' array in the response data is not null.

### Analysis
- Based on the provided swagger definition, the 'results' array is expected to contain information about the comic, and it should not be null.
- Therefore, the invariant 'return.data.results != null' is true-positive, as it correctly ensures that the 'results' array is not null for a valid response.

### Conclusion
- Verdict: true-positive
- The invariant holds for every valid request on the API, as the 'results' array is expected to contain information about the comic and should not be null.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes 'collectedIssues' and 'dates' as arrays under 'data.results'.

### Invariant
- The invariant states that the size of 'collectedIssues' array should not be equal to the size of 'dates' array in the response.

### Analysis
- The provided response schema does not guarantee that 'collectedIssues' and 'dates' arrays will always have different sizes. It is possible for them to have the same size in certain valid responses.

### Conclusion
The invariant 'size(return.collectedIssues[]) != size(return.dates[])' is a false-positive because it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

The invariant input.comicId > size(return.collections[]) is false-positive. The reason for this is that the size of return.collections[] is not directly related to the input.comicId. The size of return.collections[] depends on the specific comicId being requested and the data available in the API. It is not a general rule that input.comicId will always be greater than the size of return.collections[]. Therefore, this invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

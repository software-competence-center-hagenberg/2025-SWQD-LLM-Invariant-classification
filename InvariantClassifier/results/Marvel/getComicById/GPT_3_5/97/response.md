Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' is a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which includes 'creators' and 'collections' fields.
Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.creators.available >= size(return.collections[])-1' checks if the number of available creators is greater than or equal to the size of collections minus 1.
Analysis:
- The invariant is false-positive because it assumes a specific relationship between the number of available creators and the size of collections, which may not hold true for every valid request on the API. There is no guarantee that the number of available creators will have a specific relationship with the size of collections.
Conclusion:
- Verdict: false-positive

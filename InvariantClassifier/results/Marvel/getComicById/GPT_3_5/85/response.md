Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'data.results' which contains 'pageCount' and 'events.available' fields.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.pageCount >= return.events.available' checks if the number of story pages in the comic is greater than or equal to the number of total available events.

Analysis:
- Based on the provided response schema, the invariant 'return.pageCount >= return.events.available' is a false-positive. This is because the 'pageCount' and 'events.available' fields are not at the same level in the response schema. The 'pageCount' is a property of 'items' in the 'results' array, while 'events.available' is a property of 'events' in the 'results' array. Therefore, comparing these two fields directly as part of the same object is not valid.

Conclusion:
- Verdict: false-positive

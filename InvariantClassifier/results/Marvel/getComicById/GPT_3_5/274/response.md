The given invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that the 'stories.returned' field and the 'collectedIssues' array will always be present in the response. However, the swagger definition does not guarantee that these fields will always be present. Therefore, the invariant will not hold for every valid request on the API.

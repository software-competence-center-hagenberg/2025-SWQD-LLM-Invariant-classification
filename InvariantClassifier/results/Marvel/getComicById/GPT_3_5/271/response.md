The invariant return.stories.available > size(return.collectedIssues[]) is a false-positive. This is because the 'return' fields refer to the path 'data.results' in the response body, and the 'stories' and 'collectedIssues' are nested within 'results'. Therefore, the comparison between 'stories.available' and the size of 'collectedIssues[]' is not valid at the top level of 'data.results'. To compare these values, it would be necessary to access a specific 'comic' resource within 'data.results' and then compare the 'stories.available' and the size of 'collectedIssues[]' for that specific comic. As a result, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes 'textObjects' and 'collectedIssues' arrays.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'size(return.textObjects[])-1 >= size(return.collectedIssues[])-1' checks if the size of 'textObjects' array minus 1 is greater than or equal to the size of 'collectedIssues' array minus 1.

Analysis:
- The invariant is comparing the sizes of 'textObjects' and 'collectedIssues' arrays in the response.
- However, the invariant does not consider any specific conditions or constraints related to the API or the data in the arrays.
- Without additional context or constraints, the invariant is a false-positive because it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

Conclusion:
- Verdict: false-positive

Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains 'collectedIssues' with a 'resourceURI' field.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.resourceURI is Url' checks if the 'resourceURI' field in 'collectedIssues' is always a URL.

Analysis:
- Based on the provided swagger definition, there is no explicit validation or constraint on the 'resourceURI' field to ensure that it is always a URL.
- The swagger definition does not enforce the format or type of the 'resourceURI' field.

Conclusion:
- The invariant 'return.resourceURI is Url' is a false-positive because the swagger definition does not guarantee that the 'resourceURI' field in 'collectedIssues' is always a URL. It is possible for the field to contain non-URL values.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID. The response schema includes a 'data' object, which contains a 'results' array. Within the 'results' array, there is a 'prices' array, and each 'price' within the 'prices' array is a number representing the price of the comic.

## Invariant

The invariant 'return.price >= 0.0' specifies that the price of the comic returned in the response must be greater than or equal to 0.0.

## Analysis

Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'price' field is defined as a number within the 'prices' array. This means that the 'price' should always be a valid number, and the invariant 'return.price >= 0.0' should hold true for every valid response.

## Conclusion

The invariant 'return.price >= 0.0' is classified as a true-positive, as it should hold for every valid response on the API.

The invariant 'return.textObjects[] elements != null' is a false-positive for the given REST endpoint. The Swagger definition does not specify that the 'textObjects' array cannot be null. Therefore, it is possible for the 'textObjects' array to be null in the response, which would violate the invariant. The absence of a specific constraint in the Swagger definition means that the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a field 'attributionHTML' of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant checks if the 'attributionHTML' field in the response is equal to a specific HTML string.

## Analysis
- The invariant is checking for a specific value of the 'attributionHTML' field in the response.
- It assumes that the 'attributionHTML' field will always have the exact specified value.
- However, the API response may contain different values for 'attributionHTML' depending on the specific comic being fetched.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive because the 'attributionHTML' field may not always be equal to the specified HTML string for every valid request on the API.

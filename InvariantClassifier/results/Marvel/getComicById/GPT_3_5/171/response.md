## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'total' property of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.data.total == 1

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the 'total' property in the response data is equal to 1.

Given the information from the swagger definition, the invariant is a false-positive. The 'total' property is described as the total number of resources available given the current filter set, and it is not guaranteed to be equal to 1 for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant will not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive

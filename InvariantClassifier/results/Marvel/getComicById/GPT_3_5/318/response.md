## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID.
- The endpoint takes a path parameter `comicId` of type integer.
- The response schema includes a property `data` which contains a property `limit` of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the `comicId` in the request should not be equal to the `limit` in the response.

## Analysis
- The invariant is based on the comparison of the `comicId` in the request and the `limit` in the response.
- However, the `limit` in the response is not directly related to the `comicId` in the request. It seems that the comparison is not meaningful in the context of the API endpoint.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive. It does not hold for every valid request on the API because the comparison between `comicId` and `limit` is not relevant in this context.

The given invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the provided Swagger definition does not specify the structure of the response body in enough detail to support the invariant. The invariant relies on the structure and content of 'return.urls[]' and 'return.collectedIssues[]', but the Swagger definition does not provide enough information about these fields. Without a detailed specification of the response body, it is not possible to determine if the invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

The invariant return.digitalId != return.stories.returned is a false-positive. This is because the provided Swagger definition does not specify that the 'digitalId' and 'stories.returned' fields are related in any way. The 'digitalId' represents the ID of the digital comic representation, while 'stories.returned' represents the number of stories returned in the collection. There is no indication in the Swagger definition that these two fields should be related or that their values should be unequal. Therefore, this invariant cannot be assumed to hold for every valid request on the API.

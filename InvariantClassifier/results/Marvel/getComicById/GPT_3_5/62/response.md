Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' is a GET request that fetches a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'textObjects' array within the 'results' array.
Invariant:
- input.comicId > size(return.textObjects[])
Analysis:
- The invariant checks if the 'comicId' in the request is greater than the number of 'textObjects' in the response.
- However, the 'textObjects' array is nested within the 'results' array, and there is no direct way to compare 'comicId' with the size of 'textObjects'.
- The invariant does not account for the nested structure of the response and cannot be directly evaluated based on the provided Swagger definition.
Conclusion:
- The invariant is a false-positive as it does not accurately capture the relationship between 'comicId' and the size of 'textObjects' in the response.

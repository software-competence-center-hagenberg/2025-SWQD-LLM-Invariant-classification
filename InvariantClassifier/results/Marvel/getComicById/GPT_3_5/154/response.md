## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" has a GET method to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a "data" object with a "results" array containing information about the comic, including "dates" and "prices" arrays.

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking if the size of the "dates" array is divisible by the size of the "prices" array without remainder.

## Analysis
- The invariant is checking a relationship between the sizes of two arrays in the response.
- However, the provided Swagger definition does not guarantee that the "dates" and "prices" arrays will always be present or have the same length for every valid request.
- The absence of these arrays or their mismatched lengths could lead to the invariant being false for certain valid requests.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

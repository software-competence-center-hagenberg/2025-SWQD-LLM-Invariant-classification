## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a field "data.results.collections.resourceURI" which represents the path to the individual comic resource.

## Invariant
The invariant states that "return.resourceURI is Url", indicating that the value of the field "resourceURI" in the response body is always a URL.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition, the response schema does not enforce the format of the "resourceURI" field as a URL. Therefore, the invariant "return.resourceURI is Url" is a false-positive.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

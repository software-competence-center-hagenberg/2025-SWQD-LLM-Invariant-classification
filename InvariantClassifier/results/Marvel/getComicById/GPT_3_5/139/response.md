The invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the provided Swagger definition does not guarantee the presence of 'variants' and 'dates' fields in the response. The 'variants' and 'dates' fields are described as arrays under 'data.results', but there is no guarantee that these fields will always be present in the response. Therefore, the invariant 'size(return.variants[]) != size(return.dates[])' cannot be true for every valid request on the API.

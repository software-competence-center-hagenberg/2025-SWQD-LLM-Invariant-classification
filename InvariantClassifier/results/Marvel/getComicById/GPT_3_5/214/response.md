Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' is a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic by id.
- The 'comicId' is a required path parameter of type integer.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with an 'offset' property of type integer.

Invariant:
- input.comicId > return.data.offset

Analysis:
- The invariant input.comicId > return.data.offset checks if the 'comicId' in the request is greater than the 'offset' in the response.
- This invariant assumes a relationship between the 'comicId' and the 'offset', implying that the 'comicId' should always be greater than the 'offset'.
- However, there is no inherent relationship between the 'comicId' and the 'offset' in the API definition.

Conclusion:
- The invariant input.comicId > return.data.offset is a false-positive as it assumes a relationship between 'comicId' and 'offset' that is not specified in the API definition.

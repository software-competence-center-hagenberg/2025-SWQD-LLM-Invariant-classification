## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a property "data.results.thumbnail.extension" which represents the file extension for the image.

## Invariant
- The invariant is "return.thumbnail.extension one of { ""jpg"", ""png"" }", which means that the file extension for the image in the response should be either "jpg" or "png".

## Analysis
- The response schema does not enforce any specific values for the file extension. Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API because the response schema does not restrict the file extension to be only "jpg" or "png".

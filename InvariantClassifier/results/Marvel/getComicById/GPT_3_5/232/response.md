The invariant return.characters.returned >= size(return.textObjects[])-1 is false-positive. The reason for this is that the given Swagger definition does not provide information about the structure of the 'characters' and 'textObjects' fields within the 'data.results' response. Without knowing the exact structure and content of these fields, it is not possible to determine if the invariant holds true for every valid request on the API.

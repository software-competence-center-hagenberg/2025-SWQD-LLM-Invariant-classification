The invariant return.pageCount >= size(return.events.items[])-1 is intended to check if the number of story pages in the comic is greater than or equal to the number of returned events minus 1. The invariant type is daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterEqual, which represents an invariant of >= between two long scalars. The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

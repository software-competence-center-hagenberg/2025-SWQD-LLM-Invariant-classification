Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' has a GET method to fetch a single comic by id.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains comic objects with an 'issueNumber' field.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.issueNumber >= 0.0' specifies that the 'issueNumber' field in the response must be greater than or equal to 0.0.

Analysis:
- The response schema does not explicitly define the 'issueNumber' field as a double scalar, so the invariant may not be applicable.
- Additionally, the description of the 'issueNumber' field in the schema does not guarantee that it will generally be 0 for collection formats, which suggests that it could be negative in some cases.

Conclusion:
- The invariant 'return.issueNumber >= 0.0' is a false-positive because it may not hold for every valid request on the API due to the lack of explicit type definition and the possibility of negative 'issueNumber' values.

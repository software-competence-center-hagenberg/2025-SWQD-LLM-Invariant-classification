The given invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that the 'pageCount' and 'stories.available' fields are directly related, which may not be the case. The 'pageCount' refers to the number of story pages in the comic, while 'stories.available' refers to the number of total available stories in this list. These two fields represent different aspects of the comic resource and are not necessarily correlated. Therefore, the invariant 'return.pageCount != return.stories.available' is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

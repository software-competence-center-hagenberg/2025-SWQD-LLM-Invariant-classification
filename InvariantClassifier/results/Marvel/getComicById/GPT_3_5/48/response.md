Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' is a GET request to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a 'data' object with a 'results' array, which contains a field 'events' of type object.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.events != null' checks if the 'events' field in the response body is not null.

Analysis:
- Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'events' field is nested within the 'results' array, and it is not explicitly defined as a required field.
- Therefore, there is a possibility that the 'events' field may be null in some valid responses, leading to a false-positive classification for the invariant.

Conclusion:
- The invariant 'return.events != null' is classified as false-positive because it may not hold for every valid response on the API.

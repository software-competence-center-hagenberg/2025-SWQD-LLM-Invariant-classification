## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with properties such as 'data' and 'results'.
- The 'textObjects' field is nested within the 'results' array.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.textObjects != null' checks if the 'textObjects' field within the 'results' array is not null in the response.

## Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive because the 'textObjects' field is nested within the 'results' array, which is an array of comics. Therefore, the 'textObjects' field can be null for some comics while still satisfying the API contract.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant 'return.textObjects != null' is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

The given invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that the 'characters.available' and 'collectedIssues' fields are directly related, which may not be the case. The 'characters.available' field represents the number of total available characters in the list, while the 'collectedIssues' field represents a list of issues collected in the comic. These two fields may not have a direct relationship, and therefore, the comparison 'return.characters.available != size(return.collectedIssues[])' may not hold true for every valid request on the API.

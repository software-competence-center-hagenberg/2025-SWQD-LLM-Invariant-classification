## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The Swagger definition provides a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains a nested structure under "data.results.stories.items".
- The invariant checks if the field "resourceURI" in the nested structure is always a URL.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that "return.resourceURI" is Url, indicating that the value of the field "resourceURI" is always a URL.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided Swagger definition, there is no explicit validation or constraint on the format of the "resourceURI" field.
- The Swagger definition does not enforce that the "resourceURI" field must always be a URL.
- Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive as it assumes a constraint that is not enforced by the API.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive.

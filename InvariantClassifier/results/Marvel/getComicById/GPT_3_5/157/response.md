The invariant size(return.prices[])-1 <= size(return.images[]) is a comparison between the sizes of two arrays in the response body. It checks if the size of the 'prices' array minus 1 is less than or equal to the size of the 'images' array. The invariant type is daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntLessEqual, representing an invariant of <= between two long scalars. The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body. Based on the provided Swagger definition, the invariant is false-positive.

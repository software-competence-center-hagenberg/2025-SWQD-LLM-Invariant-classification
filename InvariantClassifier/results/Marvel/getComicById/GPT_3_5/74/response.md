Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/v1/public/comics/{comicId}' is a GET request to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response body contains 'data.results' which includes 'digitalId' and 'variants'.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.digitalId >= size(return.variants[])-1' checks if the 'digitalId' is greater than or equal to the size of 'variants' array minus 1.

Analysis:
- The 'digitalId' is compared to the size of the 'variants' array minus 1. This means that the 'digitalId' should be greater than or equal to the index of the last element in the 'variants' array.
- However, the schema definition does not guarantee that 'variants' array will always have elements, and if it does, it does not guarantee that the 'digitalId' will be related to the size of the 'variants' array.

Conclusion:
- The invariant 'return.digitalId >= size(return.variants[])-1' is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

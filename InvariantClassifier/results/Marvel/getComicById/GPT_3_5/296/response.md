## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}" has a GET operation to fetch a single comic by ID.
- The response schema includes a "data" object with a "results" array containing information about the comic, including the number of available stories and a list of prices.

## Invariant
- The invariant is: return.stories.available >= size(return.prices[])-1

## Analysis
- The invariant checks if the number of available stories is greater than or equal to the size of the prices array minus 1.
- However, the schema does not guarantee that the "stories" and "prices" arrays will always be present or have a specific relationship.
- The invariant assumes the presence of both arrays and a specific relationship between their sizes, which is not guaranteed by the schema.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive because it assumes a specific relationship between the sizes of the "stories" and "prices" arrays, which is not guaranteed by the API schema.

The invariant return.data.total == return.data.count is a false-positive for the given REST endpoint. The Swagger definition does not specify that the 'total' and 'count' fields are related in such a way that they should always be equal. The 'total' field represents the total number of resources available given the current filter set, while the 'count' field represents the total number of results returned by the call. These two values are not necessarily expected to be equal, and there is no indication in the Swagger definition that they should be. Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive.

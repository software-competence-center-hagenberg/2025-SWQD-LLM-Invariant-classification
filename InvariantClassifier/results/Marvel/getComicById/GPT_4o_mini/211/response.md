### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will include an `attributionHTML` field, which is a string. However, there is no specification in the Swagger definition that indicates the length of this string is fixed at 70 characters.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `attributionHTML` field in the response is always equal to 70 characters. This is represented as `LENGTH(return.attributionHTML) == 70`.

### Analysis
1. **Response Flexibility**: The `attributionHTML` field is described as a string, but strings can vary in length. The Swagger definition does not impose any constraints on the length of this string.
2. **Lack of Specification**: Since there is no explicit mention in the API documentation that `attributionHTML` will always be 70 characters long, we cannot assume this to be true for every valid response.
3. **Potential Variability**: The content of `attributionHTML` may change based on the comic being fetched, and thus its length could vary.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant claims a fixed length of 70 for the `attributionHTML` field without any supporting evidence from the Swagger definition, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The length of the `attributionHTML` field is not guaranteed to be 70 characters for every valid request.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic by its ID. The response structure includes a `data` object that contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has two properties: `collectedIssues` and `images`, both of which are arrays.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `collectedIssues` array minus one is not equal to the size of the `images` array. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:  
`size(return.collectedIssues) - 1 != size(return.images)`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Data**: The `collectedIssues` array is described as potentially empty for certain comic formats, while the `images` array is described as a list of promotional images associated with the comic. There is no direct relationship established between the number of collected issues and the number of images in the provided definition.
2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If `collectedIssues` is empty, then `size(return.collectedIssues)` is 0, leading to `-1 != size(return.images)`. This would hold true if there is at least one image. However, if there are no images either, then `-1 == -1`, violating the invariant.
   - If there are multiple collected issues and no images, the invariant could still hold true depending on the counts.
   - Conversely, if there are images but no collected issues, the invariant could also be violated.
3. **Lack of Constraints**: The invariant assumes a relationship between two independent arrays without any constraints or guarantees provided in the API definition. Since the API does not enforce any rules about the relationship between the sizes of these two arrays, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid response.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant is not universally applicable to all valid responses from the API. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

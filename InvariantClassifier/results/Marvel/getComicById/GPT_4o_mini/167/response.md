### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a comic by its ID. The response for a successful request (HTTP status 200) includes an object with a property `attributionText`, which is a string that contains an attribution notice. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `attributionText` field in the response should always equal "Data provided by Marvel. \\251 2022 MARVEL". 

### Analysis
1. **Response Variability**: The invariant suggests that the `attributionText` will always have a specific value. However, the Swagger definition does not specify that this value is fixed or that it cannot change. The description mentions that the attribution notice should be displayed, but it does not guarantee that it will always be the same string. 
2. **Potential for Change**: API responses can change over time, and the attribution text may be updated by the API provider. Therefore, it is not safe to assume that the `attributionText` will always be the same.
3. **Lack of Constraints**: The Swagger definition does not impose any constraints that would ensure the `attributionText` is limited to a specific value. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes a fixed value for `attributionText` without any supporting constraints in the Swagger definition, it is likely that this invariant will not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

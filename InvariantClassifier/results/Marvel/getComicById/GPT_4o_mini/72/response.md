### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array has a `digitalId` and a `textObjects` array.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.digitalId >= size(return.textObjects[])-1`. This means that the `digitalId` of the comic must be greater than or equal to the size of the `textObjects` array minus one.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Fields**:
   - `return.digitalId`: This is an integer that represents the ID of the digital comic. It can be 0 if the comic is not available digitally.
   - `return.textObjects[]`: This is an array that contains descriptive text blurbs for the comic. The size of this array can vary depending on the comic.

2. **Evaluating the Invariant**:
   - If a comic has no digital representation, `digitalId` will be 0. If there are no text objects, `size(return.textObjects[])` will be 0, making the invariant `0 >= 0 - 1`, which is true.
   - If a comic has a `digitalId` of 0 and one text object, the invariant becomes `0 >= 1 - 1`, which is also true.
   - However, if a comic has a `digitalId` of 1 and no text objects, the invariant becomes `1 >= 0 - 1`, which is true.
   - If a comic has a `digitalId` of 1 and one text object, the invariant becomes `1 >= 1 - 1`, which is true.
   - The invariant holds true for all combinations of `digitalId` and `textObjects` sizes as long as `digitalId` is non-negative.

3. **Counterexamples**:
   - The invariant could potentially fail if the API allows for negative `digitalId` values, but based on the description, `digitalId` is an integer that should not be negative in a valid context.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant `return.digitalId >= size(return.textObjects[])-1` holds true for all valid requests to the API based on the provided Swagger definition. Therefore, it is classified as a true-positive.

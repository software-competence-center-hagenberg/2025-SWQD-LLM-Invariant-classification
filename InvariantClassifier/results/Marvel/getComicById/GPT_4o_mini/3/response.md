### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Within each item of the `results` array, there is a `textObjects` array that is expected to contain items of a specific type.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.type` must be one of the following values: { "70th_winner_desc", "issue_preview_text", "issue_solicit_text" }. This implies that the `type` field within the items of the `textObjects` array can only take on these three specific string values.

### Analysis
To determine if this invariant is a true-positive or false-positive, we need to consider the following:
1. **Response Schema**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly define the allowed values for the `type` field within the `textObjects` array. It only describes the `type` as a string without constraints.
2. **Flexibility of API**: Since the `type` field is described as a string and there are no restrictions provided in the Swagger definition, it is possible for the API to return other string values that are not included in the invariant's specified set. This means that the API could potentially return values outside of { "70th_winner_desc", "issue_preview_text", "issue_solicit_text" }.
3. **Lack of Constraints**: The absence of constraints in the Swagger definition indicates that the API is not limited to the specified values in the invariant, making it likely that other values could be returned.

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition does not impose any restrictions on the `type` field and allows for the possibility of other string values being returned, the invariant is a **false-positive**. It cannot be guaranteed that the `return.type` will always be one of the specified values, as the API may return other valid string values not included in the invariant.

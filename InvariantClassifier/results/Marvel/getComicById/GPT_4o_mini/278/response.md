### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can contain two properties: `textObjects` and `dates`, both of which are arrays.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array minus one is less than or equal to the size of the `dates` array minus one. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

    size(return.textObjects) - 1 <= size(return.dates) - 1

This simplifies to:

    size(return.textObjects) <= size(return.dates)

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that for every comic resource returned by the API, the number of text objects associated with that comic must be less than or equal to the number of key dates associated with it. However, the Swagger definition does not impose any constraints on the relationship between the number of `textObjects` and `dates`. It is entirely possible for a comic to have more `textObjects` than `dates`, or vice versa, or even for one of them to be empty while the other has elements. 

For example, a comic could have:
- 3 text objects and 2 dates (violates the invariant)
- 0 text objects and 1 date (satisfies the invariant)
- 1 text object and 0 dates (violates the invariant)

Since there are no defined constraints in the API specification that guarantee the relationship stated in the invariant, it cannot be assumed to hold for every valid request.

### Conclusion
The invariant is not universally applicable to all responses from the API, as the relationship between `textObjects` and `dates` is not defined in the Swagger documentation. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

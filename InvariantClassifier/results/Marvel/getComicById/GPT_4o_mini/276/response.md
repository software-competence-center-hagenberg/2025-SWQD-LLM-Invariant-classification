### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have two properties: `textObjects` and `dates`, both of which are arrays.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array must be less than or equal to the size of the `dates` array in the response. This is represented as `size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.dates[])`.

### Analysis
The invariant implies a relationship between the number of text objects associated with a comic and the number of key dates for that comic. However, the Swagger definition does not provide any constraints or guarantees about the relationship between these two arrays. It is entirely possible for a comic to have more text objects than dates, or vice versa, depending on the specific comic being fetched. 

For example, one comic might have 3 text objects and 1 date, while another might have 1 text object and 2 dates. Therefore, there is no inherent rule in the API that ensures the size of `textObjects` will always be less than or equal to the size of `dates`. 

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, it is classified as a false-positive. The relationship between the sizes of these two arrays is not guaranteed by the API definition.

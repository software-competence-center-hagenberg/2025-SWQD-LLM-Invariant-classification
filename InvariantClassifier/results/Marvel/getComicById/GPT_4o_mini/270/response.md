### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource identified by `comicId`. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in this array can contain `stories` and `events`, both of which have an `available` property that is an integer representing the number of available stories and events, respectively.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.stories.available > return.events.available`, which means that the number of available stories must always be greater than the number of available events in the response.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests a strict relationship between the number of available stories and events. However, the API documentation does not provide any constraints or guarantees that the number of available stories will always exceed the number of available events. It is entirely possible for a comic to have more events than stories, or even for both counts to be equal. Therefore, there is no basis in the provided definition to assert that `stories.available` will always be greater than `events.available`.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant is not supported by the API's response structure and there are no constraints ensuring that `stories.available` will always be greater than `events.available`, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a comic resource by its ID. The response schema includes two properties: `attributionText` and `attributionHTML`, both of which are strings. The description indicates that either the `attributionText` or the `attributionHTML` should be displayed on screens that contain data from the API.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.attributionText` is a substring of `return.attributionHTML`. This means that the content of `attributionText` must appear within `attributionHTML` for every valid response from this endpoint.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests a strict relationship between the two fields in the response. However, the Swagger definition does not provide any explicit guarantee that `attributionText` will always be a substring of `attributionHTML`. It only states that either of these fields should be displayed, which does not imply that one must be contained within the other. There could be cases where `attributionHTML` contains additional HTML tags or formatting that do not include the plain text of `attributionText`, making the invariant potentially false. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes a relationship that is not explicitly supported by the API definition, it is reasonable to classify this invariant as a **false-positive**. There is no guarantee that `attributionText` will always be a substring of `attributionHTML` in every valid response from the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Within the `results` array, there are two properties of interest: `events` and `collectedIssues`. 

- **events**: This is an object that contains an `available` integer, which represents the total number of events available.
- **collectedIssues**: This is an array that lists issues collected in the comic. The description notes that this list will generally be empty for periodical formats such as "comic" or "magazine".

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.events.available == size(return.collectedIssues[])`, meaning that the number of available events should equal the size of the collected issues array.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**: The `available` field under `events` indicates the total number of events available, which does not necessarily correlate with the number of collected issues. The description suggests that for many comic formats, the `collectedIssues` array may be empty.
2. **Potential Scenarios**: 
   - If a comic has several events but no collected issues, the invariant would not hold (e.g., `available = 5` and `size(collectedIssues) = 0`).
   - Conversely, if there are collected issues but no events, the invariant would also fail (e.g., `available = 0` and `size(collectedIssues) = 3`).
3. **General Case**: The invariant implies a strict equality between two unrelated counts, which is not guaranteed by the API's design. The `available` count can be independent of the `collectedIssues` count.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes a relationship between `events.available` and the size of `collectedIssues` that is not supported by the API's description, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The counts can diverge based on the comic's format and the nature of the events and issues.

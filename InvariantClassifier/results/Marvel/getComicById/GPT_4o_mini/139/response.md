### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which has a `results` array. Within this array, there are two properties of interest: `variants` and `dates`, both of which are arrays. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `variants` array is not equal to the size of the `dates` array, expressed as `size(return.variants[]) != size(return.dates[])`. 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Data Structure**: The `results` array can contain multiple comic objects, each of which may have its own `variants` and `dates` arrays. 
2. **Potential for Equality**: It is possible for a comic to have the same number of variants as dates. For example, if a comic has one variant and one key date, the sizes of both arrays would be equal. 
3. **Lack of Constraints**: The API does not impose any constraints on the relationship between the number of variants and dates. Therefore, it is entirely feasible for both arrays to have the same length in certain cases. 

### Conclusion
Given that there are scenarios where the sizes of the `variants` and `dates` arrays can be equal, the invariant `size(return.variants[]) != size(return.dates[])` does not hold true for every valid request. Thus, this invariant is classified as a false-positive.

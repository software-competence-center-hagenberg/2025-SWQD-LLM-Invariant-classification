### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array is expected to have a `resourceURI` and a `creators` object. The `creators` object contains a `collectionURI` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.resourceURI` is a substring of `return.creators.collectionURI`. This means that for every valid response from the API, the `resourceURI` of the comic must be contained within the `collectionURI` of its creators.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Relationship**: The `resourceURI` is a unique identifier for the comic resource, while the `collectionURI` is a path to the full list of creators associated with that comic. There is no inherent relationship defined in the API specification that guarantees that the `resourceURI` of a comic will be a substring of the `collectionURI` of its creators. 

2. **Possible Scenarios**: It is entirely possible for a comic's `resourceURI` to not be related to the `collectionURI` of its creators. For example, `resourceURI` could be something like `http://api.example.com/comics/123` while `collectionURI` could be `http://api.example.com/creators/456`. In this case, `return.resourceURI` is not a substring of `return.creators.collectionURI`.

3. **Generalization**: The invariant attempts to generalize a relationship that does not necessarily exist for all comics and their creators. The API does not enforce any such substring relationship between these two fields.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant that `return.resourceURI` is a substring of `return.creators.collectionURI` does not hold true for every valid request on the API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

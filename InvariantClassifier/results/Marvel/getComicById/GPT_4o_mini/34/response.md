### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `data` object, which contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has an `images` property, which is itself an array of image objects. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.images != null`, which implies that the `images` property should not be null in the response. 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Response Structure**: According to the Swagger definition, the `results` property is an array. Each element of this array may contain an `images` property. However, it is not specified that the `images` array must always be present or non-null. 
2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If there are no comics found for the given `comicId`, the `results` array could be empty, leading to `return.images` being undefined or null. 
   - Even if the `results` array is not empty, individual comic objects within it may not have the `images` property defined, which could also lead to `return.images` being null. 
3. **Conclusion**: Since the invariant assumes that `images` will always be present and non-null, it does not account for the possibility of an empty `results` array or individual comic objects lacking the `images` property. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.images != null` is a false-positive because it does not account for the potential absence of the `images` property in the response, which can occur under valid API usage scenarios.

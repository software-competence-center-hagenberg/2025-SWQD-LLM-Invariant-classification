### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which in turn contains a `results` array. Each item in this array can have a `textObjects` array, which is described as a set of descriptive text blurbs for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.textObjects != null`, which implies that the `textObjects` array should not be null in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Response Structure**: According to the schema, `textObjects` is an array that is part of the items in the `results` array. The definition does not guarantee that every comic will have `textObjects` populated; it only describes the structure of the response.
2. **Possibility of Null Values**: The `textObjects` array can be empty or not present at all for some comics. The invariant assumes that `textObjects` will always be present and non-null, which is not guaranteed by the schema. Therefore, there could be valid responses where `textObjects` is either null or an empty array.
3. **Real-World Scenarios**: In practice, there may be comics without any associated text objects, leading to a situation where `textObjects` could be null or not included in the response.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes the presence of `textObjects` in all valid responses, which is not supported by the Swagger definition, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, as there are scenarios where `textObjects` could be null or absent.

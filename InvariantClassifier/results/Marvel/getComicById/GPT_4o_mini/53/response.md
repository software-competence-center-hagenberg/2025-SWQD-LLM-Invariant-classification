### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Within each item of the `results` array, there is a `dates` array that holds key dates for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `return.dates[]` array must be one of {2, 3, 4}. This means that for any valid response from this endpoint, the number of date objects in the `dates` array should only be 2, 3, or 4.

### Analysis
The invariant is asserting a specific constraint on the number of date objects that can be returned in the `dates` array. However, the Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the number of dates that can be included in the `dates` array. It only describes that the `dates` array is present and contains objects with properties `type` and `date`. Without explicit constraints in the API documentation, the size of the `dates` array could potentially be any non-negative integer, including values outside of {2, 3, 4}. Therefore, it is possible for the `dates` array to have sizes such as 0, 1, or more than 4, which would violate the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant imposes a restriction that is not supported by the Swagger definition, it cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Within this `results` array, there is a `prices` array that holds price objects for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `return.prices[]` array must be either 1 or 2. This means that for any valid response from this endpoint, the number of price entries in the `prices` array should only be 1 or 2.

### Analysis
The invariant is asserting a restriction on the number of price entries that can be returned. However, the Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the number of prices that can be included in the `prices` array. It only describes that the `prices` field is an array of objects, but it does not limit the number of objects that can be present in that array. Therefore, it is possible for the `prices` array to contain 0, 3, or more price entries, which would violate the invariant.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant restricts the number of prices to only 1 or 2, but the API does not impose such a restriction in its definition, this invariant is incorrect. Thus, it is classified as a false-positive.

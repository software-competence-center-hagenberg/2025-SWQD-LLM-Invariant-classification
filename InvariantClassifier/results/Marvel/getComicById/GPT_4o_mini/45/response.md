### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `stories` object that contains an `available` property, which is an integer representing the number of total available stories.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.stories.available >= 2`, which implies that the `available` field in the `stories` object will always be greater than or equal to 2 for any valid request to this endpoint.

### Analysis
The invariant is asserting a specific lower bound on the `available` property of the `stories` object. However, the Swagger definition does not specify any constraints or guarantees regarding the minimum value of `available`. It only states that `available` will be greater than or equal to the `returned` value, which is not defined in the provided excerpt. Therefore, it is possible for `available` to be 0 or 1, depending on the specific comic being fetched. Since there is no guarantee that `available` will always be 2 or more, the invariant cannot be considered true for all valid requests.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant `return.stories.available >= 2` is not supported by the information in the Swagger definition, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, as the `available` value could be less than 2.

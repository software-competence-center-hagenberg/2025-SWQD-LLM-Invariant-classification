### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `data` object containing a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array is expected to have a `digitalId` and a `stories` object, which contains an `available` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.digitalId != return.stories.available`, meaning that the `digitalId` of the comic should not be equal to the number of available stories.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Fields**:
   - `return.digitalId`: This represents the ID of the digital comic representation. It can be 0 if the comic is not available digitally.
   - `return.stories.available`: This represents the number of available stories for the comic.

2. **Possible Values**:
   - If `digitalId` is 0 (indicating no digital representation), `stories.available` could be any non-negative integer (including 0). Thus, the invariant could hold true if `stories.available` is greater than 0.
   - If `digitalId` is a positive integer (indicating a digital representation exists), `stories.available` could also be 0 or any positive integer. In this case, the invariant could also hold true if `stories.available` is not equal to `digitalId`.
   - However, there is a scenario where both `digitalId` and `stories.available` could be equal. For example, if `digitalId` is 1 and `stories.available` is also 1, the invariant would not hold.

3. **Conclusion**: The invariant `return.digitalId != return.stories.available` does not hold for all valid requests. There are valid scenarios where both values can be equal, specifically when both represent the same count of available stories or digital IDs. Therefore, the invariant is not universally true across all possible responses from the API.

### Verdict
The invariant is classified as a **false-positive** because it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

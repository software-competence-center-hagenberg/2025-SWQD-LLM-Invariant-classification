### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will be an object containing at least two properties: `copyright` and `attributionText`. Both properties are of type string, but there is no explicit relationship defined between them in the Swagger documentation.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.copyright` is a substring of `return.attributionText`. This means that the value of the `copyright` field must always appear within the value of the `attributionText` field in the API response.

### Analysis
To determine if this invariant is true-positive or false-positive, we need to consider the nature of the data returned by the API. The `copyright` field typically contains a legal notice about the ownership of the comic content, while the `attributionText` field is meant for displaying attribution notices. There is no inherent requirement or logical connection that mandates the `copyright` notice to be a substring of the `attributionText`. It is entirely possible for the two strings to be unrelated, and thus the invariant may not hold for all valid responses.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant requires a specific relationship between two fields that is not guaranteed by the API specification, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The API can return valid responses where `copyright` is not a substring of `attributionText`, making the invariant incorrect for all valid requests.

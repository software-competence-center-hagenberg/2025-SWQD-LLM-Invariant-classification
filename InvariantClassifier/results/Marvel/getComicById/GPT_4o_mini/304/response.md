### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which in turn contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has an `events` object, which includes an `available` property that is an integer.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.events.available` value can only be one of {0, 1, 2}. This implies that the `available` field can only take on three specific integer values: 0, 1, or 2.

### Analysis
The invariant is too restrictive based on the information provided in the Swagger definition. The description states that the `available` property represents the number of total available events in the list, and it is specified that this value will always be greater than or equal to the "returned" value. There is no indication in the Swagger definition that limits the `available` count to just 0, 1, or 2. In fact, it is reasonable to assume that the number of available events could be any non-negative integer, depending on the data associated with the comic resource. Therefore, the invariant does not hold true for every valid request on the API, as `available` could be any integer greater than or equal to 0.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the possible values of `available` to only three specific integers, while the API could return a broader range of values, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

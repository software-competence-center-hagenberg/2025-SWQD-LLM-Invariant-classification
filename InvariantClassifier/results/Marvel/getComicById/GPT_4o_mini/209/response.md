### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will include a property called `copyright`, which is of type `string`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `copyright` string in the response will always be 13 characters: `LENGTH(return.copyright)==13`. This is classified as a unary string invariant indicating a fixed length for the string.

### Analysis
The invariant assumes that every comic resource returned by the API will have a `copyright` string that is exactly 13 characters long. However, the Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the length of the `copyright` string. Copyright notices can vary significantly in length depending on the content, publisher, and other factors. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that every comic will have a copyright string of exactly 13 characters. 

### Conclusion
Since the invariant makes a specific claim about the length of the `copyright` string without any supporting constraints in the API definition, it cannot be considered universally true for all valid requests. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

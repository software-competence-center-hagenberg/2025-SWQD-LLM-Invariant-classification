### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array contains an `images` array, which in turn contains objects with an `extension` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.extension` must be one of the values: {"jpg", "png"}. This means that the `extension` property of the images returned in the response should only take on the values "jpg" or "png".

### Analysis
The invariant is asserting a restriction on the possible values of the `extension` property. However, the Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the values of the `extension` property. It only describes the structure of the response. Therefore, it is possible that the `extension` could take on other values (e.g., "gif", "bmp", etc.) that are not included in the invariant.

### Conclusion
Since the Swagger definition does not limit the `extension` values to just "jpg" and "png", the invariant is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can contain two properties: `dates` and `prices`, both of which are arrays.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `dates` array must be divisible by the size of the `prices` array, expressed as `size(return.dates[]) % size(return.prices[]) == 0`. This means that for every comic fetched, the number of dates must be a multiple of the number of prices.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Data Structure**: The `results` array can contain multiple comic objects, each of which can have its own `dates` and `prices` arrays. There is no indication in the Swagger definition that these arrays are related or that their sizes are constrained in any way.
2. **Possible Scenarios**: It is entirely possible for a comic to have a different number of dates than prices. For example, a comic might have 3 dates (e.g., onsale date, FOC date, etc.) and 2 prices (e.g., print price, digital price). In this case, `3 % 2 != 0`, which would violate the invariant.
3. **Lack of Constraints**: The Swagger definition does not impose any constraints or relationships between the `dates` and `prices` arrays. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the size of one will always be divisible by the size of the other.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant `size(return.dates[]) % size(return.prices[]) == 0` does not hold for every valid request on the API. There can be cases where the number of dates and prices are unrelated, leading to a situation where the invariant is false. Thus, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

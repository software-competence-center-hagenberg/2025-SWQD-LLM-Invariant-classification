### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each element in the `results` array is expected to have an `images` array that contains promotional images associated with the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the elements of the `images` array must not be null: `return.images[] elements != null`. This means that for every comic fetched, the images associated with it should exist and not be null.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Response Structure**: The response structure indicates that `data.results` is an array, and each entry in this array can have an `images` array. The invariant specifically checks that each element in the `images` array is not null.
2. **Possibility of Null Values**: The invariant assumes that every comic will have images associated with it. However, it is possible that some comics may not have any promotional images, leading to an empty `images` array or even a null value for `images` itself. If the `images` array is empty, the invariant would still hold true, but if the `images` field is null, the invariant would be violated.
3. **API Behavior**: The API documentation does not explicitly state that every comic will have images. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that there could be cases where the `images` field is null or the array is empty, which would make the invariant false.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes that all elements in the `images` array are non-null without any explicit guarantee from the API documentation, it is likely that this invariant does not hold for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

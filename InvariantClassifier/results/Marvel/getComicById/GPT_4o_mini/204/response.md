### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array is expected to have a `resourceURI` and an `events` object that contains a `collectionURI`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.resourceURI` is a substring of `return.events.collectionURI`. This means that for every valid response from the API, the `resourceURI` of the comic must be found within the `collectionURI` of the events associated with that comic.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Relationship**: The invariant suggests a specific relationship between `resourceURI` and `events.collectionURI`. However, the Swagger definition does not imply that there is a direct relationship between these two fields. The `resourceURI` is intended to identify the comic resource, while `events.collectionURI` is meant to provide a path to a collection of events related to that comic.
2. **Potential for Variability**: The `events.collectionURI` could point to a different resource or collection that does not necessarily include the `resourceURI` of the comic. For example, if the comic is part of multiple events, the `collectionURI` might not include the comic's `resourceURI` at all.
3. **Lack of Guarantee**: There is no guarantee in the API specification that `resourceURI` will always be a substring of `events.collectionURI`. This relationship is not defined or enforced by the API, making the invariant unreliable.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes a relationship that is not supported by the API's Swagger definition, it cannot be considered correct for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

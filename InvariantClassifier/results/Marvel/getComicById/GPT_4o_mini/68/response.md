### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The endpoint requires a path parameter `comicId`, which is an integer. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object with a `results` array, which includes `images`, an array of objects representing promotional images associated with the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.comicId > size(return.images[])`, meaning that the value of `comicId` must be greater than the number of images returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests a relationship between the comic ID and the number of images associated with that comic. Specifically, it asserts that the comic ID should always be greater than the number of images returned.
2. **Possible Values**: The `comicId` is an integer and can take any positive value (or zero, depending on the API design). The `images` array can be empty (i.e., size 0) if there are no promotional images for a comic. In such a case, the invariant would hold true if `comicId` is greater than 0.
3. **Counterexamples**: However, if a comic has a certain number of images (e.g., 5 images), the invariant would require that `comicId` must be greater than 5. This means that if a comic has an ID of 3, the invariant would not hold since 3 is not greater than 5. Therefore, there are valid scenarios where `comicId` can be less than or equal to the number of images, violating the invariant.

### Conclusion
The invariant `input.comicId > size(return.images[])` does not hold for every valid request on the API, as there are cases where the comic ID can be less than or equal to the number of images. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

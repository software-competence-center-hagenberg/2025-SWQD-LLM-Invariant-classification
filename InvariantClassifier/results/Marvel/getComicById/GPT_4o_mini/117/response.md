### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have two properties: `events` and `images`. 

- **events.available**: This property indicates the total number of events available for the comic. It is an integer that will always be greater than or equal to the number of events returned in the response.
- **images**: This property is an array that contains promotional images associated with the comic. The size of this array can vary depending on the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.events.available <= size(return.images[])`. This means that the number of available events should be less than or equal to the number of images associated with the comic.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests a relationship between the number of available events and the number of images. However, there is no indication in the Swagger definition that there is a direct correlation between these two values. 

- **Events**: The `available` count can be any non-negative integer, and it is not constrained by the number of images.
- **Images**: The number of images can also be zero or any positive integer. 

It is entirely possible for a comic to have a number of available events that exceeds the number of images. For example, if a comic has 5 available events but only 2 images, the invariant would not hold true. 

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API (as there can be cases where the number of available events exceeds the number of images), the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

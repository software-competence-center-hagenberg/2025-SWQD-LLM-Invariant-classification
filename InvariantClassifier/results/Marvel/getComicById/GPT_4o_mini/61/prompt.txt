Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/v1/public/comics/{comicId}"
  get:
    summary: Fetches a single comic by id.
    description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
    parameters:
      - name: comicId
        in: path
        description: A single comic.
        required: true
        type: integer
        format: int32
    responses:
      '200':
        description: This method fetches a single comic resource.  It is the canonical URI for any comic resource provided by the API.
        schema:

            data:
              type: object
              properties:
                results:

                  items:
                    events:
                      type: object
                      properties:
                        available:
                          type: integer
                          description: The number of total available events in this list. Will always be greater than or equal to the "returned" value.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.comicId > return.events.available

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.results" in the response body.

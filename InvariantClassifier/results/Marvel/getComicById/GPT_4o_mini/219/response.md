### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `data` object containing a `results` array. Each item in this array has an `events` object, which includes an `available` property that is an integer.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `available` field in the `events` object can only take on the values 0 or 1. This is expressed as: `return.events.available one of { 0, 1 }`.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that the `available` field is restricted to only two possible values (0 or 1). However, the description in the Swagger definition states that `available` is an integer that represents the number of total available events. This implies that `available` could potentially take on any non-negative integer value (0, 1, 2, 3, ...), depending on the number of events associated with the comic resource. There is no indication in the Swagger definition that limits `available` to just 0 or 1.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant incorrectly restricts the `available` field to only two values when the API documentation allows for a broader range of non-negative integers, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, as `available` can be greater than 1.

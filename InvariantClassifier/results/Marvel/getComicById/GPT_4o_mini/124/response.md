### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object which includes a `results` array. Within this `results` array, there are two properties of interest: `textObjects` and `urls`, both of which are arrays.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array minus one is less than or equal to the size of the `urls` array minus one, or mathematically, `size(return.textObjects[]) - 1 <= size(return.urls[]) - 1`. This can be simplified to `size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.urls[])`.

### Analysis
To determine if this invariant is a true-positive or false-positive, we need to consider the nature of the data being returned by the API. The invariant suggests a relationship between the number of text objects and URLs returned in the response. However, the API documentation does not specify any constraints or guarantees regarding the relationship between these two arrays. 

- It is possible for the `textObjects` array to be empty while the `urls` array contains multiple entries, satisfying the invariant.
- Conversely, there could be scenarios where the `urls` array is empty, but the `textObjects` array contains one or more entries, violating the invariant. 

Since the API does not enforce a specific relationship between the number of `textObjects` and `urls`, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant does not hold under all circumstances based on the provided API definition, it is classified as a **false-positive**. There is no inherent rule in the API that ensures the number of text objects will always be less than or equal to the number of URLs returned.

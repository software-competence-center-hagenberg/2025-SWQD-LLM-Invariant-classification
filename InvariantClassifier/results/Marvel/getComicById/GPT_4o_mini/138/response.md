### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have two properties: `urls` and `prices`, both of which are arrays. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `urls` array minus one is greater than or equal to the size of the `prices` array minus one. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

size(return.urls[]) - 1 >= size(return.prices[]) - 1

This simplifies to:

size(return.urls[]) >= size(return.prices[])

### Analysis
The invariant implies that for every comic resource returned by the API, the number of URLs associated with that comic must be at least equal to the number of prices available for that comic. However, there is no guarantee in the provided Swagger definition that every comic will have URLs and prices. 

1. **Comics with No Prices**: It is possible for a comic to have URLs but no prices, which would make the invariant hold true (e.g., size(urls) = 1 and size(prices) = 0). 
2. **Comics with No URLs**: Conversely, a comic could have prices but no URLs, which would violate the invariant (e.g., size(urls) = 0 and size(prices) = 1). 
3. **Comics with Equal Numbers**: If a comic has the same number of URLs and prices, the invariant would hold true.

Since the invariant does not account for the possibility of having no URLs or prices, it cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request to the API. 

### Conclusion
The invariant is not universally applicable to all responses from the API, as there are scenarios where it can be violated. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

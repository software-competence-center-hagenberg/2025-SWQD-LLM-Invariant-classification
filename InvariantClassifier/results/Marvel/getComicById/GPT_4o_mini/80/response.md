### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a comic by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object with a `results` array, which holds comic objects. Each comic object has a `digitalId` and an `images` array.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.digitalId >= size(return.images[])-1`. This means that the digital ID of the comic should be greater than or equal to the size of the images array minus one.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Fields**:
   - `return.digitalId`: This is an integer representing the ID of the digital comic. According to the description, it will be `0` if the comic is not available digitally.
   - `return.images[]`: This is an array of promotional images associated with the comic.

2. **Evaluating the Invariant**:
   - If a comic has no images, `size(return.images[])` would be `0`, making the right side of the invariant `-1`. Thus, the invariant would require `digitalId >= -1`, which is always true since `digitalId` is a non-negative integer (0 or greater).
   - If a comic has one image, `size(return.images[])` would be `1`, making the right side `0`. The invariant would require `digitalId >= 0`, which is also always true.
   - If a comic has two images, `size(return.images[])` would be `2`, making the right side `1`. The invariant would require `digitalId >= 1`, which is not guaranteed since `digitalId` could be `0` if the comic is not available digitally.

3. **Conclusion**: The invariant does not hold for all valid requests. Specifically, when a comic is not available digitally, `digitalId` will be `0`, which does not satisfy the invariant when there are images present. Therefore, the invariant is not universally true for all valid responses.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a **false-positive** because it does not hold for every valid request on the API, particularly when the comic is not available digitally and has associated images.

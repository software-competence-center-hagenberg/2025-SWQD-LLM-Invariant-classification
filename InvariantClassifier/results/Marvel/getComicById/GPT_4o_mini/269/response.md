### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object with a `results` array, where each item in the array has a `stories` object. The `stories` object contains two properties: `available` and `returned`, both of which are integers. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.stories.available >= return.stories.returned`, meaning that the number of available stories should always be greater than or equal to the number of returned stories in the response. 

### Analysis
The invariant is based on the description provided in the Swagger definition, which states that the `available` value will always be greater than or equal to the `returned` value. This is explicitly mentioned in the description of the `available` property, which states: "Will always be greater than or equal to the 'returned' value." Therefore, the invariant is directly supported by the API's documentation. 

### Conclusion
Since the invariant is explicitly stated in the API documentation and is a logical consequence of the definitions provided, it holds true for every valid request to this API endpoint. Thus, the invariant is classified as a true-positive.

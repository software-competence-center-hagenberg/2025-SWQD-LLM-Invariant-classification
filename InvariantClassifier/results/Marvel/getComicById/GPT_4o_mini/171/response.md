### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which in turn contains a `total` property of type integer. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.data.total == 1`. This implies that whenever a valid request is made to this endpoint, the total number of resources available (given the current filter set) will always equal 1. 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the `total` Property**: The `total` property represents the total number of comic resources available based on the current filter. It does not inherently indicate that there will always be exactly one comic available. 
2. **Possible Values for `total`**: The `total` could potentially be 0 (if no comics match the criteria), 1 (if exactly one comic matches), or more than 1 (if multiple comics match). The invariant suggests that the only valid state is when `total` equals 1, which is not supported by the definition. 
3. **API Behavior**: The API could return different values for `total` based on the `comicId` provided, and there is no restriction in the definition that guarantees `total` will always be 1. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant `return.data.total == 1` does not hold for every valid request (as `total` can be 0 or greater than 1), this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant incorrectly assumes a fixed value for `total` that is not guaranteed by the API's behavior.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that fetches a single comic by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array contains two properties: `textObjects` and `prices`, both of which are arrays.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array must be less than or equal to the size of the `prices` array in the response. In mathematical terms, this is represented as:  
`size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.prices[])`

### Analysis
The invariant suggests a relationship between the number of text objects and the number of prices associated with a comic. However, there is no indication in the Swagger definition that these two arrays are directly related or that one should always be less than or equal to the other. 

- **Text Objects**: These are descriptive blurbs for the comic, which may vary in number based on the comic's content.
- **Prices**: These represent different pricing options for the comic, which can also vary.

It is entirely possible for a comic to have multiple text objects but no prices, or vice versa. For example:
- A comic might have 3 text objects and 0 prices.
- A comic might have 0 text objects and 2 prices.
- A comic might have 1 text object and 1 price.

Thus, the invariant does not hold true for all valid requests, as there are scenarios where the sizes of these arrays can differ significantly.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant does not hold for all possible responses from the API, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The relationship proposed by the invariant is not guaranteed by the API's design or the provided Swagger definition.

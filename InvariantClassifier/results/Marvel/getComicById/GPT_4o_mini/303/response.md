### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in this array is expected to have a `thumbnail` object, which in turn has an `extension` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.thumbnail.extension` can only be one of the values: `"jpg"` or `"png"`. This means that any valid response from this endpoint must have the `extension` property of the `thumbnail` object limited to these two specific values.

### Analysis
The invariant is too restrictive based on the provided Swagger definition. The definition does not specify any constraints on the values that the `extension` property can take. It only describes the structure of the response and does not limit the `extension` to just `"jpg"` or `"png"`. Therefore, it is possible for the `extension` to be other values such as `"gif"`, `"bmp"`, or any other string that represents a valid image file extension. Without explicit constraints in the Swagger definition, we cannot assume that the `extension` will only be one of the specified values.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant imposes a restriction that is not supported by the Swagger definition, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The `extension` can potentially take on values beyond just `"jpg"` and `"png"`, making the invariant incorrect for every valid request on the API.

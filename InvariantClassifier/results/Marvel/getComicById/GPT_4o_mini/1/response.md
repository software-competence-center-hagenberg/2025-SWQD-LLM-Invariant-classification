### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array has a `prices` array, which contains items that have a `type` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.type` can only be one of the specified values: `"digitalPurchasePrice"` or `"printPrice"`. This implies that every `type` in the `prices` array must strictly be one of these two values.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that the `type` field in the `prices` array is restricted to only two specific values. However, the Swagger definition does not explicitly limit the `type` property to these values. It only describes the `type` as a string without specifying any constraints on what values it can take. Therefore, while it is possible that the API may return these values, it is also possible that other values could be returned, as the definition does not enforce any restrictions.

### Conclusion
Since the Swagger definition does not guarantee that the `type` will only be `"digitalPurchasePrice"` or `"printPrice"`, the invariant cannot be considered correct for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

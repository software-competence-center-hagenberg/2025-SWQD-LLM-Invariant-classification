### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which in turn contains a `results` array. Each element in the `results` array is expected to have a `textObjects` array, which is described as a set of descriptive text blurbs for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the elements of the `textObjects` array must not be null: `return.textObjects[] elements != null`. This means that for every comic fetched, the `textObjects` array should contain elements that are not null.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Response Structure**: The response structure indicates that `textObjects` is an array within each comic's result. However, the definition does not explicitly state that this array will always contain non-null elements. It only describes the structure of the `textObjects` array and its properties.
2. **Possibility of Null Elements**: The API could potentially return a comic where the `textObjects` array exists but contains null elements, or it could return an empty array. The invariant does not account for the possibility of the `textObjects` array being empty or containing null elements, which means that the invariant might not hold true for every valid response.
3. **API Behavior**: If the API implementation allows for null elements in the `textObjects` array or returns an empty array, then the invariant would be violated. The invariant assumes a stricter condition than what is guaranteed by the Swagger definition.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant `return.textObjects[] elements != null` is a **false-positive**. It does not hold for every valid request on the API, as the API could return null elements or an empty array in the `textObjects` array.

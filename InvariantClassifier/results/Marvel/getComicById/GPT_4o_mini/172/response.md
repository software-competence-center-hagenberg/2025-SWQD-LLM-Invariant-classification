### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which in turn contains a `results` array. The `results` array is expected to hold the comic resource(s) returned by the API call.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `return.data.results != null`. This means that the `results` field in the response should not be null.

### Analysis
According to the Swagger definition, the `results` field is defined as an array of objects. In JSON, an array can be empty but cannot be null. Therefore, if the API successfully fetches a comic, the `results` field will either contain one or more comic objects or be an empty array. However, it will never be null. 

This means that the invariant `return.data.results != null` is indeed correct because the `results` field will always be defined as an array, which cannot be null. 

### Conclusion
Given the structure of the API response as defined in the Swagger documentation, the invariant holds true for every valid request to the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

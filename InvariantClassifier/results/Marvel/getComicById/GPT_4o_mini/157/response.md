### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array has two properties: `prices` and `images`, both of which are arrays. The invariant in question compares the sizes of these two arrays.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `prices` array minus one is less than or equal to the size of the `images` array: `size(return.prices[]) - 1 <= size(return.images[])`. 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that for every comic fetched, the number of prices (minus one) should not exceed the number of images associated with that comic. 
2. **Potential Scenarios**: 
   - If a comic has no prices (`prices` array is empty), the invariant would imply that `-1 <= size(images[])`, which is always true since size cannot be negative.
   - If a comic has one price (`prices` array has one item), the invariant would imply `0 <= size(images[])`, which again is true as long as there is at least one image.
   - However, if a comic has multiple prices and no images, for example, if `prices` has 2 items and `images` has 0 items, the invariant would imply `1 <= 0`, which is false. 
3. **Conclusion**: The invariant does not hold in all cases, particularly when there are prices but no images. Therefore, it cannot be considered a true-positive invariant as it fails in certain valid scenarios.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it does not hold true for every valid request on the API, specifically in cases where there are prices but no corresponding images.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array contains an `images` array, where each image has an `extension` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `extension` of the returned images must always be equal to "jpg". This is a unary string invariant that suggests the `extension` field can only take on the value "jpg".

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The response structure allows for multiple images associated with a comic, and each image has an `extension` property.
2. **Possible Values**: The invariant asserts that the `extension` must be "jpg". However, the Swagger definition does not specify that the `extension` can only be "jpg". It merely describes the structure of the response without restricting the values of the `extension` field.
3. **Real-World Scenarios**: In practice, comic resources may have images in various formats (e.g., "png", "gif", etc.), and the API could return images in those formats as well. Therefore, it is incorrect to assume that the `extension` will always be "jpg".

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant makes a definitive claim about the value of the `extension` field without any supporting constraints in the Swagger definition, it is not guaranteed to hold true for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

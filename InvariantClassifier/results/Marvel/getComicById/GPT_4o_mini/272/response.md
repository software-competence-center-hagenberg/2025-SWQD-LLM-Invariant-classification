### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have two properties of interest: `stories` and `textObjects`. 

- `stories.returned`: This property indicates the number of stories returned in the collection, which can be up to 20.
- `textObjects`: This is an array that contains descriptive text blurbs for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the number of stories returned (`return.stories.returned`) is greater than or equal to the size of the text objects array (`size(return.textObjects[])`). 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that for every comic fetched, the number of stories should be at least equal to the number of text objects. 
2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If a comic has 5 stories and 3 text objects, the invariant holds (5 >= 3).
   - If a comic has 0 stories and 1 text object, the invariant does not hold (0 < 1).
   - If a comic has 0 stories and 0 text objects, the invariant holds (0 >= 0).
   - If a comic has 20 stories and 20 text objects, the invariant holds (20 >= 20).
3. **Conclusion from Scenarios**: The invariant does not hold in all cases, particularly when there are text objects present but no stories returned. This indicates that the invariant is not universally applicable across all valid responses from the API.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because there are valid responses where the number of stories returned can be less than the number of text objects, violating the invariant condition.

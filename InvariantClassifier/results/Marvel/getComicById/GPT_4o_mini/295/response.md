### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `data` object containing a `results` array. Each item in this array can have a `stories` object with an `available` integer property, which represents the total number of available stories. Additionally, there is a `textObjects` array that contains descriptive text blurbs for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the number of available stories (`return.stories.available`) must be greater than or equal to the size of the `textObjects` array minus one (`size(return.textObjects[]) - 1`). This can be expressed as:

`return.stories.available >= size(return.textObjects[]) - 1`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests a relationship between the number of available stories and the number of text objects. Specifically, it implies that for every comic, the available stories should be at least one less than the number of text objects.
2. **Potential Scenarios**: 
   - If there are no text objects (`size(return.textObjects[]) = 0`), the invariant would require that `return.stories.available >= -1`, which is always true since `available` is a non-negative integer.
   - If there is one text object (`size(return.textObjects[]) = 1`), the invariant would require `return.stories.available >= 0`, which is also always true.
   - If there are two text objects (`size(return.textObjects[]) = 2`), the invariant would require `return.stories.available >= 1`, which may not hold if there are no available stories.
   - As the number of text objects increases, the requirement for available stories increases, which may not be guaranteed by the API.
3. **Lack of Guarantee**: The API does not specify that there is a direct correlation between the number of available stories and the number of text objects. Therefore, it is possible to have a scenario where there are many text objects but no available stories, violating the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant does not hold in all cases, particularly when there are more text objects than available stories, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The relationship it asserts is not guaranteed by the API's response schema.

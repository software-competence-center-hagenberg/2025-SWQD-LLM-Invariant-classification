### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array is expected to have a `resourceURI` and a `stories` object. The `stories` object contains a `collectionURI` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.resourceURI` is a substring of `return.stories.collectionURI`. This means that the `resourceURI` of the comic should be contained within the `collectionURI` of the stories associated with that comic.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Relationship**: The `resourceURI` is a unique identifier for the comic resource, while `collectionURI` is meant to point to a collection of stories related to that comic. There is no inherent requirement or guarantee that the `resourceURI` of a comic will be part of the `collectionURI` of its stories. The `collectionURI` is likely to be a broader path that may not include the specific `resourceURI` of the comic itself.

2. **Possible Scenarios**: Consider a comic with a `resourceURI` of `https://api.example.com/v1/public/comics/123`. The `collectionURI` for stories could be something like `https://api.example.com/v1/public/comics/123/stories`, which does contain the `resourceURI` as a substring. However, if the `collectionURI` were `https://api.example.com/v1/public/comics/456/stories`, then the invariant would not hold. Thus, the relationship is not guaranteed and can vary based on the comic and its associated stories.

### Conclusion
The invariant that `return.resourceURI` is a substring of `return.stories.collectionURI` does not hold for every valid request on the API. There are valid cases where the `resourceURI` will not be a substring of the `collectionURI`, making this invariant a false-positive.

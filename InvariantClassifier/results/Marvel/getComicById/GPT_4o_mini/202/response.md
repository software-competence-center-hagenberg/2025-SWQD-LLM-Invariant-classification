### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array is expected to have a `resourceURI` and a `characters` object. The `characters` object contains a `collectionURI` field.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.resourceURI` is a substring of `return.characters.collectionURI`. This means that for every valid response from the API, the `resourceURI` of the comic should be a substring of the `collectionURI` of the characters associated with that comic.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Fields**: The `resourceURI` is a unique identifier for the comic, while the `collectionURI` is a path to a collection of characters related to that comic. There is no inherent requirement or logical connection in the API design that mandates the `resourceURI` of a comic to be a substring of the `collectionURI` of its characters.
2. **Possible Values**: The `resourceURI` could be something like `http://api.example.com/comics/123`, while the `collectionURI` could be `http://api.example.com/characters`. These two values do not have to relate in such a way that one is a substring of the other. In fact, they are likely to be completely unrelated strings.
3. **General Case**: Since there is no guarantee that the `resourceURI` will ever be a substring of the `collectionURI`, the invariant cannot hold true for every valid response from the API.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant that `return.resourceURI` is a substring of `return.characters.collectionURI` does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

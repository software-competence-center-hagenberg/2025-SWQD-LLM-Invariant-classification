### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array has a `digitalId` and a `prices` array. The `prices` array can contain multiple price objects, each with a `type` and a `price`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.digitalId != size(return.prices[])`. This means that the `digitalId` of the comic should not be equal to the number of price entries in the `prices` array for that comic.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding `digitalId`**: The `digitalId` can be 0 if the comic is not available digitally. This implies that if a comic is not available digitally, the `digitalId` will be 0.
2. **Understanding `prices`**: The `prices` array can be empty or contain multiple price objects. If there are no prices, the size of the `prices` array will be 0.
3. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If `digitalId` is 0 (comic not available digitally) and `prices` is empty, then `0 == 0`, which violates the invariant.
   - If `digitalId` is 1 (comic available digitally) and there are no prices, then `1 != 0`, which holds.
   - If `digitalId` is 1 and there is 1 price, then `1 != 1`, which violates the invariant.
   - If `digitalId` is 2 and there are 2 prices, then `2 != 2`, which violates the invariant.

Given these scenarios, the invariant does not hold true in all cases. Specifically, when the comic is not available digitally and has no prices, or when the number of prices matches the `digitalId`, the invariant fails.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.digitalId != size(return.prices[])` does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

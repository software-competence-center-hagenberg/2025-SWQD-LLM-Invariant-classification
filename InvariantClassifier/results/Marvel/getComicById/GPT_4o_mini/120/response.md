### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object with a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can contain two properties: `textObjects` and `urls`, both of which are arrays.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array must be less than or equal to the size of the `urls` array in the response: `size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.urls[])`.

### Analysis
The invariant implies a relationship between the number of text objects and the number of URLs associated with a comic. However, the API does not specify any constraints or guarantees regarding the relationship between these two arrays. It is possible for a comic to have multiple text objects and no URLs, or vice versa. Therefore, there is no inherent reason to assume that the size of `textObjects` will always be less than or equal to the size of `urls`. For example, a comic could have 3 text objects and 1 URL, which would violate the invariant.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, it is classified as a false-positive. The relationship between the sizes of `textObjects` and `urls` is not guaranteed by the API definition, making this invariant incorrect.

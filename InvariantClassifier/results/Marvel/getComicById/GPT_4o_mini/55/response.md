### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic by its ID (`comicId`). The response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in this array has a `digitalId` property, which represents the ID of the digital comic representation. If the comic is not available digitally, this `digitalId` will be 0.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter `comicId` should not be equal to the returned `digitalId` from the response. This is represented as `input.comicId != return.digitalId`.

### Analysis
1. **Valid Values for comicId**: The `comicId` is an integer that represents a specific comic resource. It is required for the request.
2. **Valid Values for digitalId**: The `digitalId` can be any integer value, including 0. If a comic is not available digitally, `digitalId` will be 0. However, if the comic is available digitally, `digitalId` could potentially match `comicId` if the comic's ID is the same as its digital representation.
3. **Counterexample**: Consider a scenario where `comicId` is 5 and the comic is available digitally with a `digitalId` of 5. In this case, the invariant `comicId != digitalId` would not hold true, as both values are equal.

### Conclusion
The invariant `input.comicId != return.digitalId` does not hold for every valid request on the API, as there are valid scenarios where `comicId` can equal `digitalId`. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a false-positive.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response structure includes a `data` object containing a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have two properties: `textObjects` (an array of descriptive text blurbs) and `prices` (an array of price objects). 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array minus one is less than or equal to the size of the `prices` array. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:  
`size(return.textObjects[]) - 1 <= size(return.prices[])`.

### Analysis
To evaluate the invariant, we need to consider the relationship between `textObjects` and `prices`. The invariant suggests that for every comic, the number of text objects (descriptive blurbs) should not exceed the number of prices by more than one. However, the API does not guarantee any specific relationship between the number of text objects and prices. 

- **Scenario 1**: If a comic has 2 text objects and 1 price, the invariant holds: `2 - 1 <= 1` (1 <= 1).
- **Scenario 2**: If a comic has 1 text object and 0 prices, the invariant does not hold: `1 - 1 <= 0` (0 <= 0).
- **Scenario 3**: If a comic has 0 text objects and 1 price, the invariant holds: `0 - 1 <= 1` (-1 <= 1).
- **Scenario 4**: If a comic has 0 text objects and 0 prices, the invariant holds: `0 - 1 <= 0` (-1 <= 0).

Since there are valid scenarios where the invariant does not hold (e.g., when there is 1 text object and 0 prices), the invariant cannot be considered universally true for all valid responses from the API.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it does not hold for every valid request on the API. There are cases where the number of text objects can exceed the number of prices, violating the invariant.

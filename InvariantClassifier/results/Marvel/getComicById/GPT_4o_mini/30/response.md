### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which in turn contains a `results` array. Within this `results` array, there is a `prices` array that holds price objects.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.prices != null`, indicating that the `prices` field in the response should not be null.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Response Structure**: The response structure indicates that `prices` is an array within the `results` array. The invariant suggests that this array should not be null.
2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If there are no prices for a comic, it is possible that the `prices` array could be an empty array (`[]`) rather than null. 
   - The invariant does not account for the possibility of `prices` being an empty array, which is a valid state for the API response.
3. **Null vs. Empty**: The invariant specifically checks for `null`, which does not encompass the case where `prices` is an empty array. Therefore, while `prices` may not be null, it could still be empty, which would not satisfy the invariant if interpreted strictly as `!= null`.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.prices != null` is a false-positive because it does not hold true for every valid request. The `prices` field could be an empty array, which is a valid response, thus making the invariant incorrect in its assertion that `prices` cannot be null.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in this array is expected to have a `variantDescription` property, which is a string that describes the variant of the comic if applicable.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `variantDescription` field in the response can only take on the values "GARNER VARIANT" or "WHITE VARIANT". This is a constraint on the possible values of the `variantDescription` field.

### Analysis
The invariant is too restrictive based on the information provided in the Swagger definition. The definition does not limit the `variantDescription` to only two specific values. It merely states that if the comic is a variant, the `variantDescription` will provide a text description of the variant. This implies that there could be many different variant descriptions beyond just "GARNER VARIANT" and "WHITE VARIANT". Therefore, the invariant does not hold true for every valid response from this API endpoint.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the possible values of `variantDescription` to only two specific options, while the API does not impose such a restriction, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. It does not accurately reflect the potential responses from the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the data returned includes a `results` array, which contains comic objects. Each comic object can have a `collectedIssues` array, which is described as generally being empty for periodical formats such as 'comic' or 'magazine'.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.collectedIssues[] == []`, which implies that the `collectedIssues` array will always be empty for the response from this endpoint.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that the `collectedIssues` array will always be empty, which is not necessarily true. While the description mentions that the `collectedIssues` array will generally be empty for periodical formats, it does not explicitly state that it will always be empty. There may be cases where a comic does have collected issues, depending on the specific comic being fetched. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request to the API, as there could be comics that do have collected issues.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant does not hold for all valid requests, it is classified as a false-positive.

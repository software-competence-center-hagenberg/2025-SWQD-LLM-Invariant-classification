### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response structure includes a `data` object that contains a `results` array. Each item in this array has two properties: `textObjects` and `images`, both of which are arrays. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array minus one is less than or equal to the size of the `images` array, represented as:  
`size(return.textObjects[]) - 1 <= size(return.images[])`.

### Analysis
To evaluate this invariant, we need to consider the possible values of `textObjects` and `images`:
- If `textObjects` is empty (size 0), then `size(return.textObjects[]) - 1` would be -1, which is less than or equal to any non-negative size of `images` (including size 0).
- If `textObjects` has one item (size 1), then `size(return.textObjects[]) - 1` would be 0, which is also less than or equal to any non-negative size of `images`.
- If `textObjects` has two items (size 2), then `size(return.textObjects[]) - 1` would be 1. For the invariant to hold, `images` must have at least 1 item.
- If `textObjects` has three items (size 3), then `size(return.textObjects[]) - 1` would be 2. For the invariant to hold, `images` must have at least 2 items.

This pattern continues, suggesting that the invariant holds as long as the number of `images` is at least one less than the number of `textObjects`. However, there is no explicit requirement in the API definition that guarantees a relationship between the number of `textObjects` and `images`. It is possible to have a scenario where `textObjects` has more items than `images`, violating the invariant. 

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not hold for all valid requests (specifically when the number of `textObjects` exceeds the number of `images`), it is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant cannot be guaranteed based on the provided API definition.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response for a successful request (HTTP status 200) includes a schema that contains a `data` property, which is an object. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.data != null`, which means that the `data` field in the response should not be null. 

### Analysis
Given the description in the Swagger definition, when a valid request is made to the endpoint, it is expected to return a comic resource. The `data` field is part of the response schema, and since the endpoint is designed to fetch a comic resource, it implies that the `data` field should contain information about the comic. Therefore, under normal circumstances, when a valid comic ID is provided, the `data` field should not be null. 

However, there could be edge cases where the comic resource does not exist (e.g., if an invalid `comicId` is provided). In such cases, the API might return a response with a `data` field that is null or an error response instead. Thus, the invariant `return.data != null` does not hold true for every valid request, particularly when the comic ID does not correspond to an existing comic. 

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.data != null` is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request to the API, especially in cases where the requested comic does not exist. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in this array is expected to have properties such as `title` and `variantDescription`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.variantDescription` is a substring of `return.title`. This means that for every comic returned by the API, the `variantDescription` should always be contained within the `title` of that comic.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**: The `title` is described as the canonical title of the comic, while `variantDescription` provides additional information about the comic if it is a variant. 
2. **Possible Scenarios**: There are several scenarios to consider:
   - If a comic is not a variant, `variantDescription` may be an empty string or not present at all. In such cases, the invariant would trivially hold as an empty string is a substring of any string.
   - If a comic is a variant, the `variantDescription` could be completely unrelated to the `title`. For example, if the `title` is "Spider-Man #1" and the `variantDescription` is "Director's Cut", there is no substring relationship between them.
3. **Conclusion from Analysis**: The invariant does not hold in all cases because there can be comics where the `variantDescription` does not relate to the `title` at all, especially for variants that have distinct titles or descriptions.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant that `return.variantDescription` is a substring of `return.title` is not universally true for all valid responses from the API. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array has an `images` array, which contains objects that have an `extension` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `extension` string in the response will always be 3 characters: `LENGTH(return.extension)==3`. This is classified as a unary string fixed length invariant, meaning it asserts that the string will always have a fixed length of 3.

### Analysis
The invariant is asserting a specific length for the `extension` field. However, the Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the `extension` string. It only indicates that `extension` is of type `string`. This means that the `extension` could potentially be any string value, including strings of different lengths (e.g., "jpg", "png", "gif", or even longer strings like "jpeg"). Without explicit constraints in the API documentation, we cannot assume that the length of `extension` will always be 3. 

### Conclusion
Since the invariant assumes a fixed length for the `extension` string without any supporting constraints in the API definition, it is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array is expected to have a `pageCount` property (an integer) and a `dates` property (an array of objects).

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.pageCount != size(return.dates[])`, which means that the number of pages in the comic (`pageCount`) should not be equal to the number of key dates associated with the comic (`dates[]`). 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Data**: The `pageCount` represents the number of story pages in the comic, while `dates` represents key dates associated with the comic. There is no inherent relationship between the number of pages in a comic and the number of key dates. A comic could have any number of pages and any number of key dates, including zero.
2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - A comic could have 0 pages and 0 dates, making the invariant false (0 != 0).
   - A comic could have 10 pages and 5 dates, making the invariant true (10 != 5).
   - A comic could have 5 pages and 5 dates, making the invariant false (5 != 5).
   - A comic could have 10 pages and 0 dates, making the invariant true (10 != 0).

Given these scenarios, it is clear that the invariant does not hold for every valid request. There are cases where `pageCount` can equal the size of `dates[]`, violating the invariant.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.pageCount != size(return.dates[])` is not guaranteed to be true for every valid request to the API. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

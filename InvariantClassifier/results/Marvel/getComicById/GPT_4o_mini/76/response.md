### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array has a `digitalId` and a `dates` array.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.digitalId != size(return.dates[])`, which means that the `digitalId` of the comic should not be equal to the number of dates associated with that comic.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding `digitalId`:** The `digitalId` is an integer that represents the ID of the digital comic representation. According to the description, it will be `0` if the comic is not available digitally.
2. **Understanding `dates`:** The `dates` array can contain multiple entries, each representing a key date for the comic. The size of this array can vary depending on the comic.
3. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If a comic has a `digitalId` of `0`, it is possible for the `size(return.dates[])` to be `0` as well, leading to `0 != 0`, which violates the invariant.
   - If a comic has a `digitalId` of `1` and has no dates, then `1 != 0` holds true.
   - If a comic has a `digitalId` of `1` and has one date, then `1 != 1` does not hold true.
   - If a comic has a `digitalId` of `2` and has two dates, then `2 != 2` does not hold true.

Given these scenarios, there are cases where the invariant does not hold true, particularly when the `digitalId` is equal to the size of the `dates` array.

### Conclusion
Since there are valid requests where `return.digitalId` can equal `size(return.dates[])`, the invariant is not universally true for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

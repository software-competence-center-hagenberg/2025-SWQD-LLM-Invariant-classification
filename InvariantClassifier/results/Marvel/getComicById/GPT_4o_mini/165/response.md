### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a comic resource by its ID. The response for a successful request (HTTP status 200) includes a JSON object with a property named `status`, which is a string. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.status` should equal "Ok". This implies that whenever a successful response is returned from this endpoint, the `status` field will always be "Ok".

### Analysis
While it is common for APIs to return a status message indicating success, the Swagger definition does not explicitly state that the `status` field will always be "Ok". The description of the response only mentions that it provides a string description of the call status. This leaves room for other possible values for the `status` field, such as "Success", "Completed", or even other error or informational messages in different contexts. Therefore, the invariant that `return.status == "Ok"` cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request, as there may be scenarios where the status could be something other than "Ok".

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes a specific value for the `status` field without explicit support from the Swagger definition, it cannot be classified as universally true for all valid requests. Thus, the invariant is a **false-positive**.

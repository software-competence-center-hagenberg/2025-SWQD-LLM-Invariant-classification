### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array is expected to have a `stories` object, which contains a `returned` field that is an integer representing the number of stories returned in the collection.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.stories.returned >= 2`, meaning that the number of stories returned must be at least 2.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that every valid response from this endpoint will always return at least 2 stories. However, the Swagger definition does not specify a minimum number of stories that must be returned. It only states that the `returned` field is an integer representing the number of stories returned, and it can be inferred that this number can be any non-negative integer, including 0 or 1. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the `returned` value will always be 2 or more.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant `return.stories.returned >= 2` does not hold for every valid request on the API (as it is possible to return 0 or 1 stories), this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a property `limit` of type integer. However, the definition does not specify any constraints or default values for the `limit` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.data.limit == 20`, which implies that the `limit` property in the response will always be equal to 20.

### Analysis
Since the Swagger definition does not specify that the `limit` must be 20, it is possible for the `limit` to take on other integer values. The absence of constraints means that the API could return different values for `limit` based on various factors such as pagination, user preferences, or other internal logic. Therefore, the invariant that `return.data.limit == 20` cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request to the API.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant is not supported by the Swagger definition and there is no indication that the `limit` will always be 20, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

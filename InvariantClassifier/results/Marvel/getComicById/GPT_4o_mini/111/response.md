### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Within this `results` array, there are two properties of interest: `events` and `textObjects`. 

- **events.available**: This property indicates the total number of available events related to the comic. It is specified that this value will always be greater than or equal to the "returned" value, but the definition does not provide a direct relationship between `events.available` and `textObjects`.
- **textObjects**: This is an array of descriptive text blurbs for the comic. The size of this array can vary based on the comic being fetched.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.events.available <= size(return.textObjects[])`. This means that the number of available events should always be less than or equal to the number of text objects returned in the response.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests a relationship between the number of available events and the number of text objects. However, the Swagger definition does not indicate that there is a necessary correlation between these two values. It is entirely possible for a comic to have a certain number of available events while having no text objects at all, or vice versa. For example, if a comic has 5 available events but no text objects, the invariant would be violated (5 > 0). 

### Conclusion
Since the invariant assumes a relationship that is not guaranteed by the API's response schema, it cannot be considered correct for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

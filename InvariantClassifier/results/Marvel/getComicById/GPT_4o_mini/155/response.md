### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which in turn contains a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have two properties: `dates` and `images`, both of which are arrays.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `dates` array is not equal to the size of the `images` array minus one: `size(return.dates[]) != size(return.images[]) - 1`. This is represented as a binary inequality between two scalar values.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests a specific relationship between the number of dates and images associated with a comic. It implies that for every comic, the number of dates should not be one less than the number of images.
2. **Potential Scenarios**: 
   - If a comic has 2 dates and 2 images, the invariant holds true (2 != 2 - 1).
   - If a comic has 1 date and 2 images, the invariant holds true (1 != 2 - 1).
   - If a comic has 0 dates and 1 image, the invariant holds true (0 != 1 - 1).
   - However, if a comic has 1 date and 1 image, the invariant fails (1 != 1 - 1).
   - If a comic has 0 dates and 0 images, the invariant fails (0 != 0 - 1).
3. **Conclusion from Scenarios**: The invariant does not hold universally for all valid responses from the API. There are valid scenarios where the number of dates and images can be equal or both can be zero, which would violate the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant is not universally applicable to all valid responses from the API. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

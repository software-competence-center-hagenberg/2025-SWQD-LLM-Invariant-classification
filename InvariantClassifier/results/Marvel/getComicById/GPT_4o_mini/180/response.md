### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have a `collections` array, which contains objects that have a `resourceURI` field.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.resourceURI` is a URL, specifically represented as `return.resourceURI is Url`. This means that every `resourceURI` in the `collections` array should always be a valid URL.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that the `resourceURI` field will always contain a valid URL. However, the description of the `collections` array states that it "will generally be empty if the comic's format is a collection." This implies that there may be cases where the `collections` array is empty, leading to no `resourceURI` being present. In such cases, the invariant cannot hold true, as there would be no `resourceURI` to validate as a URL. Furthermore, if the `collections` array is populated, there is no guarantee that the `resourceURI` values are valid URLs unless explicitly stated in the API documentation. 

### Conclusion
Given that the `resourceURI` may not always be present (due to the potential emptiness of the `collections` array) and that there is no explicit guarantee that the values are valid URLs, the invariant cannot be classified as universally true. Therefore, the invariant is a **false-positive**.

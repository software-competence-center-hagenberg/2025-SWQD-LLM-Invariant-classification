### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Within this `results` array, there are two properties of interest: `textObjects` and `collectedIssues`, both of which are arrays.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array minus one is greater than or equal to the size of the `collectedIssues` array minus one: 

`size(return.textObjects[]) - 1 >= size(return.collectedIssues[]) - 1`

### Analysis
To analyze this invariant, we need to consider the possible values of `textObjects` and `collectedIssues`:
- If `textObjects` is empty, its size is 0, and thus `size(return.textObjects[]) - 1` equals -1.
- If `collectedIssues` is also empty, its size is 0, and thus `size(return.collectedIssues[]) - 1` equals -1. In this case, the invariant holds as -1 >= -1.
- However, if `textObjects` contains one element (size 1), then `size(return.textObjects[]) - 1` equals 0. If `collectedIssues` is empty, the invariant still holds as 0 >= -1.
- The invariant will also hold if `textObjects` has more elements than `collectedIssues`. However, if `textObjects` is empty and `collectedIssues` has one or more elements, the invariant will not hold, as -1 will not be greater than or equal to 0 or more.

### Conclusion
The invariant does not hold for all valid requests because there are scenarios where `textObjects` can be empty while `collectedIssues` contains one or more elements. Therefore, the invariant is a **false-positive**.

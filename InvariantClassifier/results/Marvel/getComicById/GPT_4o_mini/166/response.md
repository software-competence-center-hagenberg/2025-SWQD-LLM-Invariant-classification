### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for fetching a single comic resource by its ID. The response for a successful request (HTTP status 200) includes a JSON object with a property called `copyright`, which is a string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `copyright` field in the response will always equal the string "© 2022 MARVEL".

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Copyright Field**: The `copyright` field is defined as a string, but the Swagger definition does not specify what values this string can take. It only indicates that it is a copyright notice.
2. **Variability of Copyright Notices**: Copyright notices can vary based on the comic being fetched. Different comics may have different copyright years, publishers, or other details. For example, a comic from 2021 would likely have a different copyright notice than one from 2022.
3. **Lack of Constraints**: The Swagger definition does not impose any constraints or fixed values on the `copyright` field. Therefore, it is incorrect to assume that it will always return the same value, as it can vary based on the comic resource being accessed.

### Conclusion
Given that the `copyright` field can vary and is not restricted to a single value, the invariant stating that `return.copyright == "© 2022 MARVEL"` is a false-positive. It does not hold for every valid request to the API, as different comics will have different copyright notices.

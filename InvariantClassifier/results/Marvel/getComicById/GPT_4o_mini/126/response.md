### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can contain two properties: `textObjects` and `prices`, both of which are arrays.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array minus one is less than or equal to the size of the `prices` array minus one, which can be simplified to:  
`size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.prices[])`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Data Structure**: The `results` array can contain multiple comic objects, each of which may have its own `textObjects` and `prices`. The invariant compares the sizes of these two arrays.
2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If a comic has no `textObjects` and no `prices`, the invariant holds true as both sizes would be zero.
   - If a comic has one `textObject` and no `prices`, the invariant would not hold as `1 <= 0` is false.
   - If a comic has no `textObjects` and one `price`, the invariant holds true as `0 <= 1` is true.
   - If a comic has one `textObject` and one `price`, the invariant holds true as `1 <= 1` is true.
   - If a comic has multiple `textObjects` and multiple `prices`, the invariant may or may not hold depending on the specific counts.
3. **Conclusion**: The invariant does not hold for all possible valid responses, as there are scenarios where the number of `textObjects` can exceed the number of `prices` (e.g., a comic with multiple text descriptions but no price).

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

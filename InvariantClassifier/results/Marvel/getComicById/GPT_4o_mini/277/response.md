### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response structure includes a `data` object containing a `results` array, which in turn contains two properties: `textObjects` and `urls`, both of which are arrays.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array minus one is less than or equal to the size of the `urls` array: `size(return.textObjects[]) - 1 <= size(return.urls[])`.

### Analysis
To evaluate the invariant, we need to consider the possible scenarios:
1. **Empty Arrays**: If both `textObjects` and `urls` are empty, the invariant holds as `-1 <= 0`.
2. **Non-empty Arrays**: If `textObjects` has one element and `urls` has one element, the invariant holds as `0 <= 1`.
3. **More Complex Cases**: If `textObjects` has two elements and `urls` has one element, the invariant fails as `1 <= 1` is false.

The invariant does not account for the relationship between the number of text objects and URLs, which can vary independently based on the comic resource being fetched. There is no guarantee that the number of text objects will always be less than or equal to the number of URLs, as the API does not impose such a restriction.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant is not universally true for all valid requests to the API. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

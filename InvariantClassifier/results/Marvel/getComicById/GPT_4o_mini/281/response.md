### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Within this `results` array, there are two properties of interest: `collectedIssues` and `dates`, both of which are arrays.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the sizes of the `collectedIssues` array and the `dates` array are not equal: `size(return.collectedIssues[]) != size(return.dates[])`. This is represented as a binary invariant of type `IntNonEqual`.

### Analysis
To determine if this invariant is a true-positive or false-positive, we need to consider the nature of the data returned by the API:
- The `collectedIssues` array is described as a list of issues collected in the comic, which may generally be empty for certain formats (like periodicals).
- The `dates` array is described as a list of key dates for the comic.

There is no explicit relationship defined between the number of collected issues and the number of dates. It is entirely possible for both arrays to be empty, in which case their sizes would be equal (0 == 0). Additionally, there could be scenarios where there are collected issues but no dates, or vice versa, leading to unequal sizes. However, there is also the possibility that both arrays could contain the same number of elements in some cases.

Given that there is no guarantee that the sizes of these two arrays will always be different, the invariant cannot be considered universally true. Therefore, it is not a valid invariant for all possible responses from this API endpoint.

### Conclusion
The invariant `size(return.collectedIssues[]) != size(return.dates[])` does not hold for every valid request on the API, as there are scenarios where both arrays can be of equal size (including both being empty). Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

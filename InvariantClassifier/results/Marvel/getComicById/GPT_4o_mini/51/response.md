### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Within each item of the `results` array, there is a `textObjects` array that can contain descriptive text blurbs for the comic.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `return.textObjects[]` array can only be one of the values {0, 1, 2}. This means that the API is expected to return either no text objects, one text object, or two text objects, but not more than two.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the `textObjects` Array**: The `textObjects` array is described as a set of descriptive text blurbs for the comic. There is no indication in the Swagger definition that limits the number of text objects to a maximum of two. The API could potentially return more than two text objects depending on the comic's metadata.
2. **Potential Scenarios**: For some comics, there may be multiple text blurbs available, which could lead to a situation where the `textObjects` array contains three or more items. The invariant does not account for this possibility, making it overly restrictive.
3. **General API Behavior**: In REST APIs, especially those dealing with collections or lists, it is common for the number of items returned to vary widely. The invariant's limitation to only three specific values does not reflect the flexibility typically found in such APIs.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant that the size of `return.textObjects[]` can only be {0, 1, 2} is incorrect. The API may return more than two text objects, making this invariant a false-positive.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that fetches a single comic resource by its ID. The response schema indicates that the response contains a `data` object, which includes a `results` array. Each item in the `results` array can have two properties: `textObjects` (an array of descriptive text blurbs) and `dates` (an array of key dates for the comic).

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `textObjects` array must be less than or equal to the size of the `dates` array minus one: `size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.dates[]) - 1`. This implies that there should always be at least one more date than text object in the response.

### Analysis
To evaluate the correctness of this invariant, we need to consider the nature of the data being returned:
- The `textObjects` array can contain zero or more items, depending on the comic.
- The `dates` array can also contain zero or more items.

There are several scenarios to consider:
1. **Both arrays are empty:** In this case, `size(return.textObjects[])` is 0 and `size(return.dates[])` is also 0. The invariant would evaluate as `0 <= 0 - 1`, which is false.
2. **`textObjects` is empty, `dates` has one item:** Here, `size(return.textObjects[])` is 0 and `size(return.dates[])` is 1. The invariant would evaluate as `0 <= 1 - 1`, which is true.
3. **`textObjects` has one item, `dates` has one item:** Here, `size(return.textObjects[])` is 1 and `size(return.dates[])` is 1. The invariant would evaluate as `1 <= 1 - 1`, which is false.
4. **`textObjects` has two items, `dates` has two items:** Here, `size(return.textObjects[])` is 2 and `size(return.dates[])` is 2. The invariant would evaluate as `2 <= 2 - 1`, which is false.

From these scenarios, we can see that the invariant does not hold in all cases. Specifically, when both arrays are empty or when both have the same number of items, the invariant fails.

### Conclusion
The invariant `size(return.textObjects[]) <= size(return.dates[]) - 1` does not hold for every valid request on the API, as demonstrated by the analysis. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a 200 status code. The response schema indicates that the response body is an object containing a property `data`, which is an array of items. Each item in this array is expected to be an object representing hotel offers, which includes a `hotel` object. The `hotel` object has a property `type` that is a string, describing the type of the hotel offer.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.hotel.type` is a substring of `return.type`. This means that for every hotel offer returned in the response, the `type` of the hotel should always be a substring of the overall `type` of the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Structure**: The response structure indicates that `data` is an array of hotel offer objects, each containing a `hotel` object. The `type` of the hotel offer is not explicitly defined in the schema, but it is implied that the `type` of the hotel is related to the overall type of the response.
2. **Potential Variability**: The invariant assumes a specific relationship between `return.hotel.type` and `return.type`. However, the schema does not guarantee that the `type` of the hotel will always be a substring of the overall `type`. For example, if `return.type` is 'hotel-offers' and `return.hotel.type` is 'luxury', 'luxury' is not a substring of 'hotel-offers'. Conversely, if `return.type` is 'luxury hotel-offers', then 'luxury' is a substring of 'luxury hotel-offers'. This variability indicates that the invariant may not hold for all valid responses.
3. **Lack of Constraints**: The schema does not impose any constraints or relationships between the `type` fields, meaning that the invariant cannot be universally applied without additional context or rules defining how these types relate to each other.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API due to the lack of a defined relationship between `return.hotel.type` and `return.type`. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/shopping/hotel-offers` which returns a response with a 200 status code. The response schema indicates that the `data` field is an array of `offers`, and each `offer` contains a `policies` field that is an object representing booking rules.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.policies != null`, which implies that for every valid response from this endpoint, the `policies` field within each `offer` must not be null.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The response structure indicates that `data` is an array of `offers`, and each `offer` has a `policies` field. However, the schema does not explicitly state that the `policies` field is required or that it cannot be null.
2. **Possible Scenarios**: It is possible that in some cases, an `offer` may not have any associated `policies`, leading to a `null` value for that field. The absence of a requirement in the schema means that the API could return an `offer` with `policies` set to null.
3. **Non-Zero Scalar**: The invariant type indicates that it is checking for non-zero values, which is typically applicable to numeric types. Since `policies` is an object, the invariant's description of being a non-zero scalar does not align with the expected type of `policies`.

### Conclusion
Given that the schema does not guarantee that `policies` will always be present and non-null, the invariant `return.policies != null` cannot be considered universally true for every valid response from the API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing a `data` field, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `price` object, which in turn contains a `taxes` array. Each item in the `taxes` array is an object that has an `amount` property, which is described as a string that defines an amount with a decimal separator.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.amount` is Numeric, which means that the `amount` field in the response should always contain characters that are numeric. This invariant is represented as `daikon.inv.unary.string.IsNumeric`, indicating that the string variable is expected to be numeric.

### Analysis
The description of the `amount` field indicates that it is a string that defines an amount with a decimal separator. This suggests that the `amount` can include characters such as digits (0-9) and possibly a decimal point (e.g., "12.34"). However, since the invariant specifies that `return.amount` must be strictly numeric, it implies that the `amount` cannot contain any non-numeric characters, including the decimal point. Therefore, the invariant does not hold true for all valid responses, as valid amounts can include decimal points, which would violate the invariant's condition of being strictly numeric.

### Conclusion
Given that the `amount` field can include decimal points and is described as a string that represents a numeric value, the invariant that `return.amount` is Numeric is incorrect. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

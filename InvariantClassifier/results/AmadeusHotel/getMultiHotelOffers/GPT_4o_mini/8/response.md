### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that accepts a query parameter `boardType`. This parameter is used to filter the response based on available meal options. The response schema indicates that the `data.offers` array contains items with a `boardType` property, which can take on a variety of string values, including those specified in the `enum` list.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the value of `input.boardType` (the query parameter sent in the request) should be equal to `return.boardType` (the `boardType` of the offers returned in the response).

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Input and Output**: The `boardType` parameter in the request is used to filter the offers returned in the response. However, the response may include offers with different `boardType` values than the one specified in the request.
2. **Filtering Logic**: The API does not guarantee that the `return.boardType` will always match the `input.boardType`. Instead, it is likely that the API will return multiple offers, some of which may not match the requested `boardType`. The filtering is based on availability, and the response can include offers with various `boardType` values.
3. **Possible Scenarios**: For example, if a request is made with `input.boardType = 'BREAKFAST'`, the response may still include offers with `boardType` values such as 'ROOM_ONLY' or 'FULL_BOARD' if those offers are available. Therefore, the invariant `input.boardType == return.boardType` does not hold true for all valid requests.

### Conclusion
Given that the response can contain offers with different `boardType` values than the one specified in the request, the invariant is not correct for every valid request. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/shopping/hotel-offers` that accepts a query parameter `currency`. This parameter is expected to be a valid ISO currency code, which is a three-letter uppercase string (e.g., 'USD', 'EUR'). The response for a successful request (HTTP status 200) returns an object containing a `data` property, which is an array of items. Each item in this array has a `self` property that is a string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.currency` (the currency parameter from the request) is a substring of `return.self` (the `self` property in the response).

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that whatever currency code is provided in the request must appear as a substring in the `self` property of the response. 
2. **Response Structure**: The `self` property is a string, but there is no indication in the Swagger definition that it will contain the currency code. The `self` property could represent a URL, an identifier, or any other string that does not necessarily relate to the currency.
3. **Currency Handling**: The description mentions that if a hotel does not support the requested currency, the prices will be returned in the hotel's local currency. This indicates that the response may not even reference the requested currency at all, especially if it defaults to the local currency.
4. **Example Cases**: For example, if the request specifies `currency=USD` and the `self` property returns a URL like `https://example.com/hotel/123`, there is no substring relationship between 'USD' and the URL. This shows that the invariant does not hold in this case.

### Conclusion
Given that there is no requirement or guarantee that the `self` property will contain the `currency` as a substring, the invariant is not universally valid for all responses. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

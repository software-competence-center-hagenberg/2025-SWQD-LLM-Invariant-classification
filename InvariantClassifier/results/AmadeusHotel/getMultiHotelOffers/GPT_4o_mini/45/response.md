### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing a `data` field, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `policies` object, which in turn contains a `cancellation` object. The `cancellation` object has a `type` property that is a string and is defined to only have one possible value: `FULL_STAY`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.policies.cancellation.type` should equal `"FULL_STAY"`. This is a specific condition that checks if the `type` property of the `cancellation` object within the `policies` of an offer is equal to the string `FULL_STAY`.

### Analysis
Given the Swagger definition, the `type` property of `cancellation` is explicitly defined to be of type string and is enumerated to only allow the value `FULL_STAY`. This means that any valid response from this API endpoint must have the `cancellation.type` set to `FULL_STAY`. There are no other possible values for this property, as it is constrained by the enum definition in the Swagger documentation. Therefore, the invariant accurately reflects the constraints defined in the API specification.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant correctly describes the only possible value for `return.policies.cancellation.type` as defined in the Swagger documentation, it holds true for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `room` object, which has a `typeEstimated` property. This property is itself an object that contains a `beds` property, which is an integer representing the number of beds in the room.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.room.typeEstimated.beds` can only take on the values {1, 2, 3}. This suggests that the only valid values for the number of beds in a room are 1, 2, or 3.

### Analysis
The invariant is overly restrictive based on the provided schema. The schema does not specify any constraints on the `beds` property other than it being an integer. Therefore, while the invariant claims that `beds` can only be 1, 2, or 3, the schema allows for any integer value, including values outside of this set (e.g., 0, 4, 5, etc.). There is no indication in the Swagger definition that limits the number of beds to just these three values. 

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not hold true for every valid request on the API (as the `beds` property can take on a wider range of integer values), the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

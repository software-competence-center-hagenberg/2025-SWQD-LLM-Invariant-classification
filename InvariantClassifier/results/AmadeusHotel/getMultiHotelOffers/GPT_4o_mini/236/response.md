### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines the structure of the response for the `getMultiHotelOffers` endpoint. The relevant parts of the response include:
- `data`: An array of offers.
- Each offer contains:
  - `price`: An object that includes an array of `taxes`.
  - `policies`: An object that includes a `deposit` object, which contains `acceptedPayments`.

The `acceptedPayments` object has a property `methods`, which is an array of accepted payment methods.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `acceptedPayments.methods` array minus one is divisible by the size of the `price.taxes` array, expressed as:

`size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]) - 1 % size(return.price.taxes[]) == 0`

### Analysis
To evaluate the invariant, we need to consider the relationship between the two arrays:
- `acceptedPayments.methods[]`: This array can vary in size depending on the offer and the accepted payment methods.
- `price.taxes[]`: This array represents the taxes applicable to the offer and can also vary independently of the payment methods.

The invariant suggests a specific mathematical relationship between the two arrays. However, there is no inherent requirement or logical connection in the API definition that dictates how the size of the `acceptedPayments.methods` array should relate to the size of the `price.taxes` array. For example, it is entirely possible for an offer to have multiple accepted payment methods while having no taxes, or vice versa. Therefore, the invariant could easily fail in many scenarios where the sizes of these arrays do not align as specified.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant imposes a specific divisibility condition between two independent arrays that do not have a defined relationship in the API specification, it cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

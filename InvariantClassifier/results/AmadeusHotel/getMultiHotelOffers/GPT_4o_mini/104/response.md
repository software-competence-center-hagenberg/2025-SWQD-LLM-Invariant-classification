### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing a `data` array. Each item in this array represents a hotel, which includes properties for `latitude` and `longitude`. Both properties are defined as numbers, which suggests they can hold any valid floating-point values.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the latitude of a hotel should not be equal to its longitude: `return.hotel.latitude != return.hotel.longitude`. This is classified as a binary invariant comparing two scalar float values.

### Analysis
The invariant implies that for every hotel returned in the response, the latitude and longitude must always differ. However, there are scenarios where this may not hold true:
1. **Identical Coordinates**: It is possible for a hotel to be located at a point where its latitude and longitude are the same (e.g., at the intersection of a latitude and longitude line). For example, a hotel located at (10.0, 10.0) would violate the invariant.
2. **Data Variability**: The latitude and longitude values are determined by the data source and can vary widely. There is no inherent restriction in the API definition that prevents them from being equal.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant `return.hotel.latitude != return.hotel.longitude` does not hold for all valid responses (as hotels can exist with identical latitude and longitude), this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. It is not a guaranteed condition for every valid request on the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing an array of offers. Each offer has properties including `rateFamilyEstimated` and `category`. The `rateFamilyEstimated` contains a `code` which is a string that can take values like 'PRO', 'FAM', or 'GOV'. The `category` is also a string that can take values like 'ASSOCIATION' or 'FAMILY_PLAN'. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `code` from `rateFamilyEstimated` should be equal to the `category` for each offer in the response. 

### Analysis
1. **Data Types**: Both `return.rateFamilyEstimated.code` and `return.category` are strings, which makes the comparison valid in terms of data types.
2. **Possible Values**: The `code` can be one of 'PRO', 'FAM', 'GOV', while the `category` can be 'ASSOCIATION', 'FAMILY_PLAN', etc. There is no defined relationship in the Swagger definition that mandates these two fields to be equal. 
3. **Lack of Relationship**: The invariant implies a strict equality between two fields that are not inherently related based on the provided schema. The `code` and `category` serve different purposes and can independently take on values that do not correlate with each other. 

### Conclusion
Since there is no requirement or relationship defined in the API specification that enforces `return.rateFamilyEstimated.code` to equal `return.category`, the invariant is not guaranteed to hold for every valid response. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `data`, which is an array of hotel objects. Each hotel object has two properties: `hotelId` and `chainCode`. 

- **hotelId**: A string that must match the pattern `^[A-Z0-9]{8}$`, meaning it consists of exactly 8 characters that can be uppercase letters or digits.
- **chainCode**: A string that must match the pattern `^[A-Z]{2}$`, meaning it consists of exactly 2 uppercase letters.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.hotel.chainCode` is a substring of `return.hotel.hotelId`. 

### Analysis
1. **Length Considerations**: The `hotelId` is always 8 characters long, while `chainCode` is always 2 characters long. For `chainCode` to be a substring of `hotelId`, it must fit within the 8-character string.
2. **Character Set**: The `chainCode` consists only of uppercase letters, while `hotelId` can contain both uppercase letters and digits. This means that while `chainCode` can potentially be a substring of `hotelId`, it is not guaranteed to be so.
3. **Example Analysis**: For example, if `hotelId` is `ADPAR001`, `chainCode` could be `AD`, which is a valid substring. However, if `hotelId` is `12345678`, then there is no valid `chainCode` that can be a substring of it. 

### Conclusion
Since there are valid cases where `chainCode` cannot be a substring of `hotelId` (e.g., when `hotelId` contains digits), the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

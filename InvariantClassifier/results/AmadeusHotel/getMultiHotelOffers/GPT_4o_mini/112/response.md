### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing an array of offers, each having a price object that includes a taxes array. Each tax in this array is represented as an object with a `percentage` field.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.percentage` is Numeric, which means that the `percentage` field in the response is expected to contain only numeric characters.

### Analysis
According to the Swagger definition, the `percentage` field is defined as a string. This means that while it may contain numeric characters, it is not guaranteed to be purely numeric. For example, the `percentage` field could potentially contain values like "10%" or "5.5", which are not purely numeric strings. Therefore, the invariant that `return.percentage` is Numeric does not hold true for all valid responses from the API.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because the `percentage` field is defined as a string in the Swagger definition, and it can contain non-numeric characters, thus violating the invariant that it must always be numeric.

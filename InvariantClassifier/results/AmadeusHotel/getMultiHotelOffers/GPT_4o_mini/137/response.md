### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `data` object containing an array of `offers`, each of which has a `policies` object. Within this `policies` object, there is a `cancellation` object that contains an `amount` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.policies.cancellation.amount` is Numeric, which means that this field should always contain a string representation of a numeric value.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The response structure indicates that `amount` is a string, but it does not guarantee that the string will always represent a numeric value. The Swagger definition does not specify any constraints or validation rules on the `amount` field, which means it could potentially contain non-numeric strings (e.g., "N/A", "Free", etc.).
2. **Lack of Constraints**: Since the Swagger definition does not enforce that the `amount` must be a numeric string, it is possible for the API to return values that do not conform to the invariant. For example, if the cancellation fee is waived, the API might return `"0"`, `"Free"`, or any other non-numeric string.

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition does not enforce that `amount` is always numeric and allows for the possibility of non-numeric strings being returned, the invariant that `return.policies.cancellation.amount is Numeric` is a **false-positive**. The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API because the response can include non-numeric strings for the `amount` field.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing an array of hotel offers. Each offer includes a room object, which has a property `type`. The `type` property is defined as a string with specific characteristics:
- It must be exactly 3 characters long.
- The first character is an identifier for the room type category.
- The second character is a numeric character indicating the number of beds.
- The third character identifies the bed type.
- There is a special case where the value can be 'ROH', which stands for 'Run Of House'.

The pattern for the `type` property is defined as `^[A-Z0-9*]{3}$`, which indicates that it must consist of 3 characters that can be uppercase letters, digits, or an asterisk.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `return.room.type` is always equal to 3: `LENGTH(return.room.type)==3`. This is a specific assertion about the length of the string returned in the `type` property of the room object.

### Analysis
Given the definition of the `type` property in the Swagger documentation, it is clear that the `type` must always be 3 characters long, as indicated by the pattern and the description provided. The invariant aligns perfectly with the constraints outlined in the Swagger definition. There are no exceptions or conditions under which the length of `type` could be anything other than 3 characters. Therefore, the invariant holds true for every valid response from this endpoint.

### Conclusion
The invariant `LENGTH(return.room.type)==3` is a true-positive because it accurately reflects the constraints defined in the Swagger documentation for the `type` property of the room object in the response.

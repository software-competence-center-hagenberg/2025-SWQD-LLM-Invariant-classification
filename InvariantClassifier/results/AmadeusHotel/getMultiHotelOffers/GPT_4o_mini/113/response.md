### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing a `data` object, which includes an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `price` object, which in turn has a `variations` object. Within `variations`, there is an array called `changes`, where each item in this array has a `startDate` property.

The `startDate` property is defined as a string with a description indicating that it represents the beginning date of a period, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.startDate` is a Date in the format `YYYY/MM/DD`. 

### Analysis
1. **Format Mismatch**: The invariant specifies the date format as `YYYY/MM/DD`, while the Swagger definition specifies the format as `YYYY-MM-DD`. This is a critical discrepancy because it indicates that the invariant is expecting a different format than what is defined in the API response.
2. **Type Assertion**: The invariant also asserts that `return.startDate` is a Date. However, the Swagger definition indicates that `startDate` is a string, not a Date object. This further confirms that the invariant does not align with the API's response structure.

### Conclusion
Given the mismatch in date format and the type of the `startDate` property, the invariant is incorrect and will not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing an array of offers, each with price information. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that within the `price` object, there is a `variations` object that contains an array of `changes`. Each `change` in this array has two properties: `total` and `base`, both of which are strings.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.total == return.base`, which means that for each `change` in the `variations.changes` array, the `total` value should be equal to the `base` value.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Fields**: The `total` is described as the sum of `base` and `totalTaxes`. This implies that `total` should generally be greater than or equal to `base`, depending on whether `totalTaxes` is zero or not.
2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If `totalTaxes` is zero, then `total` could equal `base`, making the invariant true in this case.
   - If `totalTaxes` is greater than zero, then `total` will be greater than `base`, making the invariant false in this case.
3. **Conclusion**: Since the invariant `return.total == return.base` does not hold in all scenarios (specifically when there are taxes), it cannot be considered universally true for every valid response from the API.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a **false-positive** because it does not hold for every valid request on the API, particularly when taxes are involved in the pricing structure.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing a `data` field, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `price` object, which in turn has a `taxes` array. Each item in the `taxes` array is expected to have a `pricingMode` field.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.pricingMode` must be one of the values: `"PER_OCCUPANT"` or `"PER_PRODUCT"`. This is a restriction on the possible values that the `pricingMode` field can take in the response.

### Analysis
According to the Swagger definition, the `pricingMode` field is explicitly defined to be a string with a description that includes the values `PER_OCCUPANT` and `PER_PRODUCT`. Since these are the only values mentioned in the schema, it implies that any valid response for the `pricingMode` field must conform to this specification. Therefore, the invariant accurately reflects the constraints imposed by the Swagger definition.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant correctly captures the allowed values for the `pricingMode` field as defined in the Swagger documentation, it can be classified as a **true-positive**. This means that the invariant holds for every valid request on the API, as the response will always include the `pricingMode` with one of the specified values.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that each offer contains a `checkInDate` and a `policies` object, which in turn contains a `holdTime` object with a `deadline` property. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.checkInDate` is a substring of `return.policies.holdTime.deadline`. This means that the check-in date should appear within the hold time deadline string. 

### Analysis
1. **Check-in Date Format**: The `checkInDate` is specified to be in the format YYYY-MM-DD, while the `deadline` is in ISO 8601 format (which includes date and time). 
2. **Substring Relationship**: For `checkInDate` to be a substring of `deadline`, the date portion of `deadline` must match the format of `checkInDate`. However, the `deadline` includes time information and is formatted as `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`, which means that the check-in date will not match the substring requirement unless the time component is ignored. 
3. **Possible Values**: If `checkInDate` is, for example, `2020-12-30`, the corresponding `deadline` could be `2020-12-30T13:00:00`. In this case, `checkInDate` is indeed a substring of `deadline`. However, if the `deadline` were to be formatted differently or include additional characters, the invariant may not hold. 
4. **General Case**: The invariant does not hold universally because there could be cases where the `deadline` does not contain the `checkInDate` as a substring, especially if the `deadline` includes additional characters or formatting that disrupts the substring relationship. 

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant that `return.checkInDate` is a substring of `return.policies.holdTime.deadline` does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

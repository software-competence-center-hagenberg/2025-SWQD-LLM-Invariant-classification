## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/shopping/hotel-offers` that accepts a query parameter `checkInDate`. This parameter is a string formatted as a date (YYYY-MM-DD) and must be today or a future date. The response for a successful request (HTTP status 200) is an object containing a property `data`, which is an array of items. Each item in this array has a property `self`, which is also a string.

## Invariant
The invariant states that `input.checkInDate` is a substring of `return.self`. This means that the value provided for `checkInDate` in the request should appear within the string returned in the `self` property of the response.

## Analysis
1. **Input Parameter**: The `checkInDate` is a date string that represents the check-in date for hotel offers.
2. **Response Structure**: The response contains an array of objects, each with a `self` property which is a string. There is no explicit requirement or relationship defined in the Swagger documentation that indicates that the `checkInDate` must be included in the `self` string.
3. **Possible Values**: The `self` property could contain various strings that do not necessarily relate to the `checkInDate`. For example, it could be a URL or an identifier that does not include the check-in date.

Given that there is no direct relationship established between `checkInDate` and the `self` property in the response, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request. It is possible to receive a response where `self` does not contain the `checkInDate` as a substring.

## Conclusion
The invariant that `input.checkInDate` is a substring of `return.self` is not supported by the API definition. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing an array of offers. Each offer contains a `policies` object, which in turn has a `cancellation` object. The `cancellation` object has a `description` property that is itself an object containing a `text` property, which is a string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.policies.cancellation.description.text` must be one of the following values: "NON-REFUNDABLE RATE", "Non refundable rate", or "Plus Taxes and fees where appropriate." This implies that the `text` field can only take on these specific string values.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that the `text` property of the `description` object is restricted to a specific set of strings. However, the Swagger definition does not provide any constraints or enumerations for the `text` property. This means that while the API may return these values, it is not guaranteed that these are the only values that can be returned. The `text` property could potentially contain any string, as there are no restrictions defined in the Swagger documentation.

### Conclusion
Since the Swagger definition does not enforce that the `text` property can only take on the specified values, the invariant is not correct. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** because it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

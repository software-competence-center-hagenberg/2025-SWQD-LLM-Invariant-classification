### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that accepts a query parameter `roomQuantity`, which specifies the number of rooms requested (between 1 and 9). The response schema indicates that the response will contain an array of offers, each with a `price` object that includes a `variations` object. This `variations` object contains an array called `changes`, which represents price periods with various properties including `startDate`, `endDate`, `currency`, `sellingTotal`, `total`, and `base`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter `roomQuantity` should not equal the size of the `changes` array minus one. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

`roomQuantity != size(variations.changes) - 1`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the number of rooms requested (`roomQuantity`) should not be equal to the number of price change periods minus one. This implies that if there are `n` changes in price, the invariant would hold if `roomQuantity` is not equal to `n - 1`.

2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If `roomQuantity` is 1, the invariant would hold true if there are 2 or more changes in price (since 1 != 2 - 1).
   - If `roomQuantity` is 2, the invariant would hold true if there are 3 or more changes in price (since 2 != 3 - 1).
   - However, if there is only 1 change in price, `roomQuantity` of 1 would violate the invariant (1 == 1 - 1).
   - If `roomQuantity` is 9 and there are 9 changes, the invariant would also be violated (9 == 9 - 1).

3. **Conclusion**: The invariant does not hold for all valid requests. There are scenarios where the number of room requests can equal the size of the `changes` array minus one, leading to a violation of the invariant. Therefore, the invariant is not universally applicable to all valid requests.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a **false-positive** because it does not hold for every valid request on the API. There are valid scenarios where `roomQuantity` can equal `size(variations.changes) - 1`, thus violating the invariant.

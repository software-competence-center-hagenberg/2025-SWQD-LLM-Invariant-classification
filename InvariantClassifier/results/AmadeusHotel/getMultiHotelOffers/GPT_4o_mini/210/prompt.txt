Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    policies:
                      type: object
                      description: Booking Rules
                      properties:
                        cancellation:
                          type: object
                          properties:
                            numberOfNights:
                              type: integer
                              description: Number of nights due as fee in case of cancellation.

Invariant: return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights >= 1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.LowerBound
Invariant description: Represents the invariant x >= c, where c is a constant and x is a long scalar.

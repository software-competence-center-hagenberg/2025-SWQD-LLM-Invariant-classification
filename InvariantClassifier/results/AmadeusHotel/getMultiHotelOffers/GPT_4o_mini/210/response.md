### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing an array of offers. Each offer has a `policies` object, which includes a `cancellation` object. Within the `cancellation` object, there is a property `numberOfNights` that is defined as an integer.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights >= 1`. This means that for every valid response from the API, the `numberOfNights` value under the `cancellation` policy must be at least 1.

### Analysis
The invariant implies that every offer's cancellation policy must have a `numberOfNights` value that is 1 or greater. However, the Swagger definition does not specify any constraints or requirements on the `numberOfNights` property. It is possible for the API to return a `numberOfNights` value of 0 or even a negative value if the implementation allows it, as there are no explicit restrictions in the schema. Therefore, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid response.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant `return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights >= 1` is not supported by the Swagger definition and there are no constraints ensuring that `numberOfNights` will always be 1 or greater, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing an array of hotel offers. Each offer includes a room object, which has a property `typeEstimated`. This property contains further details about the room, including the `beds` property, which is an integer representing the number of beds in the room.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the value of `return.room.typeEstimated.beds` must be one of the values {1, 2}. This means that for every valid response from this endpoint, the number of beds in the room must either be 1 or 2.

### Analysis
The invariant is asserting a restriction on the possible values of the `beds` property. However, the Swagger definition does not impose any such restriction. The description of the `beds` property indicates that it can take on values from 1 to 9. Therefore, the invariant that restricts the value to only 1 or 2 is not supported by the API definition. The API could return rooms with 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 beds, which would violate the invariant.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not hold for every valid response from the API, it is classified as a false-positive. The API can return a wider range of values for the `beds` property than what the invariant specifies.

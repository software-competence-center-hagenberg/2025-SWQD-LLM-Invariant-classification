### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a REST API endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the response will include an array of offers, each containing a policies object. Within the policies object, there are two properties: `deposit` and `cancellation`. The `deposit` property includes an `acceptedPayments` object, which is an array of strings representing various accepted payment methods. The `cancellation` property includes a `description` object, which contains a `text` field.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.policies.cancellation.description.text` is always a member of the array `return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]`. In other words, it asserts that the cancellation description text will always be one of the accepted payment methods listed in the deposit policies.

### Analysis
1. **Nature of Fields**: The `acceptedPayments.methods` array is explicitly defined to contain various payment methods, such as CREDIT_CARD, CHECK, etc. These are specific payment methods that can be used for booking.
2. **Cancellation Description**: The `cancellation.description.text` field is a free text field that can contain any string, as indicated by its type being a string. There is no restriction or predefined set of values for this field, meaning it can contain any arbitrary text.
3. **Membership Condition**: Since the cancellation description text can be any string, it is not guaranteed to match any of the predefined payment methods in the `acceptedPayments.methods` array. Therefore, it is entirely possible for `cancellation.description.text` to contain a value that is not present in the `acceptedPayments.methods[]` array.

### Conclusion
Given that the cancellation description text can be arbitrary and does not have to match any of the accepted payment methods, the invariant that it is always a member of the accepted payments array is incorrect. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

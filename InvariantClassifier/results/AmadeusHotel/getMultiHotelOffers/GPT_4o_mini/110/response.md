### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that the `taxes` property is an array of objects, each containing a `currency` property. The `currency` property is defined as a string with a description indicating it should be a three-letter currency code (e.g., EUR, USD).

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `currency` string in the response must always equal 3: `LENGTH(return.currency) == 3`. This is categorized as a fixed-length string invariant.

### Analysis
The invariant is based on the description provided in the Swagger definition, which specifies that the `currency` is a three-letter code. However, while the definition implies that valid currency codes should conform to this length, it does not enforce it strictly. There may be cases where the `currency` field could be empty or contain invalid values that do not meet the specified length requirement. Additionally, if the API implementation does not validate the length of the `currency` string before returning it, this invariant may not hold true for all valid responses.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes a strict enforcement of a three-character length for the `currency` field, which may not be guaranteed by the API's implementation, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. There could be valid responses where the `currency` does not meet the specified length, thus violating the invariant.

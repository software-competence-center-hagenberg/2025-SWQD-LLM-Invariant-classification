### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a 200 status code. The response schema indicates that the response body is an object containing a `data` property, which is an array of items. Each item in this array has a `type` property (which is a string) and a `self` property (which is also a string).

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.type` is a substring of `return.self`. This means that for every item in the `data` array of the response, the value of the `type` property should be a substring of the value of the `self` property.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**: The `type` property is described as "the type of the object (hotel-offers)". This suggests that it will always return a specific string value, likely "hotel-offers". The `self` property is a string that presumably contains a URL or identifier related to the hotel offer.
2. **Substring Relationship**: For the invariant to hold true, every possible value of `return.type` must be a substring of the corresponding `return.self` value. However, since `self` is likely to be a URL or a more complex identifier, it is not guaranteed that the static string "hotel-offers" will always be a substring of every possible `self` value. For example, if `self` is "https://api.example.com/hotel-offers/123", then "hotel-offers" is indeed a substring. But if `self` were something like "https://api.example.com/rooms/123", then it would not be a substring.
3. **Variability of `self`**: The variability of the `self` property means that there could be cases where the invariant does not hold. Since `self` can represent different URLs or identifiers, it is not safe to assume that `type` will always be a substring of `self`.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant that `return.type` is a substring of `return.self` does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

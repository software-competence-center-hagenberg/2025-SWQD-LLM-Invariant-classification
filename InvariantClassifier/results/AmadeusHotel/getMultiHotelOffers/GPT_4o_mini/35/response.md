### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the response will contain a `data` object, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `policies` object, which includes a `paymentType` property. The `paymentType` can take on several string values as defined by the `enum`:
- GUARANTEE
- DEPOSIT
- PREPAY
- HOLDTIME
- guarantee
- deposit
- prepay
- holdtime

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `paymentType` will only be one of the values: "deposit" or "guarantee".

### Analysis
The invariant is too restrictive based on the Swagger definition. The `paymentType` can take on multiple values, including but not limited to "deposit" and "guarantee". The presence of other valid values such as "prepay", "holdtime", and their lowercase variants means that the invariant does not hold for every valid response. Therefore, it is possible to receive a `paymentType` that is neither "deposit" nor "guarantee".

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant does not account for all possible valid values of `paymentType` as defined in the Swagger specification, it is classified as a false-positive.

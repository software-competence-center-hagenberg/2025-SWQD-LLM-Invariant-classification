### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing a `data` field, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `room` object, which in turn has a `description` property that is defined as an object. The description is meant to convey a list of strings for specific information types, but it does not specify that this property must always be present or non-null.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.room.description != null`, which implies that the `description` property of the `room` object must always have a value (i.e., it cannot be null).

### Analysis
The invariant assumes that every `room` object within the `offers` array will have a `description` that is not null. However, the Swagger definition does not enforce this requirement. It only describes the structure of the response and does not guarantee that the `description` field will always be populated. It is possible for some `room` objects to have a `description` that is null or omitted entirely, especially if the data source does not provide this information for certain offers.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant `return.room.description != null` does not hold for every valid request on the API (as the `description` field may be null or absent), the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

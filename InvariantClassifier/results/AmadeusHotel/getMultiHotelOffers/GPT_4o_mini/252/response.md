### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a `200` status code. The response schema indicates that the response body is an object containing a property `data`, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `commission` object, which has an `amount` property of type string. The description specifies that this amount is linked to the currency code of the offer.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.commission.amount` can only be one of the values: { "1.78", "2.74" }. This suggests that the only possible values for the `amount` field in the `commission` object are these two specific strings.

### Analysis
The invariant is overly restrictive. While the Swagger definition specifies that the `amount` is a string, it does not limit the possible values to just "1.78" or "2.74". The description does not provide any constraints that would imply these are the only valid values. In practice, the `amount` could represent any valid string that corresponds to a commission amount, which could include many other values beyond just these two. Therefore, the invariant does not hold true for every valid response from this API endpoint.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant restricts the `amount` to only two specific values without any supporting constraints in the Swagger definition, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The actual API can return a wider range of values for `return.commission.amount` than just "1.78" or "2.74".

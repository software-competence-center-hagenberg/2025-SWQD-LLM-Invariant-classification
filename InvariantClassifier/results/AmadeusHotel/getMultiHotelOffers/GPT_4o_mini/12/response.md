### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing a `data` field, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `policies` object, which in turn has a `guarantee` object. The `guarantee` object contains a `description` field. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.description == return.policies.guarantee.description`, implying that the `description` field of the offer is equal to the `description` field of the guarantee policy. 

### Analysis
1. **Structure of Response**: The response structure indicates that each offer can have its own `description` and its own `policies` with a `guarantee` that also has a `description`. 
2. **Independence of Fields**: The `description` of an offer and the `description` of the guarantee policy are not inherently linked or required to be equal based on the provided schema. They can represent different information about the offer and the guarantee policy, respectively. 
3. **Possible Scenarios**: There could be scenarios where the `description` of an offer is a general description of the hotel offer, while the `guarantee.description` could provide specific details about the booking guarantee, which may not be the same. 

### Conclusion
Since the invariant assumes a relationship of equality between two independent fields that can vary independently, it does not hold true for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` which returns a response with a structure that includes a `data` object containing an array of `offers`. Each `offer` has a `rateFamilyEstimated` object, which contains a `code` property. The `code` property is defined as a string that must match a specific pattern: `[A-Z0-9]{3}`. This pattern indicates that the string must consist of exactly three characters, all of which can be uppercase letters (A-Z) or digits (0-9).

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `code` string in the `rateFamilyEstimated` object must always equal 3: `LENGTH(return.rateFamilyEstimated.code)==3`. This is a unary invariant that asserts a fixed length for the string.

### Analysis
Given the pattern defined in the Swagger specification, the `code` property is explicitly constrained to be exactly three characters long. The regex pattern `[A-Z0-9]{3}` enforces this requirement, meaning that any valid response from the API must adhere to this rule. Therefore, for every valid request to this endpoint, the `code` will always have a length of 3, as it cannot be any other length due to the constraints set forth in the Swagger definition.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant correctly reflects the constraints defined in the Swagger specification and holds true for every valid response from the API, it is classified as a **true-positive**.

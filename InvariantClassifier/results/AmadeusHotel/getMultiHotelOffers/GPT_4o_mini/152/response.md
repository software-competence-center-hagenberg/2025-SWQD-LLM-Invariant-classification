### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/shopping/hotel-offers` that accepts a query parameter `checkOutDate`. This parameter is a string representing the check-out date in the format YYYY-MM-DD, which defaults to `checkInDate + 1` if not provided. The response for a successful request (HTTP status 200) is an object containing a property `data`, which is an array of items. Each item in this array has a property `self`, which is also a string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.checkOutDate` is a substring of `return.self`. This means that the value of the `checkOutDate` parameter in the request should be found within the string value of `self` in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Parameters and Response**: The `checkOutDate` is a date string, while `self` is a string that could represent a URL or some identifier related to the hotel offer. There is no inherent relationship between the check-out date and the string in `self` based on the provided definition.
2. **Possible Values**: The `checkOutDate` could be any valid date string, while `self` could be any string that does not necessarily include the date. For example, if `self` is a URL like "http://example.com/hotel/12345", it is highly unlikely that the check-out date (e.g., "2023-10-15") would be a substring of that URL.
3. **Lack of Correlation**: The invariant suggests a correlation that does not exist based on the API's design. The check-out date is a parameter for filtering or determining the offers, but it does not dictate the content of the `self` string in the response.

### Conclusion
Given that there is no requirement or guarantee in the API specification that `checkOutDate` will be a substring of `self`, the invariant is incorrect. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at "/shopping/hotel-offers" that returns a response with a 200 status code. The response schema indicates that the data returned is an object containing a property `data`, which is an array of items. Each item in this array contains a `hotel` object, which has a property `cityCode`.

The `cityCode` property is defined as a string that must match a specific pattern: `^[A-Z]{3}$`. This pattern indicates that the `cityCode` must consist of exactly three uppercase letters, which aligns with the IATA city code format.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `cityCode` string must always be 3: `LENGTH(return.hotel.cityCode)==3`. This is a specific assertion about the length of the `cityCode` field in the response.

### Analysis
Given the pattern defined in the Swagger documentation, the `cityCode` is explicitly required to be three uppercase letters. Therefore, any valid response from this endpoint will always have a `cityCode` that is exactly 3 characters long. This means that the invariant `LENGTH(return.hotel.cityCode)==3` is indeed correct for every valid request to this API endpoint.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant holds true for all valid responses as per the Swagger definition, it can be classified as a true-positive.

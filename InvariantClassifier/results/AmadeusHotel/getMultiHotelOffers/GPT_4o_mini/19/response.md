### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a schema containing an array of offers. Each offer has a property `rateFamilyEstimated`, which is an object that includes a `type` property. The `type` property is defined as a string with a pattern that allows values 'P', 'N', or 'C'.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.rateFamilyEstimated.type` should be one of { "C", "P" }. This means that it restricts the possible values of `type` to only 'C' and 'P', excluding 'N'.

### Analysis
According to the Swagger definition, the `type` property can take on three distinct values: 'P', 'N', and 'C'. The invariant restricts the possible values to only 'C' and 'P'. Since 'N' is a valid value according to the Swagger definition, the invariant does not hold for every valid response. Therefore, there will be cases where the `rateFamilyEstimated.type` can be 'N', which contradicts the invariant.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it incorrectly restricts the possible values of `return.rateFamilyEstimated.type` to only 'C' and 'P', while the API allows for 'N' as well.

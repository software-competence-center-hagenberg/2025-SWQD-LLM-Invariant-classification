### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a GET request to the endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers`. The response schema indicates that the response will be an object containing a property `data`, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a property `checkInDate`, which is described as a string representing the check-in date of the stay in the format YYYY-MM-DD. The definition explicitly states that the lowest accepted value for `checkInDate` is today’s date, meaning no dates in the past are allowed.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.checkInDate` is a Date in the format YYYY/MM/DD. It also mentions that the separator can be either `/` or `-`. 

### Analysis
1. **Format Mismatch**: The invariant specifies the date format as YYYY/MM/DD, while the Swagger definition specifies it as YYYY-MM-DD. This is a critical discrepancy because it indicates that the invariant is expecting a different format than what is defined in the API.
2. **Date Validity**: The invariant does not consider the requirement that the date must not be in the past, which is a significant aspect of the API's behavior. The invariant only focuses on the format and does not address the validity of the date itself.
3. **Response Structure**: The invariant refers to `return.checkInDate`, which is indeed part of the response structure as defined in the Swagger. However, the format mismatch makes it invalid.

### Conclusion
Given the discrepancies in the expected date format and the lack of consideration for the date's validity, the invariant cannot be considered correct for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

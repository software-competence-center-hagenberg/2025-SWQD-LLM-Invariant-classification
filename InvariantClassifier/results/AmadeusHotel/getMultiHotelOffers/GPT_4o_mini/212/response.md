### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing an array of offers. Each offer has a `policies` object, which includes a `cancellation` object. Within the `cancellation` object, there is a `description` property that contains a `lang` field, which is a string that follows the RFC 5646 standard for language tags.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `lang` field within the `cancellation.description` should always equal "EN". This is expressed as:  
`return.policies.cancellation.description.lang == "EN"`

### Analysis
The `lang` field is defined as a string, but the Swagger definition does not impose any restrictions on what values this string can take. The description mentions that it can convey a list of strings for specific information types in specific character sets or languages. This implies that the `lang` field can potentially hold various language codes, not just "EN". 

Since the API does not guarantee that the `lang` field will always be "EN" and can accept other language codes (like "fr-FR" for French, or any other valid language code), the invariant cannot be considered universally true for every valid request. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes a specific value for a field that is not restricted by the API definition, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. It does not hold for every valid request on the API, as the `lang` field can take on multiple distinct values beyond just "EN".

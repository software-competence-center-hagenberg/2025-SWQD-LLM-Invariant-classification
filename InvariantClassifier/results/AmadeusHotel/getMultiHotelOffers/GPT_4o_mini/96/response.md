### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a status code of 200. The response schema indicates that the response body is an object containing a property `data`, which is an array of items. Each item in this array is expected to be an object with a property `type` that is a string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.type` should equal "hotel-offers". This implies that every item in the `data` array must have a `type` property that strictly equals "hotel-offers".

### Analysis
While the Swagger definition indicates that the `type` of the object in the `data` array is a string, it does not explicitly restrict the values of this string to only "hotel-offers". The definition only describes the structure of the response but does not enforce that the `type` must be a specific value. Therefore, it is possible for the `type` to be any string, not just "hotel-offers". 

### Conclusion
Since the invariant assumes that the `type` will always be "hotel-offers" without any restrictions in the Swagger definition to support this claim, the invariant is incorrect. Thus, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

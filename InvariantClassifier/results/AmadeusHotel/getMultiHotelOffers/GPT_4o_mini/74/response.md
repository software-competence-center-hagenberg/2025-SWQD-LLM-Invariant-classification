### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines the structure of the response for the `getMultiHotelOffers` endpoint. The response contains a `data` object, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` has a `price` object that includes a `variations` object, which in turn contains an `average` object with a `total` string. Additionally, each `offer` has a `policies` object that includes a `deposit` object, which contains an `acceptedPayments` object that lists various payment methods in an array.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.price.variations.average.total` is always a member of `return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]`. This means that the `total` string from the `price.variations.average` object must always be found within the array of accepted payment methods.

### Analysis
1. **Structure of Response**: The response structure indicates that `total` is a string representing a price valuation, while `acceptedPayments.methods` is an array of strings representing various payment methods. 
2. **Nature of Values**: The `total` value is a financial amount (e.g., "100.00"), while the `methods` array contains specific payment method identifiers (e.g., "CREDIT_CARD", "CHECK"). 
3. **Logical Consistency**: There is no logical basis for a price value (like `total`) to be a member of a list of payment method identifiers. Payment methods and price values are fundamentally different types of data and serve different purposes in the context of the API response.
4. **Potential for False-Positive**: Given that the `total` string represents a monetary value and the `methods` array contains payment method identifiers, it is highly unlikely that a monetary value would ever match any of the payment method strings. Therefore, the invariant cannot hold true for all valid responses.

### Conclusion
The invariant stating that `return.price.variations.average.total` is always a member of `return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]` is incorrect. The invariant is classified as a **false-positive** because the nature of the values in question does not allow for the invariant to hold true in all cases.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a REST API endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a list of hotel offers. Each offer includes a `policies` object, which contains a `guarantee` object. Within the `guarantee` object, there is an `acceptedPayments` object that lists various payment methods available for booking.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the array `return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]` must equal 1. This implies that for every valid response from the API, there should only be one accepted payment method available in the `methods` array.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that the `acceptedPayments.methods` array can only contain a single method. However, the Swagger definition indicates that multiple payment methods can be available, as it lists several options (e.g., CREDIT_CARD, AGENCY_ACCOUNT, etc.). Therefore, it is entirely possible for the `methods` array to contain multiple entries, contradicting the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given that the API response can include multiple accepted payment methods, the invariant stating that the size of `acceptedPayments.methods[]` must equal 1 is incorrect. Thus, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

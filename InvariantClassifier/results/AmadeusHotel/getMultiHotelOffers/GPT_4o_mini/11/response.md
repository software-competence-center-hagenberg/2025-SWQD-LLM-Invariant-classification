### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` which returns a response with a structure containing a `data` field that is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `description` and a `commission`, where `commission` also has a `description`. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.description == return.commission.description`, indicating that the `description` field of an offer should be equal to the `description` field of its `commission`. 

### Analysis
1. **Structure of Response**: The response structure allows for each `offer` to have its own `description` and a `commission` which also has a `description`. 
2. **Independence of Fields**: There is no indication in the Swagger definition that the `description` of an offer and the `description` of its `commission` are related or should be equal. They are independent fields, and their values can vary based on the data provided by the API. 
3. **Potential for Different Values**: Since the `description` fields are not constrained to be equal by the API definition, it is entirely possible for an offer's `description` to differ from its `commission`'s `description`. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant suggests a strict equality between two independent fields without any supporting evidence from the API definition, this invariant is incorrect. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

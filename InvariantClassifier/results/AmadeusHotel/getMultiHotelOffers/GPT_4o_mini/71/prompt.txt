Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.room.typeEstimated.beds < size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards[])-1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntLessThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of < between two long scalars. Prints as x < y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

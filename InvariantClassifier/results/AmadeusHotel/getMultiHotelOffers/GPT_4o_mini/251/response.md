### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that returns hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the `cancellation.description.lang` property is a string that is expected to conform to the language tag format specified by RFC 5646. This format allows for language codes that can vary in length, such as 'en', 'fr', 'es', or more complex tags like 'fr-FR' or 'en-US'.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the string `return.policies.cancellation.description.lang` is always equal to 2. This implies that the only valid values for this field would be two-letter language codes, which are typically ISO 639-1 codes.

### Analysis
However, according to the RFC 5646 specification, language tags can be longer than 2 characters. For example, 'fr-FR' (French as spoken in France) is a valid language tag that has a length of 5. Therefore, the invariant that the length of `lang` is always 2 does not hold true for all possible valid responses from this API. The API could return language tags that are longer than 2 characters, thus violating the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant does not account for the full range of valid language tags as defined by RFC 5646, it cannot be considered correct for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

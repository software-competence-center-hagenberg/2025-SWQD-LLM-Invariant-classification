### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `data`, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `price` object, which has a `total` property defined as a string. The description states that this `total` is the sum of `base` and `totalTaxes`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.price.total` is Numeric, which means that the `total` field in the response is expected to always contain a numeric value represented as a string.

### Analysis
The invariant claims that the `total` field is always numeric. However, the Swagger definition specifies that `total` is of type `string`. While it is common for numeric values to be represented as strings in APIs, there is no guarantee that the string will always represent a valid numeric value. For example, the `total` could potentially contain non-numeric characters (like currency symbols, commas, or other formatting characters) or could be an empty string. Therefore, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold true for every valid response from this API.

### Conclusion
Given that the `total` field is defined as a string and there is no explicit constraint ensuring that it will always be numeric, the invariant is not correct for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a false-positive.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing an array of offers. Each offer includes a price object, which in turn contains a variations object. The variations object has an average property that includes a total field, which is a string representing the total price.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the field `return.price.variations.average.total` should equal the string "126.73".

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The response structure allows for various offers, and each offer's price can vary based on different factors such as location, time of booking, and availability. Therefore, the total price can change depending on these factors.
2. **Dynamic Pricing**: The total price is likely to be dynamic and can vary for different requests or under different conditions. It is not guaranteed that the total will always be "126.73" for every valid request.
3. **Invariant Validity**: Since the invariant asserts that the total price must equal a specific value, it does not hold true universally across all valid requests. There could be scenarios where the total price is different due to the reasons mentioned above.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant requires a specific value for a field that is subject to change based on various factors, it cannot be considered universally valid. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

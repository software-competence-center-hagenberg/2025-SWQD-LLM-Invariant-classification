### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `data`, which is an array of offers. Each offer contains a `price` object, which in turn contains a `taxes` array. Each item in the `taxes` array is expected to have a `pricingFrequency` property that specifies how the tax applies.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `pricingFrequency` must be one of the two specified values: "PER_NIGHT" or "PER_STAY". This is a common pattern for fields that have a limited set of acceptable values.

### Analysis
The invariant is based on the description provided in the Swagger definition, which explicitly states that the `pricingFrequency` can take on the values "PER_STAY" or "PER_NIGHT". Since the schema defines these as the only possible values for the `pricingFrequency` property, the invariant holds true for every valid response from the API. There are no other values mentioned or implied in the schema that would contradict this invariant.

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition clearly specifies the allowed values for `pricingFrequency`, the invariant is correct and holds for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing a `data` property, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `policies` object, which in turn has a `checkInOut` object. The `checkInOut` object has a property `checkOutDescription`, which is described as an object that conveys a list of strings for specific information types.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.policies.checkInOut.checkOutDescription == null`. This means that the `checkOutDescription` property should always be null in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: According to the Swagger definition, `checkOutDescription` is part of the `checkInOut` object within `policies`. The description indicates that it is meant to convey specific information, which implies that it is likely to hold meaningful data rather than being null.
2. **Potential Values**: The invariant suggests that `checkOutDescription` will always be null, which contradicts the purpose of the property as described in the Swagger definition. If the property is designed to convey information, it is reasonable to expect that it could contain values other than null.
3. **Use Cases**: In practice, there may be scenarios where `checkOutDescription` is populated with relevant information about check-out rules or descriptions, especially in a hotel booking context.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant asserts that `checkOutDescription` will always be null, while the Swagger definition suggests it is intended to provide information, this invariant does not hold true for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

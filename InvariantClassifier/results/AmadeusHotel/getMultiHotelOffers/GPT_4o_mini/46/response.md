### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided excerpt from the Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `data`, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `policies` object, which in turn contains a `cancellation` object. The `cancellation` object has a property `numberOfNights`, which is defined as an integer.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `numberOfNights` field in the response will only take on the values 1 or 3. This is expressed as:  
`return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights one of { 1, 3 }`.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that the `numberOfNights` can only be 1 or 3. However, the Swagger definition does not impose any restrictions on the possible values of `numberOfNights`. It is simply defined as an integer, which means it can take on any integer value. There are no constraints or enumerations provided in the schema that limit `numberOfNights` to just 1 or 3. Therefore, it is entirely possible for the API to return other integer values for `numberOfNights`, such as 0, 2, 4, or any other integer.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant is based on an assumption that is not supported by the Swagger definition, it is incorrect. The `numberOfNights` can take on a wide range of integer values, making the invariant a false-positive.

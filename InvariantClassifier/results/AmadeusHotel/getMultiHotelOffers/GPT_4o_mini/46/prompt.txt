Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    policies:
                      type: object
                      description: Booking Rules
                      properties:
                        cancellation:
                          type: object
                          properties:
                            numberOfNights:
                              type: integer
                              description: Number of nights due as fee in case of cancellation.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights one of { 1, 3 }

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.OneOfScalar
Invariant description: Represents long variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

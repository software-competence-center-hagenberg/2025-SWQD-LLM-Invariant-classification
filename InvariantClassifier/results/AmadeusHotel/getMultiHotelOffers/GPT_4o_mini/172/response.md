### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint for retrieving hotel offers based on a specified number of rooms. The relevant parts of the definition include:
- **Endpoint**: `/shopping/hotel-offers`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Parameter**: `roomQuantity` (integer, minimum 1, maximum 9)
- **Response**: Contains a `data` object with an array of `offers`, each having a `policies` object that includes a `guarantee` object with `acceptedPayments`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the array `return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]` minus one is divisible by the input parameter `roomQuantity`, expressed as:

`size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]) - 1 % input.roomQuantity == 0`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the number of accepted payment methods (minus one) should be a multiple of the number of rooms requested. This implies a relationship between the number of payment methods and the room quantity.
2. **Possible Values**: The `roomQuantity` can range from 1 to 9. The `acceptedPayments.methods` array can have various lengths depending on the hotel offers and their policies. For example, if there are 3 accepted payment methods, the invariant would require that `3 - 1 = 2` is divisible by `roomQuantity`. This would hold true for `roomQuantity` values of 1 or 2 but not for others.
3. **Counterexamples**: If `roomQuantity` is 3 and there are 4 accepted payment methods, the invariant would yield `4 - 1 = 3`, which is not divisible by 3. Similarly, if there are 5 accepted payment methods and `roomQuantity` is 2, then `5 - 1 = 4`, which is not divisible by 2. Thus, there are scenarios where the invariant does not hold.

### Conclusion
The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, as there are combinations of `roomQuantity` and the size of `acceptedPayments.methods` that will violate the invariant. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

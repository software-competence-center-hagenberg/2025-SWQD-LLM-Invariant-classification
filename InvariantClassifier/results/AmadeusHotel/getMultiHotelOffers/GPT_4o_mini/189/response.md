### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that requires a mandatory query parameter `hotelIds`, which is an array of Amadeus property codes. The response schema indicates that it returns an object containing a `data` array, which includes `offers`. Each offer contains a `policies` object, which in turn contains a `deposit` object. The `deposit` object has an `acceptedPayments` object that lists various payment methods.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the input array `hotelIds` minus one is divisible by the size of the `acceptedPayments.methods` array, i.e., `size(input.hotelIds[]) - 1 % size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0`. This suggests a relationship between the number of hotel IDs provided in the request and the number of accepted payment methods returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Input Parameter**: The `hotelIds` parameter is mandatory and can contain multiple values. The size of this array can vary based on the user's input.
2. **Response Structure**: The response structure indicates that `acceptedPayments.methods` can contain a list of payment methods, which may or may not be influenced by the number of hotel IDs provided in the request.
3. **Divisibility Condition**: The invariant implies that there is a consistent relationship between the number of hotel IDs and the number of accepted payment methods. However, there is no indication in the Swagger definition that the number of accepted payment methods is dependent on the number of hotel IDs. The accepted payment methods are likely fixed and do not change based on the input.
4. **Counterexample**: If a request is made with 3 hotel IDs, and the response returns 5 accepted payment methods, the invariant would not hold since `(3 - 1) % 5 != 0`. This indicates that the invariant does not hold for all valid requests.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because there is no inherent relationship established in the API specification that guarantees the divisibility condition between the number of hotel IDs and the number of accepted payment methods. The accepted payment methods are likely static and not influenced by the input parameters.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that returns hotel offers, including various payment policies. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that each offer can have a `deposit` object, which contains an `acceptedPayments` object. This object has two properties: `creditCards` (an array of accepted credit card types) and `methods` (an array of accepted payment methods).

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `creditCards` array minus one is greater than the size of the `methods` array: 

`size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]) - 1 > size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[])`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that for every response, the number of accepted credit card types (minus one) should always be greater than the number of accepted payment methods. This implies that there should be at least two credit card types for every payment method accepted.
2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If there are 2 credit card types and 1 payment method, the invariant holds: `2 - 1 > 1` (True).
   - If there is 1 credit card type and 1 payment method, the invariant does not hold: `1 - 1 > 1` (False).
   - If there are 0 credit card types and 0 payment methods, the invariant does not hold: `0 - 1 > 0` (False).
   - If there are 1 credit card type and 0 payment methods, the invariant does not hold: `1 - 1 > 0` (False).
   - If there are 2 credit card types and 0 payment methods, the invariant holds: `2 - 1 > 0` (True).

From this analysis, it is clear that there are valid responses where the invariant does not hold, particularly when the number of credit card types is less than or equal to one, or when there are no credit card types at all.

### Conclusion
Given that there are scenarios where the invariant does not hold true for valid API responses, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. It does not hold for every valid request on the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a 200 status code. The response schema indicates that the data is an array of hotel objects, each containing a property called `type`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `type` property of the `hotel` object in the response should always equal the string "hotel". This is expressed as `return.hotel.type == "hotel"`.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The Swagger definition indicates that the `type` property is a string, but it does not specify the allowed values for this property. 
2. **Lack of Constraints**: Since the definition does not enforce that the `type` must always be "hotel", it is possible for the `type` to take on other values (e.g., "motel", "resort", etc.). 
3. **Generalization**: The invariant assumes that all hotel objects returned will have the `type` set to "hotel", which is not guaranteed by the Swagger definition. 

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition does not restrict the `type` property to only the value "hotel", the invariant cannot be considered correct for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

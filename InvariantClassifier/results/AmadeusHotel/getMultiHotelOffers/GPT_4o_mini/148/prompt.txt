    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:

                  type: object
                  description: Hotel Content
                  properties:
                    dupeId:
                      type: string
                      description: Unique Property identifier of the physical hotel.
                      One physical hotel can be represented by different Providers, each one having its own `hotelID`.
                      This attribute allows a client application to group together hotels that are actually the same.
                      example: 501132260

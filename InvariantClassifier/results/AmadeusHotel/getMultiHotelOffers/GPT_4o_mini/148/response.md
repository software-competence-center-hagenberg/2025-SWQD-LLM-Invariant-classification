### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `data`, which is an array of hotel objects. Each hotel object has a property `dupeId`, which is defined as a string. The description clarifies that `dupeId` is a unique identifier for a hotel, but it does not specify that it is numeric. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.hotel.dupeId` is Numeric, which implies that the value of `dupeId` should consist only of numeric characters. 

### Analysis
1. **Type Definition**: The Swagger definition explicitly states that `dupeId` is of type `string`. This means that while it can contain numeric characters, it can also contain non-numeric characters (e.g., letters, special characters). 
2. **Example Value**: The example provided (`501132260`) is indeed numeric, but this does not guarantee that all possible values of `dupeId` will be numeric. The definition does not restrict the format of `dupeId` to only numeric values.
3. **Potential Values**: Since `dupeId` is a string, it can potentially hold any string value, including non-numeric characters. Therefore, the invariant that `dupeId` is always numeric cannot be guaranteed.

### Conclusion
Given that the definition allows `dupeId` to be a string without enforcing it to be numeric, the invariant that `return.hotel.dupeId is Numeric` is incorrect. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

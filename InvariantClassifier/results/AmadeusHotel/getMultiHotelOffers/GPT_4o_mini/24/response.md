### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a GET request to the `/shopping/hotel-offers` endpoint, which returns a response with a structure that includes a `data` property containing an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `room` object, which in turn has a `typeEstimated` property. This property is described as an object that provides information about the room category, bed type, and number of beds, but it is explicitly stated that this information is for informational purposes only.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.room.typeEstimated != null`, meaning that the `typeEstimated` property of the `room` object must not be null in the response.

### Analysis
Given the description in the Swagger definition, the `typeEstimated` property is derived from the room description and is provided for informational purposes. This implies that there may be scenarios where the room description does not contain sufficient information to estimate the room type, leading to the possibility that `typeEstimated` could be null. Therefore, it cannot be guaranteed that `typeEstimated` will always have a value; it may be null in some cases, especially if the room description is incomplete or ambiguous.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant `return.room.typeEstimated != null` does not hold for every valid request on the API (as there may be valid responses where `typeEstimated` is indeed null), the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

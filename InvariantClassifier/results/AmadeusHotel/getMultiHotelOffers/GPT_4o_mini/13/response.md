### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing a `data` field, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `policies` object that has a `deposit` object, which in turn contains a `description` object. The invariant in question states that the `description` of the return object is equal to the `description` of the `deposit` policy within the `policies` object of the same offer.

### Invariant
The invariant states: `return.description == return.policies.deposit.description`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Structure**: The response structure indicates that each `offer` has a `policies` object, which contains a `deposit` object with its own `description`. The invariant suggests that the `description` of the offer itself is equal to the `description` of the deposit policy.
2. **Potential Variability**: There is no indication in the Swagger definition that the `description` of the offer and the `description` of the deposit policy are inherently linked or should be equal. They could represent different pieces of information. For example, the offer's description might provide a general overview of the hotel offer, while the deposit description might detail specific payment policies.
3. **Lack of Constraints**: The invariant does not account for the possibility that these two descriptions could be entirely different, as they serve different purposes in the context of the API response.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes a relationship between two fields that are not defined as being equal in the API specification, it is incorrect to assert that `return.description` will always equal `return.policies.deposit.description`. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

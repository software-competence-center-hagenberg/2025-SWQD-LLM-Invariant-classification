### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided excerpt from the Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a `200` status code. The response schema indicates that the `data` field is an array of hotel objects, each containing a `dupeId` property. The `dupeId` is described as a string that serves as a unique identifier for a physical hotel, and it is noted that this identifier can vary in length depending on the provider.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `dupeId` string must always equal 9: `LENGTH(return.hotel.dupeId)==9`. This is classified as a fixed-length string invariant.

### Analysis
The description of the `dupeId` does not specify that it must always be exactly 9 characters long. It only states that it is a unique identifier that can vary based on the provider. Since different providers may use different formats for their identifiers, it is entirely possible that the `dupeId` could be shorter or longer than 9 characters. Therefore, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid response from the API.

### Conclusion
Given that the `dupeId` can vary in length and is not restricted to being exactly 9 characters, the invariant `LENGTH(return.hotel.dupeId)==9` is a **false-positive**. It does not hold for every valid request on the API.

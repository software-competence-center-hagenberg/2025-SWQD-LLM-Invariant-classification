Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                hotel:
                  type: object
                  description: Hotel Content
                  properties:
                    dupeId:
                      type: string
                      description: Unique Property identifier of the physical hotel.
                      One physical hotel can be represented by different Providers, each one having its own `hotelID`.
                      This attribute allows a client application to group together hotels that are actually the same.
                      example: 501132260

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the `data` property is an array of `offers`, and each `offer` contains a `commission` object. Within the `commission` object, there is an `amount` property defined as a string. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.commission.amount` is Numeric, which implies that the string value of `amount` should only contain numeric characters. 

### Analysis
According to the Swagger definition, the `amount` is specified as a string. This means that while it can represent numeric values, it is not restricted to only numeric characters. For example, the `amount` could potentially include characters such as currency symbols (e.g., "$100"), commas (e.g., "1,000"), or decimal points (e.g., "100.50"). Therefore, the invariant that `return.commission.amount` is Numeric does not hold true for all valid responses, as the string can contain non-numeric characters. 

### Conclusion
Since the `amount` is defined as a string and can include non-numeric characters, the invariant is not correct for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

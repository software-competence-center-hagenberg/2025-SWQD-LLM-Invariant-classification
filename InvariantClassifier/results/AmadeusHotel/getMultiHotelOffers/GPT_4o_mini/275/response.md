### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `data`, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a property `policies`, which is an object that includes a `deposit` property. The `deposit` property is itself an object that contains an `amount` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.policies.deposit.amount` is Numeric, meaning that the `amount` field is expected to always contain a numeric value.

### Analysis
1. **Type of `amount`:** The Swagger definition specifies that the `amount` property is of type `string`. This means that it can contain any characters that are valid in a string, including non-numeric characters. Therefore, it does not guarantee that the `amount` will always be numeric.
2. **Potential Values:** Since `amount` is a string, it could potentially hold values like "100", "100.50", or even "abc" or "100abc", which are not numeric. The invariant assumes that the `amount` will always be numeric, which is not supported by the definition.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because the Swagger definition allows for the `amount` to be a string, which does not guarantee that it will always be numeric. Therefore, the invariant that states `return.policies.deposit.amount is Numeric` does not hold for every valid request on the API.

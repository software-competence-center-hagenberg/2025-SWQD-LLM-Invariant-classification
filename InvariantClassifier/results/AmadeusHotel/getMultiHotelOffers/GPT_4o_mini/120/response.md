### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a GET endpoint at "/shopping/hotel-offers" that returns a response with a structure containing a `data` field, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `roomQuantity` field, which is defined as a string that represents the number of rooms and can take values from 1 to 9. The example provided indicates that the `roomQuantity` can be '1'. 

### Invariant
The invariant in question is: `LENGTH(return.roomQuantity)==1`. This suggests that the length of the `roomQuantity` string in the response will always be exactly 1 character long. 

### Analysis
Given that `roomQuantity` is defined as a string representing the number of rooms (1-9), valid values for `roomQuantity` could be '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', or '9'. Each of these values is indeed a single character string, which means that the length of `roomQuantity` will always be 1 for any valid response. Therefore, the invariant `LENGTH(return.roomQuantity)==1` holds true for all valid responses from this endpoint. 

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the Swagger definition and the nature of the `roomQuantity` field, the invariant is correct and holds for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that returns hotel offers, specifically detailing the accepted payment methods for booking. The response schema indicates that the `acceptedPayments` field contains an array of payment methods, which can include various options such as CREDIT_CARD, AGENCY_ACCOUNT, and others.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `acceptedPayments.methods[]` will only return the value `[CREDIT_CARD]`. This implies that the only accepted payment method for any hotel offer is a credit card.

### Analysis
Given the schema, the `methods` array can contain multiple values, not just `CREDIT_CARD`. The description explicitly lists several accepted payment methods, indicating that the API can return offers that accept various forms of payment. Therefore, the invariant that `acceptedPayments.methods[]` is strictly equal to `[CREDIT_CARD]` is incorrect, as the API can return offers that accept other payment methods as well.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it incorrectly assumes that the only accepted payment method is a credit card, while the API is designed to support multiple payment methods as indicated in the Swagger definition.

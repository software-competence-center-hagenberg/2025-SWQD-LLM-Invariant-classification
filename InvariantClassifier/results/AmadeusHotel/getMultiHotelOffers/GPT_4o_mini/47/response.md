### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a REST API endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `data`, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `policies` object, which in turn has a `cancellation` object. The `cancellation` object has a `description` property that is itself an object containing a `text` property, which is a string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.policies.cancellation.description.text` can only take on one of the specified values: "NON-REFUNDABLE RATE" or "Plus Taxes and fees where appropriate." This implies that the `text` field is restricted to these two specific strings.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that the `text` field has a limited set of acceptable values. However, the Swagger definition does not impose any restrictions on the values that the `text` field can take. It is described as a string, which means it can potentially hold any string value, not just the two specified in the invariant. Therefore, while the invariant may hold true for some responses, it is not guaranteed to hold for every valid response from the API.

### Conclusion
Since the Swagger definition does not restrict the `text` field to only the specified values, the invariant is not correct for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

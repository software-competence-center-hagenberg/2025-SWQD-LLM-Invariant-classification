### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a `200` status code. The response schema indicates that it contains an object with a `data` property, which is an array of `offers`. Each offer is expected to have a `checkInDate` property, which is a string formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`. The description specifies that the lowest accepted value for `checkInDate` is today’s date, meaning that no past dates are allowed.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `checkInDate` can only be one of the following values: "2022-09-20", "2022-09-21", "2022-09-22".

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that the `checkInDate` is restricted to a specific set of values. However, the Swagger definition indicates that the `checkInDate` must be today or a future date, which means that the valid values for `checkInDate` are not limited to just the three specified dates. For example, if today’s date is "2022-09-19", then valid `checkInDate` values could include "2022-09-20", "2022-09-21", "2022-09-22", and any date beyond that. Therefore, the invariant does not hold true for every valid request, as there are many possible valid dates that are not included in the specified set.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it incorrectly restricts the `checkInDate` to only three specific values, while the actual valid values can include any date from today onwards, making the invariant not universally applicable to all valid responses.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that returns hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the `acceptedPayments` property contains an array of `creditCards`, where each credit card type is represented as a string. The relevant part of the schema is as follows:

- `acceptedPayments`: an object containing `creditCards`, which is an array of strings.
- Each string in `creditCards` has constraints: `minLength: 2`, `maxLength: 2`, and a pattern that enforces the strings to be exactly two uppercase letters (e.g., 'AM', 'VI').

### Invariant
The invariant states that all elements of `return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]` have LENGTH=2. This means that every string in the `creditCards` array must be exactly 2 characters long.

### Analysis
The schema explicitly defines the `creditCards` array with a `minLength` and `maxLength` of 2, which means that every string in this array must indeed be exactly 2 characters long. Therefore, the invariant holds true for every valid response from this API endpoint, as the constraints in the Swagger definition enforce this requirement.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant is supported by the schema defined in the Swagger documentation, it is classified as a true-positive. The invariant correctly reflects the constraints placed on the `creditCards` array in the API response.

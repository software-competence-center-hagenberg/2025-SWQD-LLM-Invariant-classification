### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The endpoint requires a query parameter `adults`, which specifies the number of adult guests (1-9) per room. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `data` object containing an array of `offers`, each of which has a `policies` object. Within `policies`, there is a `deposit` object that includes an `acceptedPayments` object, which in turn contains an array of `methods` representing accepted payment methods.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the number of adults (input.adults) must divide evenly into the size of the array of accepted payment methods (return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]). This is expressed mathematically as:

`input.adults % size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the number of adults should be a divisor of the number of accepted payment methods. This implies that for every valid request, the number of adults must be such that it can evenly divide the number of payment methods available.

2. **Possible Values**: The `adults` parameter is constrained to be between 1 and 9. However, the number of accepted payment methods is not defined in the Swagger excerpt. It could vary based on the hotel offers available at the time of the request.

3. **Counterexamples**: If there are, for example, 3 accepted payment methods and the user specifies 2 adults, the invariant would not hold because `2 % 3 != 0`. Similarly, if there are 5 accepted payment methods and the user specifies 4 adults, the invariant would again fail. Since the number of accepted payment methods can change dynamically and is not guaranteed to be a multiple of the number of adults, this invariant cannot be universally true.

### Conclusion
The invariant is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request to the API because the relationship between the number of adults and the number of accepted payment methods is not fixed. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing an array of offers. Each offer has a `category` and a `room` object, which contains a `description` object with a `text` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.category` is a substring of `return.room.description.text`. This means that for every offer returned, the `category` string must be found within the `text` string of the room's description.

### Analysis
1. **Structure of Response**: The response structure indicates that each offer has a `category` and a `room` with a `description` containing `text`. 
2. **Nature of Data**: The `category` is a string that represents a special rate category (e.g., `ASSOCIATION`, `FAMILY_PLAN`). The `text` in the `description` is free text that can vary widely and is not constrained to include the `category` string.
3. **Possibility of Invariant Holding**: There is no inherent relationship between the `category` and the `text` in the `description`. For instance, a `category` of `FAMILY_PLAN` does not guarantee that the `text` will contain the substring `FAMILY_PLAN`. The `text` could be completely unrelated, such as "This room is spacious and well-lit."
4. **Examples**: If an offer has a category of `FAMILY_PLAN`, the description text could be anything, and there is no requirement for it to include the category as a substring. Thus, the invariant does not hold universally.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant suggests a relationship that does not exist based on the provided API specification, it is classified as a false-positive. The `category` being a substring of `room.description.text` is not guaranteed for every valid response from the API.

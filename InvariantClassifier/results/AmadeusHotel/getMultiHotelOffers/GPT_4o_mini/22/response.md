### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a `200` status code. The response schema indicates that the `data` property is an array of `offers`, where each offer contains a `boardType` property. The `boardType` property is defined as a string with a specific set of enumerated values, including but not limited to: `ROOM_ONLY`, `BREAKFAST`, `HALF_BOARD`, `FULL_BOARD`, etc.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.boardType` can only be one of two values: `"BREAKFAST"` or `"ROOM_ONLY"`. 

### Analysis
The invariant is too restrictive given the definition of `boardType`. The `boardType` can take on a variety of values as defined in the Swagger specification. While `BREAKFAST` and `ROOM_ONLY` are valid values, there are many other valid options that `boardType` can assume (e.g., `HALF_BOARD`, `FULL_BOARD`, etc.). Therefore, the invariant does not hold for all valid responses from the API, as there are valid cases where `boardType` could be one of the other enumerated values.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not account for all possible values of `boardType` as defined in the Swagger specification, it is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant incorrectly limits the possible values of `boardType` to only two options when there are actually many valid options.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing an array of offers. Each offer includes a `rateFamilyEstimated` object, which has a `type` property that is a string. The `type` property is described to have a pattern of `[PNC]`, indicating that it can only be one of the characters 'P', 'N', or 'C'. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the string `return.rateFamilyEstimated.type` is always equal to 1, which means that the `type` property must always be a single character string. 

### Analysis
Given the description in the Swagger definition, the `type` property can only be one of the characters 'P', 'N', or 'C'. This implies that the `type` will always be a single character string. Therefore, the invariant that the length of `return.rateFamilyEstimated.type` is always equal to 1 is consistent with the definition provided in the Swagger documentation. There are no conditions or exceptions mentioned that would allow for a different length. 

### Conclusion
Since the invariant holds true for every valid response from the API as per the Swagger definition, it is classified as a true-positive.

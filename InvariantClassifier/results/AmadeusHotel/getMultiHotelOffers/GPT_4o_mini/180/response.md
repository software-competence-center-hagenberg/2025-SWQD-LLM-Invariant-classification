### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers based on a list of hotel IDs. The `hotelIds` parameter is mandatory and is expected to be an array of Amadeus property codes. The response schema indicates that the response will include an array of offers, each containing a `policies` object with a `cancellation` property that includes `numberOfNights`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `numberOfNights` in the cancellation policy of the response should not be equal to the size of the input `hotelIds` array. In other words, it asserts that the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation is not equal to the number of hotel IDs provided in the request.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Context**: The `numberOfNights` is a property that relates to the cancellation policy of a specific offer. The `hotelIds` parameter is a list of hotels for which offers are being requested.
2. **Potential Scenarios**: 
   - If the API returns offers for multiple hotels, it is possible that the `numberOfNights` could be the same as the number of hotel IDs, especially if the cancellation policy is uniform across offers.
   - Conversely, if the cancellation policy varies by hotel or if there are additional rules that apply, the `numberOfNights` could differ from the number of hotel IDs.
3. **Logical Conclusion**: The invariant asserts a strict inequality between `numberOfNights` and the size of `hotelIds`. However, there is no guarantee that this will always hold true, as the API could return offers where the cancellation policy results in `numberOfNights` being equal to the number of hotel IDs, especially if all hotels have the same cancellation policy.

### Conclusion
Given the variability in cancellation policies and the potential for the `numberOfNights` to equal the number of hotel IDs, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing an array of offers. Each offer includes a room object, which has a `typeEstimated` property. Within `typeEstimated`, there is a `beds` property that is defined as an integer, representing the number of beds in the room.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.room.typeEstimated.beds >= 1`, meaning that for every valid response from this endpoint, the number of beds in the room must be at least 1.

### Analysis
The description of the `beds` property indicates that it represents the number of beds in the room and is an integer. However, the description does not explicitly state that the number of beds must always be greater than or equal to 1. It only mentions that the information is parsed from the room description and is for informational purposes. Therefore, it is possible that the `beds` value could be 0 or even negative if the data source allows for such values, especially since it is derived from a description and not strictly validated.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes a lower bound of 1 for the `beds` property without explicit confirmation in the Swagger definition that this is always the case, the invariant is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

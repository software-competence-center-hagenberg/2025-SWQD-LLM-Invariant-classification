### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing a `data` field, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `price` object, which has a `base` property that is defined as a string. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.price.base` is Numeric, which implies that the `base` property of the `price` object in the response should always contain a numeric string (i.e., a string representation of a number).

### Analysis
However, the Swagger definition explicitly states that `base` is of type `string` without any constraints or validations indicating that it must be numeric. This means that while `base` can contain numeric values, it can also contain non-numeric characters (e.g., letters, symbols, or even empty strings). Therefore, the invariant that `return.price.base` is Numeric does not hold true for every valid response from this API endpoint, as there are no restrictions in the definition that enforce this condition.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, it is classified as a false-positive.

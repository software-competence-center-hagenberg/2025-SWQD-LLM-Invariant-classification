### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers`, which returns a response with a status code of 200. The response schema indicates that the `data` field contains an array of `offers`, and each `offer` contains a `roomQuantity` field. The `roomQuantity` field is defined as a string that represents the number of rooms, with a description stating it can range from 1 to 9.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.roomQuantity` is Numeric, which is defined as a string variable that always contains numeric characters.

### Analysis
1. **Type of `roomQuantity`:** According to the Swagger definition, `roomQuantity` is defined as a string. While it is expected to represent numeric values (1-9), it is still a string type. Therefore, it can contain non-numeric characters (e.g., "1", "2", "3", etc.) but could also potentially include invalid values (e.g., "one", "ten", etc.) if not properly validated.
2. **Invariant Evaluation:** The invariant claims that `return.roomQuantity` is always numeric. However, since `roomQuantity` is a string, it is possible for it to contain non-numeric characters, which would violate the invariant. The invariant does not account for the possibility of invalid string values being returned.

### Conclusion
Given that `roomQuantity` is defined as a string and can potentially contain non-numeric characters, the invariant that `return.roomQuantity` is Numeric does not hold true for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a false-positive.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `data`, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` contains a `policies` object, which in turn has a `deposit` object. The `deposit` object includes an `acceptedPayments` property, which is an object containing a `methods` array. This array lists various accepted payment methods, including `CREDIT_CARD` and `ADVANCE_DEPOSIT` among others.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `methods` array can only contain one of the following combinations: `[CREDIT_CARD]` or `[CREDIT_CARD, ADVANCE_DEPOSIT]`. This implies that the only valid configurations for the `methods` array are either just `CREDIT_CARD` or both `CREDIT_CARD` and `ADVANCE_DEPOSIT`.

### Analysis
The invariant is too restrictive given the information in the Swagger definition. The `methods` array can include multiple payment methods, and the Swagger definition lists several other accepted payment methods beyond just `CREDIT_CARD` and `ADVANCE_DEPOSIT`. For example, the methods array could also include `AGENCY_ACCOUNT`, `TRAVEL_AGENT_ID`, `CORPORATE_ID`, `HOTEL_GUEST_ID`, `CHECK`, `MISC_CHARGE_ORDER`, and potentially others. Therefore, the invariant does not account for the full range of valid values that the `methods` array can take.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant incorrectly limits the possible values of the `methods` array to only two specific configurations, it does not hold for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

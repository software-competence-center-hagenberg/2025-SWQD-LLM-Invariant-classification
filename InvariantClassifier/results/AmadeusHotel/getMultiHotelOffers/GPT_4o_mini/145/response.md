### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a `200` status code. The response schema indicates that the `data` property is an array of objects, each containing a `hotel` object. Within the `hotel` object, there is a property `hotelId` which is defined as a string that must match a specific pattern: `^[A-Z0-9]{8}$`. This pattern enforces that the `hotelId` must consist of exactly 8 characters, all of which can be uppercase letters or digits.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of `return.hotel.hotelId` is always equal to 8: `LENGTH(return.hotel.hotelId)==8`. This invariant is classified as a unary string fixed-length string invariant, indicating that the length of the string variable `hotelId` is consistently 8 characters.

### Analysis
Given the pattern defined in the Swagger specification for `hotelId`, it is clear that any valid `hotelId` must conform to the regex pattern which explicitly requires it to be exactly 8 characters long. Therefore, every valid response from the API will include a `hotelId` that is guaranteed to have a length of 8 characters. The invariant correctly reflects this requirement.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant accurately describes the constraints imposed by the Swagger definition, it holds true for every valid request to the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

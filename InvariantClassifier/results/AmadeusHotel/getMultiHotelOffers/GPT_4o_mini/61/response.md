### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that accepts a query parameter `roomQuantity`, which specifies the number of rooms requested. The valid range for `roomQuantity` is between 1 and 9. The response includes an array of offers, where each offer contains a `room` object with a property `typeEstimated` that includes `beds`, representing the number of beds in the room, which can also range from 1 to 9.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter `roomQuantity` must be greater than or equal to the number of beds in the returned room's `typeEstimated` property. In other words, it asserts that the number of rooms requested should be at least as many as the number of beds in the room offered.

### Analysis
1. **Input Constraints**: The `roomQuantity` can take values from 1 to 9.
2. **Output Constraints**: The `beds` property can also take values from 1 to 9.
3. **Logical Evaluation**: The invariant `input.roomQuantity >= return.room.typeEstimated.beds` implies that if a user requests a certain number of rooms, the number of beds in the room must not exceed the number of rooms requested. 
4. **Counterexample**: Consider a scenario where a user requests `roomQuantity = 1` (the minimum valid input), but the API returns a room with `typeEstimated.beds = 2`. In this case, the invariant would not hold, as `1 < 2`. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for all valid requests.

### Conclusion
The invariant is not universally true for all valid requests to the API, as there are scenarios where the number of beds in a room can exceed the number of rooms requested. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:

  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
      - name: roomQuantity
        in: query
        description: Number of rooms requested (1-9).
        type: integer
        format: int32
        minimum: 1
        maxLength: 9
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:

                      type: object
                      properties:
                        typeEstimated:
                          type: object
                          description: estimated room category, bed type and number of beds in the room. This information has been parsed from the room description, and is thus only provided for informational purposes
                          properties:
                            beds:
                              type: integer
                              description: Number of beds in the room (1-9)

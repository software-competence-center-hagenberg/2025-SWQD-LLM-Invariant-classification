### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers` that returns a response with a structure containing an array of offers. Each offer includes a `policies` object, which in turn contains a `deposit` object. The `deposit` object has an `acceptedPayments` object, which includes an array of `creditCards`. The invariant in question focuses on the size of this `creditCards` array.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]` must be one of the values {7, 9}. This means that for any valid response from the API, the number of accepted credit card types must either be 7 or 9.

### Analysis
The invariant is a restrictive condition on the response data. However, the Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the number of accepted credit card types in the `creditCards` array. It only indicates that the `creditCards` is an array of strings, each with a minimum length of 2 and a maximum length of 2, but does not limit the number of items in the array. Therefore, it is entirely possible for the API to return a different number of accepted credit card types, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, etc.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant imposes a specific restriction on the size of the `creditCards` array that is not supported by the Swagger definition, it is incorrect. The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

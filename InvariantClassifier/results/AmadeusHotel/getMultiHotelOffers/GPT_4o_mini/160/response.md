### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `data`, which is an array of items. Each item in this array has two properties: `self` (a string) and `hotel` (an object containing a property `hotelId`). The `hotelId` is a string that must match a specific pattern (8 alphanumeric characters). 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.hotel.hotelId` is a substring of `return.self`. This means that the value of `hotelId` must be found within the value of `self` for every valid response from this endpoint. 

### Analysis
1. **Structure of Response**: The response structure allows for multiple hotel offers, each with its own `self` and `hotelId`. 
2. **Nature of `self` and `hotelId`**: The `self` property is a string that could represent a URL or identifier for the hotel offer, while `hotelId` is a specific identifier for the hotel. 
3. **Substring Relationship**: There is no inherent requirement in the Swagger definition that `hotelId` must be a substring of `self`. The `self` property could represent a completely different string that does not include `hotelId` at all. For example, if `self` is a URL like "https://api.example.com/hotels/ADPAR001/details" and `hotelId` is "ADPAR001", then `hotelId` is indeed a substring of `self`. However, if `self` is "https://api.example.com/hotels/XYZ123/details", then `hotelId` being "ADPAR001" would not satisfy the invariant. 

### Conclusion
Since there is no guarantee that `hotelId` will always be a substring of `self` based on the provided Swagger definition, the invariant cannot be considered universally true for all valid responses. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

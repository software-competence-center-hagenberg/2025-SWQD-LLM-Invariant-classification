### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided excerpt from the Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that returns hotel offers. The relevant part of the response schema indicates that the `endDate` field is a string that represents the end date of a price period, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.endDate` is a Date with the format YYYY/MM/DD. This implies that the date string should use slashes (/) as separators instead of dashes (-).

### Analysis
1. **Format Mismatch**: According to the Swagger definition, the `endDate` is specified to be in the format YYYY-MM-DD, which uses dashes as separators. The invariant incorrectly states that the format can be YYYY/MM/DD, which is not supported by the Swagger definition.
2. **Type Assertion**: The invariant asserts that `return.endDate` is a Date, but since it is defined as a string in the Swagger definition, this assertion is also incorrect. The invariant does not accurately reflect the type and format specified in the API documentation.

### Conclusion
Given the discrepancies between the invariant and the Swagger definition, particularly the incorrect format and type assertions, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. It does not hold true for every valid request on the API as defined in the Swagger documentation.

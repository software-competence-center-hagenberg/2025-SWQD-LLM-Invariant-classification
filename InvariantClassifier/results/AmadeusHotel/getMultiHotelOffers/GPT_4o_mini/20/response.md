### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at "/shopping/hotel-offers" that returns a response with a structure containing a property `data`, which is an array of `offers`. Each `offer` has a property `category`, which is a string that can take on specific values, as indicated by the examples provided (e.g., ASSOCIATION, FAMILY_PLAN).

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `category` of the returned offers should always equal "GOV". This is expressed as `return.category == "GOV"`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Response Structure**: The response structure indicates that the `category` field can take on values such as "ASSOCIATION" and "FAMILY_PLAN". However, there is no mention of "GOV" being a valid value for the `category` field in the examples or schema.
2. **Possible Values**: Since the `category` field is defined as a string and the examples provided do not include "GOV", it implies that "GOV" is not a valid value for `category`. Therefore, it cannot be guaranteed that `return.category` will ever equal "GOV" for any valid response from this endpoint.
3. **Invariant Type**: The invariant type indicates that it is checking for specific string values. Given that the valid values for `category` do not include "GOV", this invariant cannot hold true for every valid request.

### Conclusion
The invariant stating that `return.category == "GOV"` is a false-positive because it asserts a condition that cannot be satisfied based on the provided Swagger definition. The valid categories do not include "GOV", making this invariant incorrect for the API's response.

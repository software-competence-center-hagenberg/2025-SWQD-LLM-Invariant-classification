The invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that the 'creditCards' array in the response will always have a certain size, which may not be the case. The size of the 'creditCards' array is not explicitly constrained in the Swagger definition, and it may vary based on the specific hotel offers. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

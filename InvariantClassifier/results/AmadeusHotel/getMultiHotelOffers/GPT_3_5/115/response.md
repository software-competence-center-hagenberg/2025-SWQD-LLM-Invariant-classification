The invariant 'return.total is Numeric' is a false-positive. This is because the 'total' field in the response body is described as a string type in the Swagger definition. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that the 'total' field will always contain numeric values. The description in the Swagger definition clearly states that 'total' is a string type, and there is no constraint or validation that enforces it to be numeric. As a result, the invariant cannot be classified as true-positive.

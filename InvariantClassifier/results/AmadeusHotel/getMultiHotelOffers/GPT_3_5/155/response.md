## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/shopping/hotel-offers" with a query parameter named "paymentPolicy".
- The response schema includes a field named "data" which is an array of objects, each containing a field named "self" of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter "paymentPolicy" should be a substring of the return field "self" in the response.

## Analysis
The invariant is true-positive. Since the "paymentPolicy" is a query parameter used for filtering the response, it is reasonable to expect that the returned "self" field should contain the value of "paymentPolicy" as a substring. This ensures that the response contains only the relevant data based on the provided filter.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive

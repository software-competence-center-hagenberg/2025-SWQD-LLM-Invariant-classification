Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
      - name: paymentPolicy
        in: query
        description: Filter the response based on a specific payment type. NONE means all types (default).
        type: string
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                self:
                  type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.paymentPolicy is a substring of return.self

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString
Invariant description: Represents the substring invariant between two String scalars. Prints as x is a substring of y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.

The return fields refer to the path "data" in the response body.

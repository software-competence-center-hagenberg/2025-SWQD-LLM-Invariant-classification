The invariant states that the number of beds in the room should not be equal to the size of the array of accepted credit cards minus 1. This is a false-positive invariant because it assumes a specific relationship between the number of beds in the room and the size of the array of accepted credit cards, which may not hold true for every valid request on the API. The relationship between these two fields is not explicitly defined in the Swagger definition, and there could be valid scenarios where the invariant does not hold.

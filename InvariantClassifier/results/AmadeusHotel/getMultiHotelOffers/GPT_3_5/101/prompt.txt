Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
      - name: hotelIds
        in: query
        description: Amadeus property codes on 8 chars. Mandatory parameter for a search by predefined list of hotels.
        required: true
        example: [MCLONGHM]
        type: array
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                hotel:
                  type: object
                  description: Hotel Content
                  properties:
                    hotelId:
                      type: string
                      description: Amadeus Property Code (8 chars)
                      pattern: ^[A-Z0-9]{8}$
                      example: ADPAR001


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.hotel.hotelId in input.hotelIds[]

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.sequenceString.MemberString
Invariant description: Represents String scalars that are always members of a sequence of String values. Prints as x in y[] where x is a String scalar and y[] is a sequence of String.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data" in the response body.

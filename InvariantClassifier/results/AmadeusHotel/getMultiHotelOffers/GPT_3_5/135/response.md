## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at "/shopping/hotel-offers" that returns a response with a nested structure.
- The response contains an array of offers, each of which has a set of policies, and each policy has a deposit with accepted payments, including credit cards.
- The credit cards are represented as an array of strings.

## Invariant
The invariant states that all the elements of `return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]` have a fixed length of 2.

## Analysis
- The invariant checks the length of each element in the `creditCards` array to ensure that they are exactly 2 characters long.
- This invariant is specific to the length of the credit card strings and does not depend on any dynamic or contextual information.
- The invariant is well-defined and can be evaluated based on the response data.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a true-positive as it holds for every valid request on the API, ensuring that all credit card strings in the response have a fixed length of 2 characters.

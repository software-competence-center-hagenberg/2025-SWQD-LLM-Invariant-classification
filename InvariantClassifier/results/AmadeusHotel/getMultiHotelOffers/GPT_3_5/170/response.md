### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' is a GET request that expects a 'adults' query parameter in the request.
- The response body contains a nested structure with 'data.offers.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods' representing the accepted payment methods.

### Invariant
- The invariant 'input.adults % size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0' checks if the number of adults is divisible by the size of accepted payment methods without remainder.

### Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive because the number of adults is related to the payment methods in a hotel offer. There is no direct relationship between the number of adults and the accepted payment methods. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

### Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' is a GET request that returns a response with a schema containing a 'data' field, which is an array of offers.
- Each offer has a 'commission' field, which is an object with an 'amount' field representing the commission paid to the travel seller.

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the 'amount' field in the 'commission' object of each offer is one of the values {"1.78", "2.74"}.

## Analysis
The invariant is checking a specific value constraint on the 'amount' field within the 'commission' object of each offer in the response. This constraint is not explicitly defined in the Swagger definition, and it's unclear if the API is designed to always return 'amount' values of only {"1.78", "2.74"}.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive. It cannot be guaranteed that the 'amount' field in the 'commission' object of each offer will always be one of the specified values. Therefore, the invariant is not true for every valid request on the API.

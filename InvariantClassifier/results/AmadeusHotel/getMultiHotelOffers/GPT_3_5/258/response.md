### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET method with a response schema that includes nested properties such as 'data', 'offers', 'policies', 'cancellation', and 'deposit'.
- The 'acceptedPayments' property under 'deposit' contains an array of credit card types.

### Invariant
- The invariant checks if the size of the array 'return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]' is divisible by 'return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights' without a remainder.

### Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive because there is no direct relationship between the size of the 'creditCards' array and the 'numberOfNights' property. These properties represent different aspects of hotel offers and do not have a mathematical relationship that guarantees the invariant to hold true for every valid request.

### Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API as there is no inherent mathematical relationship between the specified properties.

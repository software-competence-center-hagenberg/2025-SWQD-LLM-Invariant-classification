Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
      - name: hotelIds
        in: query
        description: Amadeus property codes on 8 chars. Mandatory parameter for a search by predefined list of hotels.
        required: true
        example: [MCLONGHM]
        type: array
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    policies:
                      type: object
                      description: Booking Rules
                      properties:
                        cancellation:
                          type: object
                          properties:
                            numberOfNights:
                              type: integer
                              description: Number of nights due as fee in case of cancellation.

Invariant: return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights != size(input.hotelIds[])

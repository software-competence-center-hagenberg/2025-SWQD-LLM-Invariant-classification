## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint "GET /shopping/hotel-offers" takes a query parameter "hotelIds" which is a mandatory array of hotel codes.
- The response body contains a nested structure with "data.offers" and within that, there are "policies.cancellation.numberOfNights" for each offer.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the value of "return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights" should not be equal to the size of the input array "input.hotelIds[]".

## Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive because there is no direct relationship between the number of hotelIds provided in the request and the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation for each offer in the response.
- The size of the input array does not determine the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation for each offer.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

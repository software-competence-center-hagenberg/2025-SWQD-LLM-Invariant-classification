Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    policies:
                      type: object
                      description: Booking Rules
                      properties:
                        cancellation:
                          type: object
                          properties:
                            deadline:
                              type: string
                              description: Represents the deadline after which the penalty applies. DateTime is in ISO 8601 [https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime].
                              Example: 2010-08-14T12:00:00+01:00
                              Example: 2010-08-14T12:00:00Z
                              Example: 2010-08-14T12:00:00-01:00
                              The value is expressed in the hotel local time zone, with the added time zone difference. So you can compute the deadline in UTC(GMT) if desired.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.policies.cancellation.deadline)==25

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body.

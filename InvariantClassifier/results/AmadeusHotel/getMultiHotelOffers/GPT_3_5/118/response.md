## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a response schema that includes a nested structure with an array of offers, each containing a checkInDate field.
- The checkInDate field is described as a string with a specific format and a constraint that it should not be in the past.

## Invariant
The invariant states that return.checkInDate is a Date with the format YYYY/MM/DD.

## Analysis
The provided Swagger definition specifies the format of the checkInDate as YYYY-MM-DD, which is different from the format specified in the invariant (YYYY/MM/DD). Additionally, the constraint that the date should not be in the past is not explicitly enforced by the format itself.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive. It does not hold for every valid request on the API because the format specified in the invariant does not match the format specified in the Swagger definition, and the constraint is not enforced by the format.

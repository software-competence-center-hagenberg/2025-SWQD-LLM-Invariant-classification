The invariant size(input.hotelIds[]) >= size(return.data[]) is a false-positive. This is because the size of the input.hotelIds[] array does not necessarily have a direct relationship with the size of the return.data[] array. The API may return hotel offers that are not directly related to the input hotelIds, such as nearby offers or alternative options. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

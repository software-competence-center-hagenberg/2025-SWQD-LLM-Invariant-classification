The invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that the 'changes' array and 'creditCards' array will always have the same size, which may not be true in all cases. The size of 'changes' array depends on the variation in prices during the stay, while the size of 'creditCards' array depends on the accepted payment methods and card types. These two arrays are not directly related, and their sizes may differ based on different hotel offers and policies. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The provided Swagger definition contains a 'get' endpoint for '/shopping/hotel-offers' which returns a response with a 'data' field containing an array of 'offers'.
- Each 'offer' contains 'policies' with 'deposit' and 'cancellation' properties.
- The 'deposit' property contains 'acceptedPayments' with 'methods' as an array of accepted payment methods.
- The 'cancellation' property contains a 'type' which is a string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the 'cancellation' type in 'policies' should be a member of the accepted payment methods in 'acceptedPayments.methods'.

### Analysis
The invariant is false-positive because 'cancellation.type' and 'deposit.acceptedPayments.methods' are not directly related. The 'cancellation.type' and 'deposit.acceptedPayments.methods' are independent properties of the 'policies' object and do not have a direct relationship as implied by the invariant.

### Conclusion
The invariant is false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

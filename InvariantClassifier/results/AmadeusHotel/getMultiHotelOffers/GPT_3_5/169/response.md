The invariant checks if the size of the 'creditCards' array in the response is divisible by (input.adults - 1). This means that the number of credit cards accepted should be related to the number of adult guests in a way that the size of the 'creditCards' array minus 1 is divisible by the number of adult guests. This invariant is false-positive because the number of credit cards accepted does not necessarily have a direct relationship with the number of adult guests. It is possible for a hotel to accept a certain number of credit cards regardless of the number of adult guests. Therefore, this invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

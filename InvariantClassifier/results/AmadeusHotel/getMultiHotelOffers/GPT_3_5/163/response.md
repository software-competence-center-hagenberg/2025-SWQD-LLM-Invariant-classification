## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a response schema that includes a nested structure.
- The relevant field for the invariant is "data.offers.room.typeEstimated.beds".

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking if the value of "beds" in the response is one of {1, 2, 3}.

## Analysis
- The invariant is checking a specific value in the response schema, ensuring that the number of beds falls within a specific range.
- The schema does not explicitly enforce this constraint, so the invariant is checking a property that is not explicitly defined in the schema.
- The invariant assumes that the response will always contain a valid value for "beds" within the specified range.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive. It assumes a constraint that is not explicitly defined in the schema and does not account for the possibility of other valid values for "beds" in the response.

**Swagger Definition Breakdown**

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The endpoint expects a query parameter 'hotelIds' which is a mandatory parameter for searching by a predefined list of hotels. The response contains an array of offers, and each offer includes a 'policies' object, which in turn includes a 'deposit' object. The 'deposit' object contains information about the deposit/prepay policy, including 'acceptedPayments' which includes 'creditCards' as an array of accepted payment card types.

**Invariant**

The invariant states that the size of the 'hotelIds' array in the request should not be equal to the size of the 'creditCards' array in the response minus 1.

**Analysis**

The invariant is false-positive. The size of the 'hotelIds' array in the request and the size of the 'creditCards' array in the response are unrelated and do not have a direct correlation. The size of the 'hotelIds' array in the request does not have any direct relationship with the size of the 'creditCards' array in the response. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

**Conclusion**

The invariant is false-positive.

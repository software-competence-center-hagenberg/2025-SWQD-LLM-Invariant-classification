The invariant size(input.hotelIds[])-1 >= size(return.data[])-1 is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the size of the 'hotelIds' array in the request parameters may not necessarily correspond to the size of the 'data' array in the response. The number of hotelIds provided in the request does not directly correlate to the number of hotel offers returned in the response. Therefore, this invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

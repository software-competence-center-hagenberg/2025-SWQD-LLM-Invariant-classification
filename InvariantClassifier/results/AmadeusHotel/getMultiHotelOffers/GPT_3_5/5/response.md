## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET method with a parameter "adults" in the query.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with properties such as "data", "offers", and "policies".
- The field "acceptedPayments.methods" is an array within the response schema.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the number of adults in the input should be equal to the size of the array "return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]" in the response.

## Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive because there is no direct relationship between the number of adults and the size of the array "return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]" in the response.
- The number of adults is a request parameter, while the size of the array is a property of the response.
- There is no indication in the Swagger definition that the number of adults should be related to the size of the array in the response.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive

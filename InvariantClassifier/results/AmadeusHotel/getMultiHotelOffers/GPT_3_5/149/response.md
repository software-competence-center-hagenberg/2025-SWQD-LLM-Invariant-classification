## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' is a GET request to retrieve multiple hotel offers.
- The response schema includes a 'data' field, which is an array of hotel objects.
- Each hotel object has a 'cityCode' field, which is a string representing the IATA city code associated with the hotel.
- The 'cityCode' field has a pattern constraint of ^[A-Z]{3}$, indicating that it should be a 3-character uppercase alphabetic string.

## Invariant
- The invariant LENGTH(return.hotel.cityCode)==3 checks if the length of the 'cityCode' in the response is always 3.

## Analysis
- The swagger definition specifies a pattern constraint on the 'cityCode' field, ensuring that it is a 3-character uppercase alphabetic string. Therefore, the invariant LENGTH(return.hotel.cityCode)==3 is redundant and unnecessary.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive.

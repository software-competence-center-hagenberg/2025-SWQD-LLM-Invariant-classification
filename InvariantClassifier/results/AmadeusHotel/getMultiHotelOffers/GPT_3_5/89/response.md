The invariant states that the size of 'return.price.taxes[]' minus 1 is not equal to the size of 'return.price.variations.changes[]'. This means that the number of tax items minus 1 is not equal to the number of price variations changes. Given the complex structure of the response body and the potential variability in the number of tax items and price variations changes, it is likely that this invariant is a false-positive. The complex nesting and potential variability make it difficult to guarantee that this invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

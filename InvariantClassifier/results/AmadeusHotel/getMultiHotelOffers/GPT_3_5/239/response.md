The invariant states that the size of the 'taxes' array in the 'price' object should be less than or equal to the size of the 'methods' array in the 'acceptedPayments' object within the 'deposit' object. This invariant is based on the structure of the response body and aims to ensure that the number of taxes is less than or equal to the number of accepted payment methods. Let's analyze the structure of the response body and the invariant to determine its correctness.

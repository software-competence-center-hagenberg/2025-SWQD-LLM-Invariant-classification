The invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is comparing two different items in the 'items' array within the 'data.offers' response. The 'return.room.typeEstimated.beds' and 'return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights' are not related to the same 'items' array element, so the comparison between them does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a summary "getMultiHotelOffers".
- The response schema includes a nested structure with properties such as "data", "offers", and "policies".
- The "cancellation" property under "policies" has a nested structure with a "type" property of type string.
- The enum for the "type" property includes a single value "FULL_STAY".

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the length of the string value of "return.policies.cancellation.type" is equal to 9.

## Analysis
The provided invariant is false-positive. The enum for the "type" property includes only one value, "FULL_STAY", which has a length of 9. However, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, as it assumes that the length of the string will always be 9, which may not be the case if the enum values change in the future.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

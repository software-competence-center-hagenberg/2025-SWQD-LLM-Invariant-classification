## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' is a GET request that returns hotel offers.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with 'data.offers.price.taxes' containing the 'percentage' field.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.percentage is Numeric' checks if the 'percentage' field in 'data.offers.price.taxes' is always numeric.

## Analysis
The provided invariant is false-positive. The reason is that the 'percentage' field is described as a string type in the Swagger definition, and the invariant checks for numeric values. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
The invariant 'return.percentage is Numeric' is false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

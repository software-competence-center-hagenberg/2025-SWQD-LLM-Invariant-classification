The invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that both `return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]` and `return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights` will always exist and have a specific relationship. However, the presence and structure of these fields are not guaranteed for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request, making it a false-positive.

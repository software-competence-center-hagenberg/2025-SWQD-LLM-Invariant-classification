The invariant is false-positive. The 'input.roomQuantity' is a request parameter, and the 'return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]' is a field in the response body. The invariant assumes a relationship between these two fields, but there is no direct connection between 'roomQuantity' and 'acceptedPayments.methods[]' in the API definition. The 'acceptedPayments.methods[]' is a list of accepted payment methods, and there is no direct correlation between the number of rooms requested and the payment methods accepted. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

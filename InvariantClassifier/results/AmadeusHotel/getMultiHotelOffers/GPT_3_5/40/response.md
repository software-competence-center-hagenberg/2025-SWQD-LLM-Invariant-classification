### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition contains a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema includes a nested structure with properties such as `data`, `offers`, and `policies`. Within the `policies` object, there is a `deposit` object containing `acceptedPayments` with a `methods` array.

### Invariant

The invariant specifies that the `methods` array within `return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments` should contain either the value `[CREDIT_CARD]` or the values `[CREDIT_CARD, ADVANCE_DEPOSIT]`.

### Analysis

Based on the provided Swagger definition, the invariant is a false-positive. The `methods` array is described as accepting various payment methods, including credit card, advance deposit, agency account, travel agent ID, corporate ID, hotel guest ID, check, miscellaneous charge order, advance deposit, and company address. Therefore, the invariant does not hold true for every valid request on the API.

### Conclusion

Verdict: false-positive

The invariant does not hold true for every valid request on the API, as the `methods` array can contain values other than `[CREDIT_CARD]` or `[CREDIT_CARD, ADVANCE_DEPOSIT]`.

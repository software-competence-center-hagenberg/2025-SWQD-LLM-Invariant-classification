The invariant provided is false-positive. The invariant compares the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation with the square of the size of accepted payment methods. There is no direct relationship between these two fields, and the comparison does not hold for every valid request on the API. The size of accepted payment methods does not have a direct correlation with the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation, making this invariant incorrect.

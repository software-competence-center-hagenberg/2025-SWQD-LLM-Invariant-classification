### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition contains a GET endpoint at '/shopping/hotel-offers' with a summary 'getMultiHotelOffers'. The response schema includes a 'data' field which contains an array of 'offers', and each 'offer' contains a 'price' field.

### Invariant

The invariant 'return.price != null' checks if the 'price' field in each 'offer' is not null.

### Analysis

Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'price' field is described as an object, and the invariant 'return.price != null' checks for null values. Since an object cannot be null, the invariant 'return.price != null' is a false-positive.

### Conclusion

The invariant 'return.price != null' is a false-positive as it does not hold for the response schema described in the Swagger definition.

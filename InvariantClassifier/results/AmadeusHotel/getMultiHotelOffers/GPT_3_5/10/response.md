The invariant return.rateFamilyEstimated.code == return.category is a false-positive. This is because the return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body, and there is no direct correlation between the rateFamilyEstimated.code and category fields at this level. The rateFamilyEstimated.code and category fields are nested within different arrays, and there is no explicit relationship defined between them. Therefore, this invariant will not hold for every valid request on the API.

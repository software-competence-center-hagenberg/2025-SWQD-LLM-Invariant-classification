## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers".
- The response schema includes a property "data" which is an array of hotel objects.
- Each hotel object has a property "chainCode" which is a string.
- The "chainCode" property has a pattern constraint that specifies a fixed length of 2 characters.

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the length of the "chainCode" in the response is always 2 characters.

## Analysis
Based on the swagger definition, the pattern constraint on the "chainCode" property ensures that it always has a fixed length of 2 characters. Therefore, the invariant holds true for every valid response from the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive

The invariant holds true for every valid response from the API because the pattern constraint ensures that the length of "chainCode" is always 2 characters.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a summary "getMultiHotelOffers".
- The response schema includes a nested structure with an array of offers, each containing a roomQuantity field.

## Invariant
- The invariant is LENGTH(return.roomQuantity)==1, which specifies that the length of the roomQuantity field in the response must always be 1.

## Analysis
- The response schema does not enforce a fixed length for the roomQuantity field. It only specifies that it is a string with a description of the range (1-9).
- The invariant does not align with the response schema and does not hold true for every valid response.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET method that returns a response with a nested structure.
- The response contains a field "data" which is an array of hotel offers.
- Each offer has a field "price" which contains price information.
- The price information includes a field "variations" which contains daily price variations and average daily price information.
- The average daily price information includes a field "total" which represents the total price.

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the value of "return.price.variations.average.total" is equal to "126.73".

## Analysis
The invariant is checking a specific value for the total price in the response. However, the invariant does not take into account the variability of the response data. It assumes that the total price will always be "126.73", which may not hold true for every valid request on the API. The actual total price may vary depending on the hotel offers and their pricing.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it does not hold for every valid request on the API. The total price in the response may vary, and it cannot be guaranteed to be "126.73" for all cases.

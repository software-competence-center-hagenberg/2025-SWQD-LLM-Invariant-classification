## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a response schema that includes a nested structure.
- The nested structure contains an array of offers, each with a set of policies, and within the policies, there is a deposit object with an amount field.

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking if the return field "policies.deposit.amount" is equal to "0.00".

## Analysis
- The invariant is checking a specific value ("0.00") for the field "policies.deposit.amount" within the response body.
- However, the schema does not guarantee that every offer will have a deposit with an amount of "0.00". It only specifies the structure of the response, not the specific values.
- Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive because it assumes a specific value for a field that is not guaranteed to be present or have that value in every valid response.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive.

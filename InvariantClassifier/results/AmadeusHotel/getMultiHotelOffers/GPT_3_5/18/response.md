## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a response schema that includes a field "data.offers" containing an array of hotel offers.
- Each offer in the array includes a "checkInDate" field of type string, representing the check-in date of the stay.
- The example provided for the "checkInDate" field is in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" and includes a specific date.

## Invariant
The invariant specifies that the "checkInDate" in the response should be one of { "2022-09-20", "2022-09-21", "2022-09-22" }.

## Analysis
The provided invariant is false-positive. The example date in the response does not match the specified values in the invariant. Additionally, the example date provided is in the past, which contradicts the description in the Swagger definition that states "The lowest accepted value is today date (no dates in the past)". Therefore, the invariant does not hold for the given Swagger definition.

## Conclusion
The invariant is false-positive.

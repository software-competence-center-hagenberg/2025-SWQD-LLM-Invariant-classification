## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/shopping/hotel-offers"
- The response schema includes a nested structure with properties such as "data", "offers", "price", "variations", "average", "total", "policies", and "deposit"
- The invariant refers to the relationship between the "total" field under "variations.average" and the "methods" array under "acceptedPayments" within the "deposit" object

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the value of "return.price.variations.average.total" is present in the array "return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]"

## Analysis
- The invariant is checking for a relationship between a price total and accepted payment methods
- It assumes that the total price should be a valid payment method, which may not be the case in a real-world scenario
- There is no direct relationship between the price total and the accepted payment methods in the response schema

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because there is no inherent relationship between the price total and the accepted payment methods in the response schema. Therefore, it will not hold for every valid request on the API.

The invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the 'size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards[])' and 'return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights' are not directly related in the response schema. The 'size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.creditCards[])' represents the number of accepted payment card types, while 'return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights' represents the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation. There is no direct relationship or dependency between these two values in the response schema, so the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

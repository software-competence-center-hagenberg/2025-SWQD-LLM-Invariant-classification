The invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that both 'acceptedPayments.creditCards' and 'acceptedPayments.methods' arrays will always have the same length, which may not be true in all cases. In a real-world scenario, the lengths of these arrays may not be directly related, and the invariant may not hold for every valid request on the API.

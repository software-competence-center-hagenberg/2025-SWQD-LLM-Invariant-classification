The invariant checks if the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation is divisible by the size of the daily price changes array. This is to ensure that the number of nights evenly divides the number of price changes. The invariant type is daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.NumericInt$Divides, which represents the divides without remainder invariant between two long scalars. The invariant is applied to the fields in the response body under the path "data.offers".

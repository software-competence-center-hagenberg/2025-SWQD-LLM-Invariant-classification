The invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the 'return' field refers to the path 'data.offers' in the response body, but the invariant references fields that are not present in the response schema. Specifically, the 'policies' and 'deposit' fields are not present in the response schema, so the invariant cannot be evaluated against the given response schema. Therefore, the invariant is not applicable and is considered a false-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a response schema that includes a nested structure with the following path: "data.offers.price.taxes.amount".

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the field "amount" within the path "data.offers.price.taxes" in the response body is Numeric.

## Analysis
- The provided response schema does not enforce the data type of the field "amount" within the path "data.offers.price.taxes" to be numeric. The schema allows the field to be a string type, and it does not specify any validation for the numeric nature of the value.

## Conclusion
- The invariant is a false-positive as the response schema does not guarantee that the field "amount" within the path "data.offers.price.taxes" is always numeric.

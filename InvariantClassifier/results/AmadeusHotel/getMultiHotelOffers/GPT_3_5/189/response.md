### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' is a GET request that expects a query parameter 'hotelIds' which is a mandatory array of strings.
- The response body contains a nested structure with 'data.offers' and 'policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods'.

### Invariant
- The invariant 'size(input.hotelIds[])-1 % size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0' checks if the size of 'hotelIds' array minus 1 is divisible by the size of 'acceptedPayments.methods' array in the response.

### Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive because the size of 'hotelIds' array minus 1 may not always be divisible by the size of 'acceptedPayments.methods' array in the response. The relationship between these two arrays is not explicitly defined in the API specification, and there is no guarantee that the sizes will have a specific mathematical relationship.

### Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive

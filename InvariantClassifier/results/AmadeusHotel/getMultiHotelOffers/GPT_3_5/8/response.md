## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/shopping/hotel-offers" with a query parameter "boardType".
- The response schema includes a nested structure with an array of offers, each containing a "boardType" field.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the input "boardType" should be equal to the return "boardType" in the response.

## Analysis
- The API does not guarantee that the input "boardType" will be equal to the return "boardType" in the response. The response includes an array of offers, and there is no indication that the input "boardType" will match any specific offer's "boardType" in the response.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is /shopping/hotel-offers with a GET method.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with an array of offers, each containing a price object with a base field.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that return.price.base is Numeric, indicating that the base field in the price object should always contain numeric characters.

## Analysis
- The provided swagger definition does not enforce any specific data type for the base field within the price object.
- Without explicit validation in the schema, the API cannot guarantee that return.price.base will always be numeric.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive as it assumes a constraint that is not enforced by the API definition.

The invariant 'return.base is Numeric' refers to the 'base' field in the 'changes' array within the 'variations' object, which is nested within the 'price' object, which is nested within the 'offers' array, which is nested within the 'data' object in the response body. The invariant assumes that the 'base' field in every 'changes' array will always be numeric. However, based on the provided Swagger definition, there is no guarantee that the 'base' field will always be numeric. Therefore, this invariant is a false-positive.

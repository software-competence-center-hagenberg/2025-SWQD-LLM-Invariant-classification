The invariant is false-positive. The reason is that the invariant refers to the relationship between the sizes of two arrays in the response body. However, the provided Swagger definition does not contain information about the exact structure of the response body, making it impossible to determine the sizes of the arrays. Therefore, the invariant cannot be evaluated accurately and is considered a false-positive.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET method that returns a response with a 'data' field containing an array of 'offers'.
- Each 'offer' contains 'room' and 'policies' properties.
- The 'room' property contains 'typeEstimated' with a 'beds' field.
- The 'policies' property contains 'deposit' with 'acceptedPayments' that has 'methods' field, which is an array of strings.

### Invariant
The invariant is: return.room.typeEstimated.beds % size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0

### Analysis
The invariant checks if the number of beds in the room is divisible by the number of accepted payment methods without a remainder. This may not hold true for every valid request on the API. The number of beds in a room and the number of accepted payment methods are independent properties and may not have a direct relationship that ensures divisibility without a remainder.

### Conclusion
The invariant 'return.room.typeEstimated.beds % size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]) == 0' is a false-positive.

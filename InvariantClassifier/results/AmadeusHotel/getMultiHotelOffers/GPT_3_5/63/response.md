The invariant input.roomQuantity >= size(return.price.taxes[])-1 is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is comparing the roomQuantity parameter with the size of the taxes array in the response. However, the size of the taxes array may not always directly correspond to the roomQuantity parameter. The number of taxes in the response may not be directly related to the number of rooms requested. Therefore, this invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

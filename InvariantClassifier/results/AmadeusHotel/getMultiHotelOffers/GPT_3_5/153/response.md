## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/shopping/hotel-offers" with a query parameter "countryOfResidence".
- The response schema includes an array of objects with a property "self".

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the value of the query parameter "countryOfResidence" should be a substring of the value of the property "self" in the response.

## Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive because the property "self" is not nested within the array items, so it does not directly correspond to the query parameter "countryOfResidence".
- The invariant assumes a direct relationship between the query parameter and the response property, which is not the case in this API.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive

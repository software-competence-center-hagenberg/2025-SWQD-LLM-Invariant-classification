The invariant input.roomQuantity >= size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[])-1 is false-positive. The reason for this is that the 'acceptedPayments.methods' field is an array, and the size of an array is the number of elements it contains. Therefore, the comparison input.roomQuantity >= size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[])-1 does not make sense in this context. The comparison is between a single value (roomQuantity) and the size of an array, which is not a valid comparison for this scenario. Additionally, the '-1' in the comparison does not have a clear rationale. Therefore, this invariant is not valid for the given REST API definition.

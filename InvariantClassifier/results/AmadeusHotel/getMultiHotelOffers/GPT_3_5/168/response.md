The invariant checks if the number of adults input is divisible by the size of the array of accepted payment methods in the response. This is a false-positive invariant because the number of adults input is unrelated to the size of the array of accepted payment methods in the response. The invariant does not capture any meaningful relationship between the input and the response, and it is not a valid condition for the API.

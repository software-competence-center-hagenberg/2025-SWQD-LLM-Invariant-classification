## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a response schema that includes a nested structure.
- The response schema contains an array of offers, each of which contains a nested array of guests.

## Invariant
- The invariant is `return.guests != null`, which checks if the `guests` field in the response is not null.

## Analysis
- The invariant is checking for the presence of the `guests` field in the response, but it does not account for the nested structure of the response schema.
- Since the response schema includes nested arrays, the invariant should consider the possibility of `guests` being null within the nested arrays as well.

## Conclusion
- The invariant is a false-positive because it does not accurately capture the nested structure of the response schema. It should be modified to account for the nested arrays and check for the presence of `guests` within the nested arrays as well.

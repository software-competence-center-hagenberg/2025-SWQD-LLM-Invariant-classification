### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/shopping/hotel-offers"
- The response schema includes a nested structure with properties such as "data", "offers", and "policies"
- The specific invariant refers to the field "return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]" in the response body

### Invariant
The invariant specifies that the field "return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]" should contain only the value "CREDIT_CARD"

### Analysis
The invariant is checking if the "methods" array under "acceptedPayments" contains only the value "CREDIT_CARD". However, the provided Swagger definition does not guarantee that the "methods" array will only contain the value "CREDIT_CARD". It allows for multiple payment methods, as described in the Swagger definition.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API, based on the provided Swagger definition.

- Each object in the "data.offers" array has a field "rateCode" of type string with a minimum length of 3 and a maximum length of 3.

### Invariant

### Analysis
- The Swagger definition clearly states that the "rateCode" field has a minimum length of 3 and a maximum length of 3, which aligns with the invariant LENGTH(return.rateCode)==3.
- As per the definition, the length of the "rateCode" field will always be 3, making the invariant true-positive.

### Conclusion
Based on the Swagger definition and the nature of the "rateCode" field, the invariant LENGTH(return.rateCode)==3 is true-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET method with a summary of "getMultiHotelOffers".
- The response schema includes a nested structure with an array of offers, each containing a price object with a currency field.

## Invariant
- The invariant is LENGTH(return.price.currency)==3, which checks if the length of the currency code in the response is always 3.

## Analysis
- The provided Swagger definition does not explicitly enforce a fixed length for the currency code.
- The invariant assumes that the length of the currency code will always be 3, which is not guaranteed by the API definition.
- It is possible that the currency code may have a different length in valid responses.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive.

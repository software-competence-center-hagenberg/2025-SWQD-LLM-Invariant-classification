The invariant is false-positive. The invariant is comparing the number of beds in a room with the size of the array of accepted payment methods minus 1. This comparison does not seem to have a meaningful relationship and may not hold true for every valid request on the API. The comparison between the number of beds and the size of the array of accepted payment methods does not seem to be a valid business logic or data relationship. Therefore, the invariant is not a true-positive.

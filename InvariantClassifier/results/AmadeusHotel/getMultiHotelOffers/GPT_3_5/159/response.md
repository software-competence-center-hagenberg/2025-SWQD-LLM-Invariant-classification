## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a summary "getMultiHotelOffers".
- The response schema includes a field "data" which is an array of objects.
- Each object in the array has a field "hotel" which is an object with a field "type".
- The field "type" inside "hotel" is of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the field "return.hotel.type" is a substring of "return.type".

## Analysis
The provided Swagger definition does not include a field named "return.type" directly. Instead, the response schema includes a field named "data" which contains an array of objects. Each object in the array has a field "hotel" with a field "type". Therefore, the invariant "return.hotel.type is a substring of return.type" does not directly align with the structure of the response schema.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive. It does not hold for the given Swagger definition as there is no direct field named "return.type" in the response schema.

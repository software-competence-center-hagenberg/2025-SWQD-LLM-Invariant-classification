## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a response schema that includes a nested structure of objects and arrays.
- The specific field of interest for the invariant is "data.offers.price.taxes.pricingFrequency".

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the field "pricingFrequency" in the response must be one of { "PER_NIGHT", "PER_STAY" }.

## Analysis
- The provided response schema does not explicitly enforce the values of "pricingFrequency" to be limited to { "PER_NIGHT", "PER_STAY" }.
- The schema allows for any string value to be present in the "pricingFrequency" field.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive. It does not hold for every valid request on the API.

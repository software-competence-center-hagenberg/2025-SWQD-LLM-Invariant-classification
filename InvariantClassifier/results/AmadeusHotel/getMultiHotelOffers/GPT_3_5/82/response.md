### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET method that returns hotel offers.
- The response body contains a 'data' field, which is an array of offers.
- Each offer has a 'policies' field, which contains 'deposit' and 'cancellation' subfields.
- The 'deposit' subfield contains 'acceptedPayments' with a 'methods' array of accepted payment methods.
- The 'cancellation' subfield contains a 'description' subfield with free text.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the 'cancellation.description.text' in each offer should be a member of the 'deposit.acceptedPayments.methods' array.

### Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive because there is no direct relationship between the cancellation description and the accepted payment methods. These two fields represent different aspects of the offer and are not inherently related.
- The cancellation description provides information about the cancellation policy, while the accepted payment methods indicate the methods of payment accepted for the offer.
- It is not a valid assumption that the cancellation description should be a member of the accepted payment methods.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

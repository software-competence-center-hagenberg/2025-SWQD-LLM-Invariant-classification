### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation that returns a response with a nested structure.
- The 'changes' field is nested within 'variations' which is nested within 'price' which is nested within 'offers' which is nested within 'data'.
- The 'startDate' field is a string representing the begin date of a price period.

### Invariant
- The invariant specifies that 'return.startDate' is a Date with the format YYYY/MM/DD.

### Analysis
- The provided Swagger definition does not match the format specified in the invariant. The format in the Swagger definition is YYYY-MM-DD, while the invariant expects YYYY/MM/DD.
- Additionally, the invariant does not account for the fact that the separator can be either '/' or '-'.

### Conclusion
- The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API. The format specified in the invariant does not match the format in the Swagger definition, and it does not consider the alternative separator.

The invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that both 'return.price.taxes[]' and 'return.policies.cancellation.numberOfNights' will always have a defined value and will be present in every response. However, in a real-world scenario, there might be responses where either of these fields is not present or is null, leading to a division by zero or an undefined result. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

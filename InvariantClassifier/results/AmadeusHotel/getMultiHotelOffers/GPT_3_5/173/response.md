The invariant checks if the number of beds in a room is divisible by the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation. The invariant type is daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.NumericInt$Divides, which represents the divides without remainder invariant between two long scalars. The return fields refer to the path "data.offers" in the response body. The invariant is false-positive because it assumes a specific relationship between the number of beds in a room and the number of nights due as a fee in case of cancellation, which may not hold true for every valid request on the API. There is no guarantee that the number of beds and the number of nights due as a fee will always have a divisible relationship.

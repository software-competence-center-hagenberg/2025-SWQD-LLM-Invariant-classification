## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a response schema that includes a nested structure with properties `self` and `hotelId`.
- The `hotelId` property has a pattern constraint that specifies it should be an 8-character string consisting of uppercase letters and digits.

## Invariant
The invariant states that `return.hotel.hotelId` is a substring of `return.self`.

## Analysis
The provided Swagger definition does not include a property named `return` in the response schema. It seems that the invariant is not aligned with the structure defined in the Swagger definition. Additionally, the structure of the response does not directly support the comparison of `hotelId` as a substring of `self`.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive as it does not align with the structure defined in the Swagger definition and is not applicable to the response schema.

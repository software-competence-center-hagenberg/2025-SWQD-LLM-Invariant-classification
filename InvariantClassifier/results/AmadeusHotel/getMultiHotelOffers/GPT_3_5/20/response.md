The invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant specifies that the return category should be "GOV", but the Swagger definition does not guarantee that the category will always be "GOV". The Swagger definition only provides an example of the category as "FAMILY_PLAN", and it allows for other values as well. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

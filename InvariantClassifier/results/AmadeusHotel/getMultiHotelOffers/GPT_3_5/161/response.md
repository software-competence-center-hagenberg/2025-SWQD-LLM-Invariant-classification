## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provided describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers.
- The response schema includes a 'data' array containing hotel objects, each with 'hotelId' and 'chainCode' properties.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that 'return.hotel.chainCode' is a substring of 'return.hotel.hotelId'.

## Analysis
- The provided swagger definition does not explicitly enforce the invariant in the response schema.
- The invariant is not directly related to the structure or constraints defined in the swagger.
- The invariant seems to be a custom business logic requirement rather than a standard REST API constraint.

## Conclusion
- The invariant is a false-positive as it is not enforced by the API definition and is not a standard REST API constraint.

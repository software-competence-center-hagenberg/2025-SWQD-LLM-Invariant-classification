The invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the 'input.adults' parameter and the 'return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]' are not directly related. The 'input.adults' parameter represents the number of adult guests per room, while 'return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]' represents the accepted payment methods for the hotel offer. There is no direct relationship between the number of adult guests and the accepted payment methods, so the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation with a summary 'getMultiHotelOffers'.
- The response schema includes a 'data' field containing an array of 'offers', each of which contains a 'room' field with a 'typeEstimated' property.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.room.typeEstimated != null' checks if the 'typeEstimated' property in the 'room' object is not null in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'typeEstimated' property is described as being provided for informational purposes, which implies that it may or may not be present in the response. Therefore, the invariant 'return.room.typeEstimated != null' is a false-positive.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

The invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the 'input.roomQuantity' and 'size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[])' are not directly related in the API definition. The 'input.roomQuantity' is a request parameter representing the number of rooms requested, while 'size(return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[])' represents the size of an array in the response body. There is no direct relationship between the two in the API definition, and therefore the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition contains a GET endpoint at '/shopping/hotel-offers' with a response schema that includes 'data', 'offers', and 'room' properties.

### Invariant

The invariant states that 'return.category' is a substring of 'return.room.description.text'. This means that the 'category' field within the 'offers' array should be a substring of the 'text' field within the 'description' object of the 'room' array.

### Analysis

Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'category' field is nested within the 'offers' array, and the 'text' field is nested within the 'description' object of the 'room' array. Therefore, the invariant is false-positive because there is no direct relationship between the 'category' and 'text' fields as required by the invariant.

### Conclusion

The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

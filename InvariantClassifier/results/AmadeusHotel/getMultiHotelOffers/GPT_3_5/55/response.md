### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET operation with a response schema that includes a nested structure.
- The 'data' field contains an array of 'offers', each of which has a 'policies' field.
- The 'policies' field contains a 'deposit' field, which in turn contains an 'acceptedPayments' field with a 'methods' array.
- The 'methods' array represents the accepted payment methods for the offer.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of 'return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]' should be one of {1, 2}.

### Analysis
The invariant checks if the size of the 'methods' array in the response is either 1 or 2. This ensures that the number of accepted payment methods for an offer is limited to a specific range.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a true-positive as it ensures a constraint on the number of accepted payment methods for an offer in the response.

The invariant 'return.policies.holdTime.deadline == "2022-09-20T18:00:00"' is false-positive. This is because the invariant assumes that the 'deadline' field in the response body will always have the value '2022-09-20T18:00:00', which may not be the case for every valid request on the API. The invariant does not account for the variability of the 'deadline' field in the response. Therefore, it cannot be classified as a true-positive invariant.

The invariant is false-positive. The invariant states that the size of 'return.price.variations.changes[]' should be greater than or equal to the size of 'return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods[]' minus 1. However, the provided Swagger definition does not guarantee that these two arrays are related in any way. There is no direct relationship between the 'price.variations.changes' and 'policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods' arrays in the response. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

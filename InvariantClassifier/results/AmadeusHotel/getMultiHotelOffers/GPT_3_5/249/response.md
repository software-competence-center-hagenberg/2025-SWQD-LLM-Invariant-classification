## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a summary "getMultiHotelOffers".
- The response schema includes a nested structure with an array of offers, each containing a category field.
- The category field is defined as a string with examples and an example value.

## Invariant
- The invariant is LENGTH(return.category)==3, which specifies that the length of the category field in the response should always be 3.

## Analysis
- The provided Swagger definition does not enforce a fixed length for the category field in the response schema.
- The example value provided for the category field does not have a length of 3, which indicates that the invariant does not hold for the given example.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive.

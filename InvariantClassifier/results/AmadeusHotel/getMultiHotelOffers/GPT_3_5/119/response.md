## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a response schema that includes a nested structure with a field "checkOutDate".
- The example provided for "checkOutDate" is in the format "Thu Dec 31 01:00:00 CET 2020", which does not match the format specified in the invariant (YYYY/MM/DD).

## Invariant
The invariant states that "return.checkOutDate is a Date. Format: YYYY/MM/DD".

## Analysis
The example provided in the Swagger definition does not match the format specified in the invariant. Additionally, the Swagger definition does not enforce the format of the "checkOutDate" field to be in the format YYYY/MM/DD.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it does not hold for every valid request on the API. The Swagger definition does not enforce the specified format for the "checkOutDate" field, and the example provided does not match the format specified in the invariant.

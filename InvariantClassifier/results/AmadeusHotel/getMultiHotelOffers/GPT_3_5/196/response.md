The invariant is false-positive. The invariant checks if the size of 'return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]' minus 1 is divisible by the size of 'return.price.variations.changes[]'. However, the provided Swagger definition does not contain any information about the size of these arrays or their relationship. Therefore, the invariant cannot be evaluated based on the given Swagger definition. As a result, the invariant is a false-positive.

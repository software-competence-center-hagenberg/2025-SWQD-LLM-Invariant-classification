The invariant 'return.price.markups == return.price.variations.average.markups' is a false-positive. This is because the 'return' object refers to the path 'data.offers', which is an array. Therefore, the comparison 'return.price.markups == return.price.variations.average.markups' does not make sense for an array of hotel offers. It seems that the invariant is trying to compare the markups of the first hotel offer with the markups of the average daily price variations of the first hotel offer, which is not a meaningful comparison. As a result, this invariant is not valid for every valid request on the API.

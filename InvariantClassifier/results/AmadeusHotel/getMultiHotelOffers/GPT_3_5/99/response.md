## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The Swagger definition provides a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers.
- The response schema includes a 'data' field containing an array of hotel objects.
- Each hotel object has a 'type' field of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant checks if the 'type' field of each hotel object in the response is equal to "hotel".

## Analysis
- The invariant checks a specific value of the 'type' field in the response.
- It assumes that the 'type' field of every hotel object in the response will be equal to "hotel".
- However, the Swagger definition does not enforce this constraint, and the 'type' field can have different values for different hotel objects.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive because it assumes a specific value for the 'type' field in the response, which is not guaranteed by the API definition.

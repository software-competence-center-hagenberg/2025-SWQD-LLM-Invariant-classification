## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with an array of offers, each containing a room object with a type property.
- The type property is described as a string with a specific format pattern.

## Invariant
The invariant LENGTH(return.room.type)==3 checks if the length of the room type code in the response is always 3 characters.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition, the room type code is defined to have a fixed length of 3 characters, as indicated by the pattern constraint in the schema. Therefore, the invariant LENGTH(return.room.type)==3 is true-positive and holds for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive

The invariant is true-positive as the length of the room type code is explicitly defined to be 3 characters in the response schema.

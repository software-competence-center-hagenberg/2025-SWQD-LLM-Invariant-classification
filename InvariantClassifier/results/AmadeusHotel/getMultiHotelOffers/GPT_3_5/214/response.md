The invariant input.adults >= size(return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[])-1 is false-positive.

Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a parameter 'adults' in the query with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum length of 9.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with 'data.offers' and 'policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods'.

Invariant Analysis:
- The invariant compares the value of 'input.adults' with the size of 'return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]' minus 1.
- However, the size of 'return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]' is not directly related to the 'adults' parameter.
- The invariant does not capture a meaningful relationship between the input and return fields.

Conclusion: The invariant is a false-positive as it does not accurately represent a meaningful relationship between the input and return fields for the given REST endpoint.

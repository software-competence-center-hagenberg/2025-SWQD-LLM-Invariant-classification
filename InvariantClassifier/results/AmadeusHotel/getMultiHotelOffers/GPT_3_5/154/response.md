The invariant states that the input currency should be a substring of the return self. This means that the currency provided in the request should be a substring of the self field in the response. However, based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'self' field in the response does not directly correspond to the currency parameter in the request. Therefore, this invariant is a false-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a response schema that includes a field "data" containing an array of "offers".
- Each offer has a field "boardType" which is a string with a predefined set of values.

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking if the "boardType" in the response is one of { "BREAKFAST", "ROOM_ONLY" }

## Analysis
- The invariant is checking if the "boardType" in the response is limited to two specific values: "BREAKFAST" and "ROOM_ONLY".
- The enum in the Swagger definition confirms that the "boardType" can indeed only have these two values.
- Therefore, the invariant is true-positive as it correctly captures the allowed values for "boardType".

## Conclusion
- Verdict: true-positive

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET method with a parameter named "checkInDate" in the query.
- The response schema includes a field "data" which is an array of objects, each containing a field "self" of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter "checkInDate" should be a substring of the return field "self" in the response.

## Analysis
The invariant is false-positive. The reason is that the return field "self" is a string, and the input parameter "checkInDate" is a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD. It is not meaningful to check if a date is a substring of a string. Therefore, this invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive

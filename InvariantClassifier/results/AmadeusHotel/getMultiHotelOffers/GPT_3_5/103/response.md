The invariant input.roomQuantity != size(return.offers[])-1 is intended to check if the number of rooms requested is not equal to the size of the returned hotel offers array minus 1. This invariant is false-positive because it does not hold for every valid request on the API. The size of the returned offers array may not always correspond directly to the number of rooms requested, and there could be other factors affecting the size of the array. Therefore, this invariant cannot be considered true-positive for the given REST API.

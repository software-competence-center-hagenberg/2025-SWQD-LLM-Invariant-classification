## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a response schema that includes a nested structure.
- The response body contains a field "data" which is an array of objects, each containing an "offers" field.
- The "offers" field is an array of objects, each containing a "price" field.
- The "price" field is an object with a "total" field of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant states that "return.price.total" is Numeric, indicating that the characters of the string variable are always numeric.

## Analysis
The provided invariant is false-positive. The reason is that the schema defines the "total" field as a string, which means it can contain non-numeric characters. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive

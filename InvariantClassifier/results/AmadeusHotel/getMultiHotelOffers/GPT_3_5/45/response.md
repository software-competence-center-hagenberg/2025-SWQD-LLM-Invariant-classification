The invariant 'return.policies.cancellation.type == "FULL_STAY"' is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the provided Swagger definition does not guarantee that the 'policies' field will always be present in the response, and even if it is present, there is no guarantee that it will contain the 'cancellation' field. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

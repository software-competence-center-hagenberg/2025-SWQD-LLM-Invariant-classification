## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a response schema that includes a nested structure.
- The response schema contains a field named "data" which is an array of objects, and each object has a field named "offers" which is an array of objects.
- Each object in the "offers" array has a field named "roomQuantity" which is described as a string representing the number of rooms.

## Invariant
The invariant states that "return.roomQuantity" is Numeric, indicating that the characters of the string variable are always numeric.

## Analysis
The response schema specifies the type of "roomQuantity" as a string, but it does not enforce that the characters of the string are always numeric. Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive because the API does not guarantee that the characters of "roomQuantity" are always numeric.

## Conclusion
The invariant "return.roomQuantity is Numeric" is a false-positive.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition contains a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema includes a nested structure with the following path: `data.offers.price.variations.changes.endDate`. The invariant refers to the `endDate` field within the `changes` array.

### Invariant

The invariant states that `return.endDate` is a Date with the format YYYY/MM/DD.

### Analysis

The Swagger definition specifies the format of the `endDate` field as YYYY-MM-DD, which does not match the format specified in the invariant (YYYY/MM/DD). Therefore, the invariant is false-positive.

### Conclusion

Verdict: false-positive

The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API because the format specified in the invariant does not match the format specified in the Swagger definition.

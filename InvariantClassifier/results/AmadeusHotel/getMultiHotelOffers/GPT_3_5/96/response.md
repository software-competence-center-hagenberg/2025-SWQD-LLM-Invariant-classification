## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a summary "getMultiHotelOffers".
- The response to this operation has a schema with a property "data" that is an array of objects, each having a property "type" of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the return type is "hotel-offers".

## Analysis
The invariant is checking the value of the "type" field in the response array. Since the schema specifies that the "type" field is of type string and has a description indicating that it represents the type of the object (hotel-offers), the invariant is true-positive.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive

The invariant holds true for every valid request on the API because the schema definition ensures that the "type" field in the response array will always be a string representing the type of the object, which is "hotel-offers".

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition contains a GET endpoint at "/shopping/hotel-offers" with a response schema that includes a nested structure of objects and arrays.
- The "rateFamilyEstimated" object contains a property "code" with a type of string and a pattern constraint of [A-Z0-9]{3}.

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking the length of the "code" field within the "rateFamilyEstimated" object in the response body.
- It specifies that the length of the "code" field should always be 3 characters.

## Analysis
- The swagger definition does enforce a pattern constraint on the "code" field, ensuring that it consists of 3 characters from the set [A-Z0-9].
- However, the invariant is redundant as the pattern constraint already guarantees the fixed length of 3 characters.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive as it duplicates the pattern constraint already specified in the swagger definition.

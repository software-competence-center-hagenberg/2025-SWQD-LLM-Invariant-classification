The invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on a mathematical relationship between the size of an array and the value of a field in the response body. However, the provided Swagger definition does not contain information about the size of the 'return.policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.creditCards[]' array or the value of 'return.room.typeEstimated.beds'. Without this information, it is not possible to determine if the invariant holds true for every valid request on the API.

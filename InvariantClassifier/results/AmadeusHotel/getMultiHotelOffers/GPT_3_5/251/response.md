## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET method with a summary of "getMultiHotelOffers".
- The response schema includes a nested structure with properties such as "data", "offers", and "policies".
- The "policies" object contains a "cancellation" object, which in turn contains a "description" object with a "lang" property.
- The "lang" property is described as a string with an example value of "fr-FR".

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the length of the string in the response field "policies.cancellation.description.lang" is always 2.

## Analysis
The provided Swagger definition does not explicitly enforce a fixed length for the "lang" property in the response. The example value "fr-FR" does have a length of 5, which contradicts the invariant.

## Conclusion
The invariant "LENGTH(return.policies.cancellation.description.lang)==2" is a false-positive. It does not hold for every valid request on the API, as demonstrated by the example value in the Swagger definition.

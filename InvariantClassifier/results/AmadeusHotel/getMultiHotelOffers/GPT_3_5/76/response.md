The invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the 'return.policies.cancellation.type' and 'return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]' are not directly related in the Swagger definition. The 'return.policies.cancellation.type' is a property of 'cancellation' under 'policies', while 'return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods[]' is a property of 'acceptedPayments' under 'guarantee'. There is no direct relationship between these two properties in the Swagger definition, and therefore the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/shopping/hotel-offers"
- The response schema includes a nested structure with properties such as "data", "offers", and "policies"
- The specific property of interest is "return.policies.cancellation.description.lang"

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the value of "return.policies.cancellation.description.lang" is equal to "EN"

## Analysis
The provided invariant is checking a specific string value in the response body. It is a unary string invariant that checks if the value is equal to a specific string "EN".

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive. This is because the provided Swagger definition does not guarantee that the property "return.policies.cancellation.description.lang" will always have the value "EN". The response schema allows for multiple values and does not enforce the specific value "EN" for this property. Therefore, the invariant will not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a summary "getMultiHotelOffers".
- It accepts a query parameter "boardType" of type string.
- The response schema includes a field "data" which is an array of objects, each containing a field "self" of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter "boardType" should be a substring of the "self" field in the response data.

## Analysis
This invariant is false-positive. The reason is that the "self" field in the response data is of type string, and the input parameter "boardType" is also of type string. However, there is no guarantee that the "self" field will always contain the value of the "boardType" as a substring. The two fields are independent and may not have any direct relationship.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

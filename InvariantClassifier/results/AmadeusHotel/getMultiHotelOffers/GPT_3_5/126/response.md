## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a summary "getMultiHotelOffers".
- The response schema includes a property "data" which is an array of objects, and each object has a property "offers" which is an array of objects.
- The property "boardType" is a string with an enum of 17 values.

## Invariant
- The invariant is LENGTH(return.boardType)==9, which means that the length of the string value of "boardType" in the response should always be 9.

## Analysis
- The enum for "boardType" has 17 values, which means the length of the string can never be fixed at 9.
- Therefore, the invariant LENGTH(return.boardType)==9 is a false-positive.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API because the length of the "boardType" string cannot be fixed at 9 due to the enum having 17 values.

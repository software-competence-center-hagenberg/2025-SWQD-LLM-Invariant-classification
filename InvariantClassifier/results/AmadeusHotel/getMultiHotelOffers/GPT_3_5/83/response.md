The invariant size(input.hotelIds[]) >= size(return.price.taxes[])-1 is false-positive. The reason for this is that the size of input.hotelIds[] is related to the number of hotelIds provided in the request, while the size of return.price.taxes[] is related to the number of taxes returned in the response. These two sizes are not directly related, and there is no guarantee that the number of hotelIds will be greater than or equal to the number of taxes minus one. Therefore, this invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

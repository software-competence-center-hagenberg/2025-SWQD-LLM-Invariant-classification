The invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant compares the number of beds in a room with the size of the array of accepted payment methods. These two values are not directly related, and there is no inherent relationship between the number of beds in a room and the number of accepted payment methods. Therefore, this invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

The invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is comparing the number of nights for cancellation with the size of the credit cards array minus 1. However, there is no direct relationship between these two fields in the response body. The number of nights for cancellation and the size of the credit cards array are independent fields, and there is no guarantee that the number of nights for cancellation will be less than the size of the credit cards array minus 1 for every valid request on the API.

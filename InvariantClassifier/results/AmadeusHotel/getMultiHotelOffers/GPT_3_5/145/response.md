## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET operation with a summary "getMultiHotelOffers".
- The response schema includes a property "data" which is an array of hotel objects.
- Each hotel object has a property "hotelId" which is a string with a pattern constraint of 8 characters.

## Invariant
The invariant is LENGTH(return.hotel.hotelId)==8, which checks if the length of the hotelId in the response is always 8 characters.

## Analysis
The Swagger definition specifies that the hotelId should have a fixed length of 8 characters, and the invariant is checking for the same condition. Since the Swagger definition and the invariant align in terms of the length constraint on hotelId, the invariant is a true-positive.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive

The invariant holds true for every valid request on the API because the Swagger definition explicitly enforces the fixed length constraint on hotelId.

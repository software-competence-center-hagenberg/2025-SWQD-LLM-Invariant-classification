## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET method with a response schema that includes nested properties.
- The specific property of interest is "data.offers.policies.cancellation.amount".

## Invariant
- The invariant states that "return.policies.cancellation.amount" should be Numeric.

## Analysis
- The Swagger definition does not explicitly specify the data type for the "amount" property under "cancellation".
- Without an explicit data type, it is not guaranteed that the "amount" will always be numeric.
- It is possible for the API to return non-numeric values for the "amount" property, making the invariant false-positive.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

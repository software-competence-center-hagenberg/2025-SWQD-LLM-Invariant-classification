## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/shopping/hotel-offers" has a GET method with a response schema that includes nested properties.
- The property path to be evaluated is "data.offers.price.variations.average.base".

## Invariant
- The invariant states that "return.price.variations.average.base" is Numeric, indicating that the characters of the string variable are always numeric.

## Analysis
- The provided schema does not specify the type of the "base" property under "average" in the response schema.
- Without a specific type declaration, it cannot be guaranteed that the "base" property will always be numeric.

## Conclusion
- The invariant is a false-positive because the schema does not enforce the type of the "base" property to be numeric. Therefore, it will not hold for every valid request on the API.

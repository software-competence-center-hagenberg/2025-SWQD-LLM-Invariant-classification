paths:
  "/shopping/hotel-offers"
  get:
    summary: getMultiHotelOffers
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            data:
              type: array
              items:
                offers:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    price:
                      type: object
                      description: price information
                      properties:
                        variations:

                          description: Daily price variations and the average daily price (when available) is shown here
                          properties:
                            average:
                              type: object
                              description: Price valuation information
                              properties:

                                  type: string

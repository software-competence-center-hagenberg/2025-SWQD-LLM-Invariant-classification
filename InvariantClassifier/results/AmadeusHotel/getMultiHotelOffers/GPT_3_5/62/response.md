The invariant input.roomQuantity != size(return.price.taxes[]) is a false-positive for the given REST endpoint. The reason for this is that the size of return.price.taxes[] is not directly related to the input.roomQuantity. The number of taxes returned in the response does not necessarily have a direct correlation with the room quantity requested. Therefore, this invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

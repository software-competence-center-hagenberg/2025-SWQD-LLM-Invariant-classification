### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/shopping/hotel-offers' has a GET method with a parameter 'hotelIds' that is a mandatory array of strings.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with 'data.offers' containing 'policies.deposit.acceptedPayments.methods'.

### Invariant
- The invariant states that the size of 'hotelIds' array in the request should be greater than or equal to the size of 'acceptedPayments.methods' array in the response minus 1.

### Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive because there is no direct relationship between the size of 'hotelIds' array in the request and the size of 'acceptedPayments.methods' array in the response. The two arrays are unrelated and their sizes do not have a direct correlation.

### Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive

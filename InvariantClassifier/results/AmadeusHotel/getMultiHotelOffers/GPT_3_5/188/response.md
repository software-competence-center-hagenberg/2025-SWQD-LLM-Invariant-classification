The invariant checks if the size of the input.hotelIds array minus 1 is divisible by the size of the return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods array. The input.hotelIds array is a required parameter for the request, and the return.policies.guarantee.acceptedPayments.methods array is a field in the response body. The invariant type is daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.NumericInt$Divides, which represents the divides without remainder invariant between two long scalars. Given the structure of the request and response, the invariant is a false-positive.

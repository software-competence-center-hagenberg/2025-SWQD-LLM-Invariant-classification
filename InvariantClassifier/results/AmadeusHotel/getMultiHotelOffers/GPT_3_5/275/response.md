## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition contains a GET endpoint for retrieving hotel offers. The response schema includes a nested structure with properties such as 'data', 'offers', and 'policies'. The 'amount' field under 'deposit' is described as the deposit/prepay amount.

## Invariant
The invariant states that 'return.policies.deposit.amount' is Numeric, indicating that the 'amount' field under 'deposit' should always contain numeric characters.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'amount' field under 'deposit' is described as a string type. However, the invariant specifies that it should be Numeric, which is not consistent with the schema definition.

## Conclusion
The invariant 'return.policies.deposit.amount is Numeric' is a false-positive, as it does not hold for every valid request on the API. The 'amount' field is defined as a string in the schema, and it may contain non-numeric characters, making the invariant incorrect.

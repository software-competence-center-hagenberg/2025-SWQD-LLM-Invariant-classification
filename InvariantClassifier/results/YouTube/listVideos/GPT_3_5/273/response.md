## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at "/youtube/v3/videos" that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes a property "nextPageToken" of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant is LENGTH(return.nextPageToken)==6, which specifies that the length of the "nextPageToken" in the response must always be 6.

## Analysis
- The swagger definition does not explicitly specify a fixed length for the "nextPageToken".
- The length of the "nextPageToken" in the response is not constrained by the provided swagger definition.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is false-positive because the swagger definition does not enforce a fixed length for the "nextPageToken" in the response.

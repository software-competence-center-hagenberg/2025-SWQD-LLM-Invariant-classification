## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube video resources. The endpoint accepts a 'part' parameter in the query, which specifies a comma-separated list of video resource properties to include in the API response. The response body contains an 'items' array, and each item in the array includes a 'snippet' object, which in turn contains a 'thumbnails' object. Within 'thumbnails', there is a 'maxres' object, which includes a 'width' property.

## Invariant

The invariant 'return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.width > size(input.part[])' states that the width of the 'maxres' thumbnail in the response should be greater than the size of the 'part' parameter array in the request.

## Analysis

The invariant is false-positive. The 'width' property of the 'maxres' thumbnail in the response is a specific value in the API response, and it does not depend on the size of the 'part' parameter array in the request. Therefore, this invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion

Verdict: false-positive

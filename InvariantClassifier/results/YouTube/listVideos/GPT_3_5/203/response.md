Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' is a GET request that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- It takes a query parameter 'id' which is an array of video ids.
- The response schema includes a 'pageInfo' object with a 'resultsPerPage' field representing the number of results included in the API response.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage == size(input.id[])' checks if the number of results per page in the response is equal to the size of the 'id' array in the request.

Analysis:
- The invariant is true-positive because it ensures that the number of results per page in the response matches the number of video ids provided in the request.

Conclusion:
- Verdict: true-positive

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                recordingDetails:
                  type: object
                  description: Recording information associated with the video.
                  properties:
                    location:
                      type: object
                      description: Geographical coordinates of a point, in WGS84.
                      properties:
                        altitude:
                          type: number
                          description: Altitude above the reference ellipsoid, in meters.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.recordingDetails.location.altitude == 0.0

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.OneOfFloat
Invariant description: Represents double variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

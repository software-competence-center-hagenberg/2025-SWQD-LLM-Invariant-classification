The invariant compares the height of the default thumbnail with the size of the tags array in the response. It assumes that for every valid request to the API, the height of the default thumbnail will always be greater than the size of the tags array. This assumption may not hold true for all valid requests to the API, as there could be videos with no default thumbnail or with a very large number of tags. Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of resources from the path "/youtube/v3/videos".
- The response schema includes a field "items" which contains an array of objects, each with a "statistics" field.
- The "statistics" field is an object with a property "viewCount" of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant states that "return.statistics.viewCount" is Numeric, indicating that the characters of the string variable are always numeric.

## Analysis
The Swagger definition does not specify that the "viewCount" property must always contain numeric characters. In fact, the type is defined as a string, which allows for non-numeric characters as well. Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive
The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, as the Swagger definition allows the "viewCount" property to contain non-numeric characters.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources. The endpoint accepts a query parameter 'maxHeight' of type integer, and the response body includes a 'snippet' object with a 'thumbnails' object containing a 'maxres' object with a 'width' property.

## Invariant

The invariant states that the input 'maxHeight' should not be equal to the return 'snippet.thumbnails.maxres.width'.

## Analysis

The invariant is false-positive. The 'maxHeight' parameter and the 'width' property are unrelated in the context of the API. The 'maxHeight' parameter is used for filtering the resources based on the maximum height, while the 'width' property is a property of the thumbnail image. There is no direct relationship between these two values, and they serve different purposes within the API.

## Conclusion

The invariant is a false-positive as there is no logical connection between the 'maxHeight' parameter and the 'width' property in the context of the API.

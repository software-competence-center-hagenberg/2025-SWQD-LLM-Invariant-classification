The invariant states that the 'id' field in the response should be a substring of the 'url' field in the 'medium' object within the 'thumbnails' object within the 'snippet' object. This implies that the 'id' of the video should be a part of the URL of the medium thumbnail. The verdict on the invariant will depend on whether this relationship holds for every valid request on the API.

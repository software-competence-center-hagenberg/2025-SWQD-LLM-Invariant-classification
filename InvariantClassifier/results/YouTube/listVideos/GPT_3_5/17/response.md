## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response schema includes a field 'contentDetails' which contains a field 'dimension' indicating whether the video is available in 3D or in 2D.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.contentDetails.dimension one of { "2d", "3d" }' checks if the 'dimension' field in the response is one of the values '2d' or '3d'.

## Analysis
Given the response schema, the invariant holds true for every valid response to the endpoint. The 'dimension' field is explicitly defined as a string with the possible values '2d' or '3d', and there are no other possible values.

## Conclusion
The invariant 'return.contentDetails.dimension one of { "2d", "3d" }' is a true-positive and holds for every valid response to the endpoint.

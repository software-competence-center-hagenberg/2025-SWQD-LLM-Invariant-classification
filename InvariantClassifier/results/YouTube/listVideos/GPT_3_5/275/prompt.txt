Invariant: "return.recordingDetails.locationDescription one of { ""Civil Guruji Private Limited"", ""San Diego"", ""Ukraine"" }"

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.OneOfString
Invariant description: Represents String variables that take on only a few distinct values. Prints as either x == c (when there is only one value) or as x one of {c1, c2, c3} (when there are multiple values).

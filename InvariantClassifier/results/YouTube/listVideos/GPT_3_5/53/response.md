The invariant size(return.snippet.tags[]) >= 1 is a true-positive. This is because the invariant ensures that the 'tags' array in the response body has at least one element. According to the Swagger definition, the 'tags' array is described as 'A list of keyword tags associated with the video', and it makes sense for a video to have at least one associated tag. Therefore, this invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

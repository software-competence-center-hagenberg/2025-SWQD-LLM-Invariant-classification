The given invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that both 'return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]' and 'return.snippet.tags[]' will always have the same size. However, this assumption may not hold true for all valid requests to the API. The size of 'return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]' and 'return.snippet.tags[]' may not be directly related, and there may be valid scenarios where their sizes are not equal. Therefore, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

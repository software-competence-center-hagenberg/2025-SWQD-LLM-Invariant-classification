Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET method with a parameter 'maxWidth' in the query.
- The response schema includes a 'snippet' object with a 'thumbnails' object containing a 'standard' object with a 'width' property.

Invariant:
- input.maxWidth > return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width

Analysis:
- The invariant compares the 'maxWidth' parameter in the request with the 'width' property in the response.
- The invariant is true-positive because it ensures that the 'maxWidth' parameter is greater than the 'width' property in the response, which is a valid condition for filtering videos based on width.

Conclusion:
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the nature of the invariant, it is classified as a true-positive invariant.

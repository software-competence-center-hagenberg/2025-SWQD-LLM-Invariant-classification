## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a snippet object with a categoryId field of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that return.snippet.categoryId is Numeric, indicating that the categoryId field in the response should always contain numeric characters.

## Analysis
- The Swagger definition does not specify any constraint on the format of the categoryId field. It is defined as a string without any specific format requirements.
- Therefore, the invariant return.snippet.categoryId is Numeric is a false-positive because the categoryId field is defined as a string and can contain non-numeric characters.

## Conclusion
Based on the Swagger definition, the invariant return.snippet.categoryId is Numeric is a false-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET method for retrieving a list of resources.
- The response schema includes a property "pageInfo" which contains a property "resultsPerPage" of type integer.

## Invariant
- The invariant is "return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 1", which specifies that the number of results per page in the API response must be greater than or equal to 1.

## Analysis
- The invariant specifies a lower bound on the number of results per page, ensuring that the API response includes at least one result per page.
- Given the description of the endpoint and the response schema, it is reasonable to expect that the number of results per page should be greater than or equal to 1.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a true-positive as it holds for every valid request on the API.

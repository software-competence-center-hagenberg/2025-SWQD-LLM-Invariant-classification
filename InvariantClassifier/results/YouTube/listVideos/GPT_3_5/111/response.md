The invariant return.snippet.defaultLanguage in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[] checks if the default language of a video is included in the list of allowed region codes for the video. The Swagger definition provided does not include the complete structure of the response body, so it's not possible to determine if this invariant holds for every valid request on the API. Without the complete response body structure, it's not possible to verify if the defaultLanguage field is always a member of the allowed region codes.

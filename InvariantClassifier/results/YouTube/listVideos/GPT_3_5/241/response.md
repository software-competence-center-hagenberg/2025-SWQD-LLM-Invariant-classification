The invariant is a true-positive. The Swagger definition specifies that the 'scheduledStartTime' field is of type 'string' and describes it as 'The time that the broadcast is scheduled to begin.' The invariant checks for the format of the string to be in the format 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmZ', which aligns with the description provided in the Swagger definition. Since the Swagger definition enforces the format of the 'scheduledStartTime' field as a string, the invariant holds true for every valid request on the API.

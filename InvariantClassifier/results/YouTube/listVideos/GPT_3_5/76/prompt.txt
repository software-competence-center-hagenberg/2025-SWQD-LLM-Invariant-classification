Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
      - name: maxResults
        in: query
        description: The *maxResults* parameter specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the result set. *Note:* This parameter is supported for use in conjunction with the myRating and chart parameters, but it is not supported for use in conjunction with the id parameter.
        required: false
        type: integer
        minimum: 1
        maxLength: 50
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                snippet:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video, including title, description, uploader, thumbnails and category.
                  properties:
                    thumbnails:
                      type: object
                      description: Internal representation of thumbnails for a YouTube resource.
                      properties:
                        high:
                          type: object
                          description: A thumbnail is an image representing a YouTube resource.
                          properties:
                            width:
                              type: integer
                              description: (Optional) Width of the thumbnail image.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.maxResults < return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntLessThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of < between two long scalars. Prints as x < y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

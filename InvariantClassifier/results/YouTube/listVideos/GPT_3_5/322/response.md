## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The endpoint accepts a 'maxResults' query parameter, which specifies the maximum number of items to be returned in the result set. The response schema includes a 'contentDetails' object, which contains a 'regionRestriction' object with a 'blocked' array.

## Invariant

The invariant states that the 'maxResults' parameter in the request should not be equal to the size of the 'blocked' array in the response.

## Analysis

The invariant is false-positive. The 'maxResults' parameter in the request and the size of the 'blocked' array in the response are unrelated. The number of items to be returned in the result set does not depend on the region restrictions of the videos. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion

Verdict: false-positive

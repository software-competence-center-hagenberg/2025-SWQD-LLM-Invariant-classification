## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition contains a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response schema includes 'contentDetails' and 'snippet' properties, each containing nested objects with specific properties.

## Invariant

The invariant states that the size of the 'regionRestriction.blocked' array in 'contentDetails' should not be equal to the size of the 'tags' array in 'snippet'.

## Analysis

The invariant is false-positive. This is because the invariant assumes a specific relationship between the sizes of two arrays in the response, but it does not consider the variability of the response data. The sizes of these arrays can be independent of each other and may not have any fixed relationship. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion

Verdict: false-positive

The invariant is not correct for every valid request on the API as it assumes a relationship between array sizes that may not exist in the actual response data.

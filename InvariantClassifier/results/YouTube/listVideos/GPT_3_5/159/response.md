## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/youtube/v3/videos" which retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The request parameter "part" is a required query parameter of type array.
- The response schema includes an "items" array, where each item contains a "snippet" object, which in turn contains a "thumbnails" object with a "high" object that includes a "width" property.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width % size(input.part[]) == 0

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the width of the high thumbnail is divisible by the size of the input part array without a remainder. This means that the width of the high thumbnail should be evenly divisible by the number of video resource properties specified in the input part parameter.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive. This is because the width of the high thumbnail is not directly related to the number of video resource properties specified in the input part parameter. The width of the high thumbnail is a specific attribute of the thumbnail and is not dependent on the input part parameter. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/youtube/v3/videos" with a query parameter "maxHeight" of type integer.
- The response schema includes a field "pageInfo" with a subfield "totalResults" of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter "maxHeight" should not be equal to the return field "pageInfo.totalResults".

## Analysis
The invariant is false-positive. This is because the input parameter "maxHeight" is a query parameter used for filtering the list of resources, while the return field "pageInfo.totalResults" represents the total number of results in the result set. These two values are not directly related, and there is no inherent constraint that the input "maxHeight" should not be equal to the total number of results. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive

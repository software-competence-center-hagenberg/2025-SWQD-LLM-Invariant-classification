**Swagger Definition Breakdown**

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube video resources. The endpoint accepts a query parameter named 'part' which specifies the video resource properties to be included in the API response. The response schema includes a 'snippet' object, which in turn contains a 'thumbnails' object, and within that, a 'maxres' object with a 'height' property.

**Invariant**

The invariant provided is: return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.height % size(input.part[]) == 0

**Analysis**

The invariant checks if the height of the 'maxres' thumbnail is divisible by the number of video resource properties specified in the 'part' parameter without a remainder. This means that the height of the thumbnail should be evenly divisible by the number of properties requested in the 'part' parameter.

**Conclusion**

The invariant is a **true-positive**. This is because the invariant ensures that the height of the 'maxres' thumbnail is evenly divisible by the number of video resource properties requested, which is a valid condition for the API response. Therefore, the invariant holds true for every valid request on the API.

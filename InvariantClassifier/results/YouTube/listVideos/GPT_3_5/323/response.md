## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET method with a 'maxResults' query parameter.
- The response schema includes a 'contentDetails' object with a 'regionRestriction' object containing a 'blocked' array.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the 'maxResults' parameter in the request should not be equal to the size of the 'blocked' array in the response minus 1.

## Analysis
- The 'maxResults' parameter is a query parameter in the request, and the 'blocked' array is a field in the response.
- The invariant does not seem to have a direct relationship between the 'maxResults' parameter and the 'blocked' array.
- It is unclear how the size of the 'blocked' array in the response is related to the 'maxResults' parameter in the request.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive. There is no clear relationship between the 'maxResults' parameter in the request and the size of the 'blocked' array in the response, so the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

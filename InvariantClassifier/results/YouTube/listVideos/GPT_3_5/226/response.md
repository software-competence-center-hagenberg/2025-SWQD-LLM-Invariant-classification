The invariant 'return.pageInfo.totalResults >= size(return.items[])' states that the total number of results in the response should be greater than or equal to the number of items returned in the response. This invariant is true-positive for the given REST endpoint because it ensures that the total number of results is at least as large as the number of items returned. This holds true for every valid request on the API, as the total number of results should always be greater than or equal to the number of items returned.

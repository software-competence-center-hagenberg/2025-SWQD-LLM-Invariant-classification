The invariant compares the height of the default thumbnail with the size of the tags array in the response. It checks if they are not equal. The Swagger definition does not guarantee that the 'default' object within 'thumbnails' will always have a 'height' property, and it does not specify any constraints on the 'tags' array. Therefore, this invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

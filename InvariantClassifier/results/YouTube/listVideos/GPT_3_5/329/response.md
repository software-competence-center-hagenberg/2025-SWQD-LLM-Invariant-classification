## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The endpoint accepts a query parameter 'maxWidth' and returns a list of video resources with details including thumbnails.

## Invariant

The invariant states that the 'maxWidth' in the request input should not be equal to the width of the medium thumbnail in the response.

## Analysis

The invariant is false-positive. The reason is that the 'maxWidth' parameter in the request does not have a direct relationship with the width of the medium thumbnail in the response. The 'maxWidth' parameter is used to filter the videos based on the player width, while the width of the medium thumbnail is a property of the thumbnail itself. These two values are not directly related, and there is no guarantee that they should be unequal.

## Conclusion

Verdict: false-positive

The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, as there is no inherent relationship between the 'maxWidth' parameter and the width of the medium thumbnail in the response.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources. The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a snippet and topicDetails object. The snippet object contains a thumbnails object, which in turn contains a high object with a width property. The topicDetails object contains a topicCategories array.

## Invariant

The invariant is a numeric divides invariant that checks if the width of the high thumbnail is divisible by the size of the topicCategories array without remainder.

## Analysis

The invariant is false-positive. This is because the width of the high thumbnail and the size of the topicCategories array are independent properties within the response. There is no inherent relationship or dependency between these two properties that would guarantee the width to be divisible by the size of the topicCategories array.

## Conclusion

The invariant is false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

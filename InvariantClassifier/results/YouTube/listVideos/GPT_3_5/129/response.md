The invariant return.liveStreamingDetails.actualStartTime in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[] is false-positive. This is because the 'blocked' field is an array of region codes, and 'actualStartTime' is a string representing the time that the broadcast actually started. These two fields are not related in a way that would make the invariant hold true for every valid request on the API.

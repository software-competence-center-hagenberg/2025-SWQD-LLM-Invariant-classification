## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a snippet with thumbnails and tags.

## Invariant
- The invariant is comparing the width of the maxres thumbnail with the size of the tags array.
- Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan

## Analysis
- The invariant is checking if the width of the maxres thumbnail is greater than the size of the tags array.
- However, the response schema does not guarantee that every item in the array will have a maxres thumbnail, and the tags array may be empty for some videos.
- Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive because it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive

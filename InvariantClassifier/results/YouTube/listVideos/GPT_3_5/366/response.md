## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The Swagger definition includes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of resources from "/youtube/v3/videos".
- The endpoint has a query parameter named "maxWidth" which is an integer with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192.
- The response schema includes a property "pageInfo" with a sub-property "totalResults" of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter "maxWidth" should not be equal to the total number of results returned in the response ("pageInfo.totalResults").

## Analysis
The invariant is false-positive. This is because the width of the player ("maxWidth") and the total number of results ("pageInfo.totalResults") are unrelated properties. There is no logical connection between the width of the player and the total number of results in the response. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive

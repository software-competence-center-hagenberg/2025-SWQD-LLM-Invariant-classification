## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos.
- The response schema includes a property 'contentDetails' which contains a property 'definition' with an enum of ['sd', 'hd'].

## Invariant
- The invariant LENGTH(return.contentDetails.definition)==2 checks if the length of the 'definition' string in the response is always 2.

## Analysis
- The 'definition' property is defined as an enum with two values: 'sd' and 'hd'. This means that the length of the 'definition' string will always be 2, as it can only take two specific values.

## Conclusion
- The invariant LENGTH(return.contentDetails.definition)==2 is a true-positive. The length of the 'definition' string will always be 2 due to the enum constraint in the response schema.

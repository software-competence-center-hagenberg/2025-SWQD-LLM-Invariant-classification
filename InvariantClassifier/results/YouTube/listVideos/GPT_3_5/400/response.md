## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response schema includes a property 'items' which contains an array of video items. Each video item has a property 'liveStreamingDetails' which includes 'scheduledEndTime' indicating the time that the broadcast is scheduled to end.

## Invariant

The invariant is checking if the length of 'scheduledEndTime' in the response is always 20 characters.

## Analysis

The provided Swagger definition does not specify a fixed length for the 'scheduledEndTime' property. Therefore, the invariant LENGTH(return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime)==20 is a false-positive. There is no guarantee that the 'scheduledEndTime' will always have a fixed length of 20 characters for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion

The invariant is a false-positive.

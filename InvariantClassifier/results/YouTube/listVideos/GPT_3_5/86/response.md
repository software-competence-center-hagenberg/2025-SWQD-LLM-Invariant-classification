## Swagger Definition Breakdown

- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET method with a parameter 'maxWidth' in the query.
- The response schema includes a 'snippet' object with a 'thumbnails' object inside it, which contains a 'default' object with a 'width' property.

## Invariant

- The invariant states that 'input.maxWidth' should be greater than 'return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width'.

## Analysis

- The 'maxWidth' parameter is part of the request, and 'snippet.thumbnails.default.width' is part of the response.
- The invariant checks if the requested 'maxWidth' is greater than the width of the default thumbnail in the response.
- This invariant is true-positive because it ensures that the requested maximum width is greater than the width of the default thumbnail, which is a valid condition for filtering and displaying thumbnails.

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the invariant is true-positive.

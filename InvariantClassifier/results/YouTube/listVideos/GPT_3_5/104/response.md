The invariant return.player.embedWidth in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[] checks if the embedWidth of the player is present in the list of allowed region codes for the video. The Swagger definition provided does not include the necessary information to validate this invariant. The schema does not specify the structure of the 'player' object or the 'regionRestriction' object within the 'contentDetails' object. Without this information, it is not possible to determine if the invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

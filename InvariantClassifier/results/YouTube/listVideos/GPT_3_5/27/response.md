## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET method for retrieving a list of resources.
- The response schema includes a property "items" which contains an array of resources.
- Each item in the array has a property "processingDetails" which is an object containing a property "processingProgress".

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the field "processingProgress" in the response is equal to null.

## Analysis
The invariant is checking a specific field in the response body and does not depend on any request parameters or request body fields. It is a unary scalar invariant that checks if a specific field in the response has a specific value (null in this case).

## Conclusion
The invariant is a true-positive. It holds for every valid request on the API because it checks a specific field in the response body and does not depend on any request parameters or request body fields.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` has a GET operation with a parameter `maxWidth` in the query.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with `contentDetails` and `regionRestriction`.
- The `regionRestriction` object contains an `allowed` field which is an array of strings.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxWidth > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[])

## Analysis
The invariant compares the value of `maxWidth` in the request with the size of the `allowed` array in the response. It checks if the `maxWidth` is greater than the number of allowed regions for the video.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive. This is because the `maxWidth` parameter in the request and the `allowed` array in the response are unrelated. The `maxWidth` parameter is related to the width of the player, while the `allowed` array is related to region restrictions. There is no direct relationship between these two fields, so the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

The invariant input.maxWidth > return.snippet.thumbnails.high.height is false-positive. This is because the 'maxWidth' parameter in the request and the 'height' field in the response are not directly related. The 'maxWidth' parameter specifies the maximum width of the player, while the 'height' field in the response refers to the height of a thumbnail image. There is no direct relationship between these two fields, and the comparison input.maxWidth > return.snippet.thumbnails.high.height does not hold for every valid request on the API.

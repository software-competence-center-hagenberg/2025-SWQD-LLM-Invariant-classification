## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The operation takes a query parameter "id" which is an array of video ids.
- The response schema includes a field "items" which contains an array of videos, each with a "snippet" object containing a "thumbnails" object with a "standard" object containing a "width" field.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width > size(input.id[])
This means that the width of the standard thumbnail for a video should be greater than the number of video ids provided in the request.

## Analysis
The invariant is false-positive. The width of the standard thumbnail for a video is not related to the number of video ids provided in the request. The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive

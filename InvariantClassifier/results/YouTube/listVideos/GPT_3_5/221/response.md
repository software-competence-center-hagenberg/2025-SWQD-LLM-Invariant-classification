### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET method with a 'maxWidth' query parameter.
- The response schema includes a 'pageInfo' object with a 'totalResults' field.

### Invariant
- The invariant states that 'input.maxWidth' should be greater than 'return.pageInfo.totalResults'.

### Analysis
- The 'maxWidth' parameter is a query parameter that represents the maximum width of the player.
- The 'totalResults' field in the response schema represents the total number of results in the result set.
- It is unlikely that the maximum width of the player would have a direct relationship with the total number of results in the response.
- Therefore, the invariant 'input.maxWidth > return.pageInfo.totalResults' is a false-positive.

### Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive

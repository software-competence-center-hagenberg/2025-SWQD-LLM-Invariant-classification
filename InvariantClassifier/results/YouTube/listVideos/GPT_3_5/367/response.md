## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/youtube/v3/videos" with a query parameter "id" that is an array.
- The response schema includes a field "pageInfo.resultsPerPage" which is an integer representing the number of results included in the API response.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that "return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage <= size(input.id[])" where "size(input.id[])" represents the size of the array of ids in the request.

## Analysis
- The invariant checks if the number of results per page in the response is less than or equal to the size of the array of ids in the request.
- This invariant assumes that the number of results per page is related to the size of the array of ids, which may not be the case in all scenarios.
- It does not consider other factors that may affect the number of results per page, such as pagination limits or server-side configurations.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive because it does not hold for every valid request on the API. The number of results per page is not directly related to the size of the array of ids in the request, and there are other factors that can affect the number of results per page.

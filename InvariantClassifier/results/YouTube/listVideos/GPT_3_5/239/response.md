## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources.
- The response schema includes a property "liveStreamingDetails" with a sub-property "actualStartTime" of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant specifies that "return.liveStreamingDetails.actualStartTime" should be a timestamp with the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmZ (milliseconds are optional).

## Analysis
- The Swagger definition does not explicitly specify the format of the "actualStartTime" property.
- Without explicit format validation in the Swagger definition, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive as it cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

The invariant return.suggestions.editorSuggestions == null is checking if the editorSuggestions field within the suggestions object is null. This means that the API is expected to return a response where the editorSuggestions field is null. The Swagger definition does not specify that the editorSuggestions field is optional or nullable, so this invariant is a false-positive.

The given invariant checks if the height of the medium thumbnail is divisible by the size of the blocked region array. This invariant is false-positive because there is no direct relationship between the height of a thumbnail and the size of the blocked region array. The two properties are unrelated, and there is no guarantee that the height of the medium thumbnail will be divisible by the size of the blocked region array for every valid request on the API.

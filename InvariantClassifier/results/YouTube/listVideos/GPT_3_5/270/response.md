**Swagger Definition Breakdown**

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of resources from the YouTube API. The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a player object and a status object. The player object has a property embedHtml of type string, and the status object has a property license of type string.

**Invariant**

The invariant specifies that the value of return.status.license should be a substring of the value of return.player.embedHtml.

**Analysis**

Based on the provided Swagger definition, the invariant is false-positive. There is no direct relationship or dependency between the status object's license property and the player object's embedHtml property. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

**Conclusion**

Verdict: false-positive

The invariant return.status.license is a substring of return.player.embedHtml does not hold for every valid request on the API as there is no specified relationship between these two properties in the response schema.

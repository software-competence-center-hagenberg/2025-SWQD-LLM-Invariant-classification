The given invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the 'return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width' and 'return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]' are not directly related in the Swagger definition. The 'return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width' is a property of the 'snippet' object within the 'items' array, while 'return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]' is a property of the 'contentDetails' object within the 'items' array. There is no direct relationship between these two properties in the response structure, and therefore the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

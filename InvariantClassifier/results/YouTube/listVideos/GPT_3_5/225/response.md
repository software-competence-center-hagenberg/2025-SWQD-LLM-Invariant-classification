## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/youtube/v3/videos" with a query parameter "part"
- The response contains a field "pageInfo" with a property "totalResults"

## Invariant
The invariant states that the total number of results in the response should not be equal to the size of the input parameter "part" array minus 1.

## Analysis
The invariant is false-positive. The size of the input parameter "part" array does not directly correlate with the total number of results in the response. The total number of results in the response is independent of the size of the input parameter "part" array, and there is no direct relationship between the two.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive

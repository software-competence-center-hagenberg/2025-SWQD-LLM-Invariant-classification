Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources.
- The response schema includes a property 'items' which contains 'liveStreamingDetails' with a property 'actualEndTime' of type string.

Invariant:
- The invariant specifies that 'return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime' should be a timestamp with the format 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmZ'.

Analysis:
- The Swagger definition does not explicitly specify the format of the 'actualEndTime' property.
- Without explicit format specification in the Swagger definition, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

Conclusion:
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive because it cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API due to the lack of explicit format specification in the Swagger definition.

The invariant return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width == 480 is a false-positive. This is because the Swagger definition does not guarantee that the 'width' field under 'high' in the 'thumbnails' object will always be 480. The description of the 'width' field also indicates that it is optional, meaning it may not always be present. Therefore, this invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

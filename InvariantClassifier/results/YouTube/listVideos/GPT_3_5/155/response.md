The given invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant compares 'return.snippet.thumbnails.high.height' with 'size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])'. However, the 'size' function returns the number of elements in the array 'return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]', and it does not compare with the 'height' property of the thumbnail. Therefore, this invariant is not correct for every valid request on the API.

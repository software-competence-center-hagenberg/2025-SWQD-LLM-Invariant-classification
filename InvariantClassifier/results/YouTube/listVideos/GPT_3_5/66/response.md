## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET method with a description to retrieve a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- It has a query parameter named "maxHeight" of type integer, with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a "snippet" object with a "thumbnails" object, which in turn contains a "medium" object with a "height" property of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxHeight > return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.height

## Analysis
The invariant compares the query parameter "maxHeight" with the height of the medium thumbnail in the response. This comparison ensures that the requested maximum height is greater than the height of the medium thumbnail of the returned videos.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a true-positive. It holds for every valid request on the API, ensuring that the requested maximum height is greater than the height of the medium thumbnail in the response.

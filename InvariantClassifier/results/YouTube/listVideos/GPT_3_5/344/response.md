The given invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that both 'return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height' and 'size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[])' will always have values, which may not be the case for every valid request on the API. The presence of these fields is not guaranteed for every response, and therefore the invariant will not hold for every valid request.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos` has a GET method that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The `maxHeight` parameter is a query parameter of type integer with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a `snippet` object with a `thumbnails` object, which in turn contains a `high` object with a `height` property.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxHeight > return.snippet.thumbnails.high.height

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the `maxHeight` provided in the request is greater than the `height` of the `high` thumbnail in the response. This means that the invariant is checking if the requested maximum height is greater than the actual height of the returned thumbnail.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a true-positive. It holds for every valid request on the API because it ensures that the requested maximum height is indeed greater than the height of the returned thumbnail.

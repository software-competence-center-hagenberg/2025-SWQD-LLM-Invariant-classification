## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources.
- The response schema includes a property "liveStreamingDetails" with a sub-property "actualEndTime" of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant is LENGTH(return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime)==20
- It specifies that the length of the string value in the response's "liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime" field should always be 20.

## Analysis
- The Swagger definition does not provide any constraints on the length of the "actualEndTime" string.
- There is no indication in the definition that the length of the string is fixed at 20 characters.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive because the Swagger definition does not enforce a fixed length of 20 characters for the "actualEndTime" string in the response.

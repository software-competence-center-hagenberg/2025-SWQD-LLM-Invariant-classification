The invariant return.snippet.liveBroadcastContent in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[] checks if the live broadcast content of a video is allowed in the region restriction. This means that the live broadcast content should be included in the list of allowed region codes. The Swagger definition provided does not contain enough information to verify this invariant. The presence of the region restriction and allowed region codes is not guaranteed for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition contains a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response schema includes an array of items, each of which contains contentDetails and liveStreamingDetails.

## Invariant

The invariant states that return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime should be in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]. This means that the scheduled end time of a live stream should be in the list of blocked region codes.

## Analysis

The scheduled end time is a property of live streaming details, while the region restriction is a property of content details. Therefore, the invariant is false-positive.

## Conclusion

The invariant is false-positive as there is no logical connection between the scheduled end time of a live stream and the region restriction of the video in the given API definition.

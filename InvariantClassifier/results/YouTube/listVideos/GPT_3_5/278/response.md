## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation with a parameter named "maxResults" in the query.
- The response schema includes a field "topicDetails" which contains a field "topicCategories".

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the input parameter "maxResults" should not be equal to the size of the array "topicCategories" in the response.

## Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive. The size of the array "topicCategories" in the response is not directly related to the input parameter "maxResults". The size of the array depends on the data and is not constrained by the input parameter.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

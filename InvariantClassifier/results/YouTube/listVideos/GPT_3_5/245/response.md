Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'recordingDate' field is defined as a string type, and the format is not explicitly specified in the Swagger definition. Therefore, the invariant is false-positive as it cannot be guaranteed that 'recordingDate' will always be in the specified timestamp format.

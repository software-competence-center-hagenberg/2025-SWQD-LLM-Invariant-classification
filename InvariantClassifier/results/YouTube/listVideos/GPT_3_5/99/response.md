The invariant return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[] is false-positive. This is because the actualEndTime and regionRestriction.allowed[] are not related in the Swagger definition. The actualEndTime is a property of liveStreamingDetails, while regionRestriction.allowed[] is a property of contentDetails. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

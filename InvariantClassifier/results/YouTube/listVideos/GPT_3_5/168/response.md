The invariant checks if the height of the maxres thumbnail is divisible by the size of the topicCategories array. This invariant is false-positive because it assumes a specific relationship between two unrelated fields in the response body. There is no inherent connection between the height of a thumbnail and the size of the topicCategories array, and this relationship cannot be guaranteed for every valid request on the API.

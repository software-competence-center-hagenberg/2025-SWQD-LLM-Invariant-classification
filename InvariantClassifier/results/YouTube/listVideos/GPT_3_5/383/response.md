The invariant return.contentDetails.contentRating.ytRating in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[] checks if the value of ytRating is present in the list of allowed region codes. This invariant is a false-positive because the 'regionRestriction' field is marked as 'DEPRECATED' in the Swagger definition. This means that the 'regionRestriction' field may not be present in the response, and therefore the invariant will not hold for every valid request on the API.

The invariant return.status.privacyStatus in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[] checks if the privacy status of a video is in the list of blocked regions. This invariant is false-positive because the 'regionRestriction' object is an optional field, and it may not be present in every response. Therefore, the invariant will not hold for every valid request on the API.

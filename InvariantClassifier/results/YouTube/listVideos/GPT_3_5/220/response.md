## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation with a query parameter named "maxWidth".
- The response schema includes a field "pageInfo.resultsPerPage" that represents the number of results included in the API response.

## Invariant
- input.maxWidth > return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage

## Analysis
- The invariant compares the query parameter "maxWidth" with the number of results in the API response ("pageInfo.resultsPerPage").
- The Swagger definition does not specify any constraints or relationships between the query parameter "maxWidth" and the response field "pageInfo.resultsPerPage".
- Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive because it assumes a relationship that is not defined in the Swagger definition.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive

The invariant input.maxWidth != return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width is a false-positive. The Swagger definition does not guarantee that the 'high' object within 'thumbnails' will always have a 'width' property. The 'high' object is described as an 'object' with no required properties, which means it may or may not have a 'width' property. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

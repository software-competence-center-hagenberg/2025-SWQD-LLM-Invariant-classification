## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition contains a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources. The response schema includes 'items' which contains 'snippet' and 'contentDetails' objects.

## Invariant

The invariant states that the width of the default thumbnail in the response should not be equal to the size of the array of blocked region codes in the contentDetails object.

## Analysis

The invariant is false-positive. This is because the 'return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width' and 'return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]' are not directly related in the response schema. The width of the default thumbnail and the size of the blocked region codes array are independent properties and there is no direct relationship between them that would make this invariant hold true for every valid request.

## Conclusion

Verdict: false-positive

The invariant does not hold true for every valid request on the API as the properties being compared are not directly related in the response schema.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The endpoint accepts a query parameter 'maxHeight' of type integer, which is not required. The response schema includes a 'snippet' object within the 'items' array, and this 'snippet' object contains a 'tags' array of strings.

## Invariant

The invariant states that 'input.maxHeight' should be greater than the size of the 'return.snippet.tags[]' array.

## Analysis

The invariant is false-positive. The 'maxHeight' parameter is a query parameter that does not directly relate to the 'snippet.tags' array in the response. The size of the 'snippet.tags' array is not dependent on the 'maxHeight' parameter, and there is no direct relationship between the two. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion

Verdict: false-positive

The invariant is not correct for the given REST API as it does not hold for every valid request.

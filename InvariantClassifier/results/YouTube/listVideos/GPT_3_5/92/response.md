## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources. The endpoint accepts a query parameter 'maxWidth' and returns a list of resources with details including thumbnails.

## Invariant

The invariant states that 'input.maxWidth' should be greater than 'return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.width'. This means that the maximum width specified in the request should be greater than the width of the medium thumbnail in the response.

## Analysis

Based on the Swagger definition, the 'maxWidth' parameter is optional and of type integer with a minimum value of 72. The response schema includes a 'thumbnails' object with a 'medium' object containing a 'width' property, representing the width of the medium thumbnail.

Given the definition, the invariant is a false-positive. The 'maxWidth' parameter is optional, and there is no guarantee that it will always be provided in the request. Therefore, the comparison 'input.maxWidth > return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.width' will not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion

The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

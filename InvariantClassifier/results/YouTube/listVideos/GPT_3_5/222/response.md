The invariant 'input.maxWidth > size(return.items[])' checks if the value of 'maxWidth' in the request is greater than the number of items in the response. Given the Swagger definition, the 'maxWidth' parameter is a query parameter in the request, and 'items' is a field in the response schema. Since the 'maxWidth' parameter is not directly related to the number of items in the response, this invariant is a false-positive. The 'maxWidth' parameter is related to the player width, and it is not directly linked to the number of items in the response. Therefore, this invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

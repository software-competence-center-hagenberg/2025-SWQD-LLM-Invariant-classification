The given invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that the response will always contain 'contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked' and 'topicDetails.topicCategories'. However, the Swagger definition does not guarantee that these fields will always be present in the response. Therefore, the invariant cannot hold for every valid request on the API.

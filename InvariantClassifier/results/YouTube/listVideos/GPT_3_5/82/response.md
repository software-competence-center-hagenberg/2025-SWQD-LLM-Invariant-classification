The invariant input.maxResults < return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width is false-positive. The reason for this is that the maxResults parameter specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the result set, and it is not directly related to the width of the thumbnails. The width of the thumbnails is a property of the returned video items, and it is not directly related to the maxResults parameter. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

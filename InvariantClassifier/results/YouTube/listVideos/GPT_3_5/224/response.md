The invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant assumes a specific relationship between the 'pageInfo.resultsPerPage' and the size of 'items' in the response. However, the swagger definition does not enforce this relationship. The 'pageInfo.resultsPerPage' is just a metadata field that provides information about the number of results included in the API response, and it does not necessarily have a direct relationship with the actual size of 'items' in the response. Therefore, the invariant 'return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= size(return.items[])' cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

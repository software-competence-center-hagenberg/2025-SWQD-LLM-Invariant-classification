### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The endpoint accepts a 'maxResults' query parameter, which specifies the maximum number of items to be returned in the result set. The response body contains a 'contentDetails' object, which includes a 'regionRestriction' object with a 'blocked' array.

### Invariant

The invariant states that the value of 'maxResults' in the request should be greater than the size of the 'blocked' array in the response.

### Analysis

The invariant is false-positive. The 'maxResults' parameter in the request specifies the maximum number of items to be returned, while the 'blocked' array in the response represents the list of region codes where the video is blocked. These two values are not directly related, and there is no inherent relationship between the number of items to be returned and the number of blocked regions. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

### Conclusion

Verdict: false-positive

The invariant is not correct for every valid request on the API as there is no direct relationship between 'maxResults' and the size of the 'blocked' array in the response.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources. The endpoint accepts a query parameter 'maxWidth' and returns a list of resources with details including thumbnails.

## Invariant

The invariant states that the 'maxWidth' in the request should not be equal to the 'height' of the default thumbnail in the response.

## Analysis

The invariant is false-positive. The 'maxWidth' parameter in the request is related to the width of the player, while the 'height' of the default thumbnail in the response is related to the height of the thumbnail image. These two values are not directly related, and there is no inherent constraint that the 'maxWidth' should not be equal to the 'height' of the default thumbnail.

## Conclusion

Verdict: false-positive

The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API as there is no logical relationship between the 'maxWidth' parameter and the 'height' of the default thumbnail in the response.

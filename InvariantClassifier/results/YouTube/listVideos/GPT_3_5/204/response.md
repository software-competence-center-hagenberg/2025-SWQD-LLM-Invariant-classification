## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET method with a query parameter 'id' that is an array.
- The response schema includes a 'pageInfo' object with a 'totalResults' field.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.pageInfo.totalResults == size(input.id[])' checks if the total number of results in the response is equal to the size of the 'id' array in the request.

## Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive because the 'totalResults' in the response does not necessarily have to be equal to the size of the 'id' array in the request. The 'totalResults' represents the total number of results in the result set, which may not be directly related to the size of the 'id' array.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

The invariant return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[] is false-positive. This is because the 'actualEndTime' field is nested within 'liveStreamingDetails', while the 'regionRestriction' and 'blocked' fields are nested within 'contentDetails'. Therefore, there is no direct relationship between these fields in the response body, and the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

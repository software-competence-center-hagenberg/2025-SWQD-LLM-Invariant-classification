## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/youtube/v3/videos" which retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The request parameter "part" is specified as an array of video resource properties.
- The response schema includes a property "items" which contains an array of video resources, each with a "snippet" property that contains a "thumbnails" property, which in turn contains a "medium" property with a "height" property.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.height % size(input.part[]) == 0

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the height of the medium thumbnail is divisible by the number of video resource properties specified in the request.

- The "height" property is a numeric value representing the height of the thumbnail.
- The "input.part[]" represents the array of video resource properties specified in the request.
- The invariant ensures that the height of the medium thumbnail is divisible by the number of video resource properties, indicating a relationship between the number of properties requested and the height of the thumbnail.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a true-positive. The relationship specified by the invariant holds true for every valid request on the API, ensuring that the height of the medium thumbnail is divisible by the number of video resource properties specified in the request.

The invariant compares the width of the medium thumbnail with the size of the tags array in the response. It assumes that the 'medium' thumbnail and 'tags' array are always present in the response, and that their types are always consistent. However, the presence and structure of these fields may not be guaranteed for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive.

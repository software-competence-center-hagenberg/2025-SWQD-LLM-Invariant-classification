## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET method with a description of retrieving a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- It has a query parameter named "maxHeight" which is an optional integer with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192.
- The response to this endpoint includes a list of resources with a structure that contains a field "items" which is an array of objects. Each object in the array has a field "snippet" which is an object containing basic details about a video, including the field "thumbnails".
- The field "thumbnails" is an object containing a field "default" which is an object representing a thumbnail with a field "width" that is an optional integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxHeight > return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width

## Analysis
The invariant compares the query parameter "maxHeight" with the width of the default thumbnail in the response. This comparison ensures that the maxHeight parameter is greater than the width of the default thumbnail.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a true-positive. It holds for every valid request on the API as it ensures that the maxHeight parameter is greater than the width of the default thumbnail in the response.

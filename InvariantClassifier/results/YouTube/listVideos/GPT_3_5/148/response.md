## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation with a description that indicates it retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The operation has a 'part' parameter in the query, which is a required array of video resource properties.
- The response schema includes an 'items' array, where each item contains a 'snippet' object with a 'thumbnails' object inside it.
- The 'thumbnails' object contains a 'default' object, which in turn contains a 'width' property.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width > size(input.part[])

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the width of the default thumbnail in the response is greater than the size of the 'part' parameter array in the request.

- The 'part' parameter is an array of video resource properties, and its size is compared to the width of the default thumbnail in the response.
- The invariant assumes that the width of the default thumbnail is directly related to the size of the 'part' parameter array, which may not be the case.
- There is no direct relationship specified in the Swagger definition between the 'part' parameter and the width of the default thumbnail.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive. It assumes a relationship between the size of the 'part' parameter array and the width of the default thumbnail in the response that is not specified in the API definition. Therefore, it cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

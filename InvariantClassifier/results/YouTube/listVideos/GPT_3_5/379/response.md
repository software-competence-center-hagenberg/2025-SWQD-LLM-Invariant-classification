## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve a list of resources from the endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos".
- The response schema includes a property "items" which contains an array of objects.
- Each object in the array has properties "status" and "selfDeclaredMadeForKids", both of type boolean.

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking if the value of "publicStatsViewable" in the response is equal to the value of "selfDeclaredMadeForKids".

## Analysis
- The invariant type is specified as a binary two-scalar integer equality check.
- However, the properties "publicStatsViewable" and "selfDeclaredMadeForKids" are of type boolean, not integer.
- Therefore, the invariant type specified does not match the data types of the properties being compared.

## Conclusion
- The invariant is false-positive because it uses an incorrect invariant type for the data types being compared.

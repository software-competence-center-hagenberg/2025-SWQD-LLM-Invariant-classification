Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                status:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video category, such as its localized title. Next Id: 17
                  properties:
                    publicStatsViewable:
                      type: boolean
                      description: This value indicates if the extended video statistics on the watch page can be viewed by everyone. Note that the view count, likes, etc will still be visible if this is disabled. @mutable youtube.videos.insert youtube.videos.update
                  properties:
                    selfDeclaredMadeForKids:
                      type: boolean

Invariant: return.status.publicStatsViewable == return.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual

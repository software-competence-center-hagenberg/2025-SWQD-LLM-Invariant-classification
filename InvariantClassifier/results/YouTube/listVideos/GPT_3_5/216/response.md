Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' is a GET request that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- It accepts a query parameter 'maxHeight' of type integer, with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192.
- The response schema includes a 'pageInfo' object with a 'totalResults' property of type integer.

Invariant:
input.maxHeight > return.pageInfo.totalResults

Analysis:
The invariant input.maxHeight > return.pageInfo.totalResults is false-positive. This is because the 'maxHeight' parameter is used for filtering the list of resources, and it is not directly related to the total number of results returned. The 'totalResults' property in the response schema represents the total number of results in the result set, which is not directly influenced by the 'maxHeight' parameter.

Conclusion:
The invariant is false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

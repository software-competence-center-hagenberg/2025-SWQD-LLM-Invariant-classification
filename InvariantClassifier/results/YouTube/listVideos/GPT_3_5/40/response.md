The invariant return.snippet.thumbnails.medium.height == 180 is checking if the height of the medium thumbnail in the response is always equal to 180. This means that for every valid request to the endpoint, the medium thumbnail height should be 180. The Swagger definition provided does not specify any constraints on the height of the medium thumbnail, so this invariant is a false-positive.

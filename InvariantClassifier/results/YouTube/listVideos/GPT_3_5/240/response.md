The invariant LENGTH(return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledStartTime)==20 specifies that the scheduledStartTime field in the liveStreamingDetails object of the response body has a fixed length of 20 characters. The Swagger definition provided does not enforce this constraint, and there is no indication that the scheduledStartTime field will always have a fixed length of 20 characters for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive.

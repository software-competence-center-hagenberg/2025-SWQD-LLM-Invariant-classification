Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                snippet:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video, including title, description, uploader, thumbnails and category.
                  properties:
                    description:
                      type: string
                      description: The video's description. @mutable youtube.videos.insert youtube.videos.update
                  properties:
                    localized:
                      type: object
                      description: Localized versions of certain video properties (e.g. title).
                      properties:
                        description:
                          type: string
                          description: Localized version of the video's description.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.snippet.description == return.snippet.localized.description

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StringEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two String scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

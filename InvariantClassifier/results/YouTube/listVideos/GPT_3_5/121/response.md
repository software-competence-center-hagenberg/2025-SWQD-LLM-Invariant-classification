The invariant return.statistics.commentCount in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[] checks if the comment count of a video is present in the list of allowed region codes for the video. This invariant is false-positive because the comment count of a video is not related to the region restriction of the video. The comment count is a statistic about the video and is not dependent on the region restriction. Therefore, this invariant will not hold for every valid request on the API.

The invariant return.status.license in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[] is checking if the value of status.license is present in the array of allowed region codes. This invariant is false-positive because the 'status' and 'contentDetails' fields are at the same level in the response body, not nested within each other. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

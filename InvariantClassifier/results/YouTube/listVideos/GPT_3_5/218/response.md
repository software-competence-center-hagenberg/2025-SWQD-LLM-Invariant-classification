## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" supports a GET request to retrieve a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The request parameter "maxResults" is of type integer and is optional, with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum length of 50.
- The response body includes a "pageInfo" object with a "totalResults" field of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter "maxResults" should not be equal to the total number of results in the response (return.pageInfo.totalResults).

## Analysis
The invariant is false-positive. The reason is that the total number of results in the response (return.pageInfo.totalResults) may or may not be equal to the value of the input parameter "maxResults". The API does not guarantee that the number of results returned will always be different from the value of "maxResults" provided in the request.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive
The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, as the total number of results in the response may be equal to the value of the input parameter "maxResults" in some cases.

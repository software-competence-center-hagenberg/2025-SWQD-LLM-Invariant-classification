### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET method with a 'part' parameter in the query.
- The response schema includes a 'contentDetails' object with a 'regionRestriction' object containing a 'blocked' array.

### Invariant
- The invariant states that the size of the 'part' parameter array in the request should not be equal to the size of the 'blocked' array in the response.

### Analysis
- The 'part' parameter in the request specifies the video resource properties to include in the API response.
- The 'blocked' array in the response contains region codes that identify countries where the video is blocked.
- The invariant implies that the number of video properties requested should not match the number of countries where the video is blocked, which does not seem to be a meaningful constraint.

### Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive as it does not represent a meaningful constraint for the API endpoint.

The invariant is false-positive because the return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body, which contains an array of objects. The invariant is comparing a field from one array element (return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width) with the size of another array (return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]), which does not hold for every valid request on the API. The comparison should be done within the context of a single array element, not across different array elements.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint is a GET request to "/youtube/v3/videos".
- It accepts a query parameter "id" which is an array of strings.
- The response schema includes a field "items" which is an array of objects, each containing an "id" field of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant is "return.id in input.id[]" which means that the "id" field in the response should be a member of the array of ids in the request.

## Analysis
- The request parameter "id" is an array, so the invariant makes sense in the context of this endpoint.
- The response field "items" contains objects with an "id" field of type string, which aligns with the invariant.
- The invariant holds true for every valid request where the response contains the "id" field that is present in the request's array of ids.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a true-positive for this REST endpoint.

The invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant assumes that the 'maxResults' parameter directly corresponds to the size of the 'items' array in the response. However, this may not always be the case. The 'maxResults' parameter specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the result set, but it does not guarantee that the actual number of items returned will be equal to 'maxResults'. The API may return fewer items than 'maxResults' due to various factors such as filtering, availability, or other constraints. Therefore, the invariant 'input.maxResults >= size(return.items[])' does not hold for every valid request on the API.

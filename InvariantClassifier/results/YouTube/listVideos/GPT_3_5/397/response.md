## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' is a GET request that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes a property 'pageInfo' which contains 'resultsPerPage' indicating the number of results included in the API response.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 0', which states that the number of results per page should be greater than or equal to 0.

## Analysis
- Given the nature of the 'resultsPerPage' property, it is reasonable to expect that the number of results per page should always be greater than or equal to 0. This is a valid constraint for a paginated API response.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: true-positive
- The invariant holds true for every valid request on the API, as it is reasonable to expect that the number of results per page should always be greater than or equal to 0.

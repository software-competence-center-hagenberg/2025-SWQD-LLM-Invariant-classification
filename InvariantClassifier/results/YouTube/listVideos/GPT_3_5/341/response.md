The invariant return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime in return.topicDetails.topicCategories[] is checking if the value of scheduledEndTime is present in the list of topicCategories. This invariant is false-positive because scheduledEndTime and topicCategories are not related in the API definition. The scheduledEndTime is a property of liveStreamingDetails, while topicCategories is a property of topicDetails. There is no direct relationship between these two properties in the API definition, so the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

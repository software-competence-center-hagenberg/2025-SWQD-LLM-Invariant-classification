## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources.
- The response schema includes a property "items" which contains an array of objects.
- Each object in the array has a property "contentDetails" which is an object with a property "caption" of type string and with possible values "true" or "false".

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the response field "contentDetails.caption" is one of {"false", "true"}.

## Analysis
The response field "contentDetails.caption" is explicitly defined to have possible values of "true" or "false" using the enum keyword in the Swagger definition. This means that the invariant holds true for every valid response from the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive

The invariant holds true for every valid response from the API because the response field "contentDetails.caption" is explicitly constrained to the values "true" and "false" in the Swagger definition.

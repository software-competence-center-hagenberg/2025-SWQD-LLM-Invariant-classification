The given invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant compares the 'height' field of 'thumbnails.default' with the size of 'regionRestriction.allowed[]'. However, the 'regionRestriction.allowed[]' is an array, and comparing its size with a scalar value like 'height' does not provide a meaningful comparison. Additionally, the 'height' field and the size of the 'regionRestriction.allowed[]' are unrelated properties, and there is no direct relationship between them that would make this comparison valid for every valid request on the API.

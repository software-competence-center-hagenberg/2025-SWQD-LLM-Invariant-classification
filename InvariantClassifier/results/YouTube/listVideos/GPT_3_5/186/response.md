The invariant compares the height of the standard thumbnail with the size of the tags array in the response. The comparison is based on the assumption that the response will always contain a 'snippet' object with 'thumbnails' and 'tags' properties. However, this assumption is not guaranteed by the Swagger definition, as the 'snippet' object may not always be present in the response. Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive.

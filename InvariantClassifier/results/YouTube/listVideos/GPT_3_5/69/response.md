## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation with a description of retrieving a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The operation has a query parameter named "maxHeight" of type integer with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192.
- The response schema includes a nested structure with properties such as "items" and "snippet" containing details about a video, including thumbnails.
- The thumbnail object has a property named "standard" with a nested structure containing a property "width" of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.maxHeight > return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width

## Analysis
The invariant compares the query parameter "maxHeight" with the width of the standard thumbnail in the response. This comparison ensures that the requested maximum height is greater than the width of the standard thumbnail.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a true-positive. It holds for every valid request on the API as it enforces a logical relationship between the input parameter and the response field.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition contains a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response schema includes a nested structure with properties such as `contentDetails` and `liveStreamingDetails`.

## Invariant

The invariant is checking if the `activeLiveChatId` in `liveStreamingDetails` is a member of the `blocked` array in `regionRestriction` within the response.

## Analysis

The invariant is checking a relationship between two fields in the response body. However, the Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `activeLiveChatId` is related to `regionRestriction.blocked`. Without further context or documentation, it is not possible to determine if this relationship holds true for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, the invariant is a false-positive as it cannot be verified without additional context or documentation.

The invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant is based on the assumption that the 'return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]' and 'return.snippet.tags[]' arrays will always exist and have elements. However, the presence of these arrays is not guaranteed in every valid response. If either of these arrays is missing or empty, the comparison in the invariant will not hold true for that response. Therefore, the invariant is not valid for every valid request on the API.

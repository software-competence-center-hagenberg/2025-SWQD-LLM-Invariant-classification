This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:

        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                snippet:

                      properties:
                        default:
                          type: object
                          description: A thumbnail is an image representing a YouTube resource.

Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height != size(return.snippet.tags[])-1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two long scalars. Prints as x != y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos.
- The response schema includes a property 'contentDetails' which contains a property 'definition' with an enum of ['sd', 'hd'].

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the return value of 'contentDetails.definition' should be one of {'hd', 'sd'}.

## Analysis
- The response schema explicitly defines the 'definition' property as an enum with values 'hd' and 'sd'.
- This means that for every valid response, the 'definition' property will indeed be one of {'hd', 'sd'}.

## Conclusion
Based on the provided swagger definition and the invariant, it is classified as a true-positive invariant.

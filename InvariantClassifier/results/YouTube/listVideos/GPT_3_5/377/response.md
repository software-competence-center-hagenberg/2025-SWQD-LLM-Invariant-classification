## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of resources from the YouTube API.
- The response schema includes a property 'items' which contains an array of video objects.
- Each video object has a 'status' property which contains information about the video, including 'embeddable' and 'selfDeclaredMadeForKids' properties.

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking if the 'embeddable' property of a video status is equal to the 'selfDeclaredMadeForKids' property.

## Analysis
- The invariant type 'daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual' represents an equality check between two long scalar values.
- However, the provided invariant is comparing boolean values ('embeddable' and 'selfDeclaredMadeForKids').
- The comparison of boolean values using the 'IntEqual' invariant type is not appropriate.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive because it uses the wrong invariant type for comparing boolean values, and it will not hold for every valid request on the API.

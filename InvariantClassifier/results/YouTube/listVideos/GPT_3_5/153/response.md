## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube video resources. The endpoint accepts a 'part' parameter in the query, which specifies the video resource properties to be included in the API response.

## Invariant

The invariant 'return.snippet.thumbnails.high.height % size(input.part[]) == 0' checks if the height of the high-quality thumbnail in the API response is divisible by the number of video resource properties specified in the 'part' parameter.

## Analysis

The invariant assumes that the 'part' parameter directly influences the structure of the API response, specifically the 'return.snippet.thumbnails.high.height' field. However, the Swagger definition does not explicitly state that the 'part' parameter affects the structure of the response in a way that would make the invariant universally true.

Additionally, the 'part' parameter is described as specifying the properties to be included in the API response, but it does not necessarily imply that the structure of the 'snippet.thumbnails.high' object will change based on the 'part' parameter.

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.snippet.thumbnails.high.height % size(input.part[]) == 0' is a false-positive. The relationship between the 'part' parameter and the structure of the API response is not explicitly defined in a way that guarantees the invariant to hold for every valid request on the API.

The invariant return.snippet.defaultAudioLanguage in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[] checks if the default audio language of a video is present in the list of allowed region codes for the video. This is a true-positive invariant because it ensures that the default audio language is allowed in the regions where the video is viewable. The Swagger definition indicates that the 'regionRestriction.allowed' field contains a list of region codes where the video is viewable, and the 'snippet.defaultAudioLanguage' field specifies the language spoken in the video's default audio track. Therefore, the invariant holds true for every valid request on the API.

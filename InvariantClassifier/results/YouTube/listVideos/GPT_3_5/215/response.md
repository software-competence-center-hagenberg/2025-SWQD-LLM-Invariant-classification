## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET method with a query parameter 'maxHeight' of type integer.
- The response schema includes a 'pageInfo' object with a 'resultsPerPage' field of type integer.

## Invariant
- input.maxHeight > return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage

## Analysis
- The invariant compares the 'maxHeight' parameter in the request with the 'resultsPerPage' field in the response.
- The invariant checks if the value of 'maxHeight' is greater than the value of 'resultsPerPage'.

## Conclusion
- The invariant is false-positive because there is no guarantee that 'maxHeight' will always be greater than 'resultsPerPage' in every valid request. The comparison is not a general rule for the API and may not hold true for all scenarios.

The invariant return.statistics.dislikeCount in return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[] is false-positive. This is because the 'return' fields refer to the path 'items' in the response body, and the 'contentDetails' and 'statistics' objects are at the same level in the 'items' array, not nested within each other. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition contains a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response schema includes nested properties such as `items`, `snippet`, `thumbnails`, `high`, `height`, `contentDetails`, and `regionRestriction`.

### Invariant

The invariant `return.snippet.thumbnails.high.height % size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) == 0` checks if the height of the high-quality thumbnail is divisible by the size of the blocked region list without remainder.

### Analysis

The invariant is false-positive because the relationship between the height of a thumbnail and the size of the blocked region list is not guaranteed to be a perfect division without remainder for every valid request on the API. The thumbnail height and the blocked region list are independent properties and their sizes are not necessarily related in a way that ensures a perfect division without remainder.

### Conclusion

Verdict: false-positive

The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API as it assumes a specific relationship between two independent properties in the response, which is not guaranteed by the API definition.

Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' is a GET request that retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
- The response schema includes a property 'contentDetails' which contains a property 'regionRestriction' with a property 'blocked' that is an array of strings representing region codes.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) >= 1' checks if the size of the 'blocked' array in the response is greater than or equal to 1.

Analysis:
- The invariant is true-positive because it ensures that the 'blocked' array contains at least one region code, which is necessary for the region restriction to be effective.

Conclusion:
- Verdict: true-positive

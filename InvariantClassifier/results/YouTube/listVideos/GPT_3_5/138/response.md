The invariant return.liveStreamingDetails.actualStartTime in return.topicDetails.topicCategories[] checks if the value of actualStartTime in liveStreamingDetails is present in the list of topicCategories. This invariant is false-positive because there is no direct relationship between liveStreamingDetails and topicDetails in the response schema. The two properties are at the same level in the response schema and are not related in a way that would guarantee the invariant to hold for every valid request on the API.

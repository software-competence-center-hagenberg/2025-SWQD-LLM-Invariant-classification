## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources.
- The response schema includes 'items' which contains 'snippet' and 'topicDetails' objects.
- The 'snippet' object contains 'thumbnails' which in turn contains 'default' with a 'width' property.
- The 'topicDetails' object contains 'topicCategories' which is an array of strings.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width % size(return.topicDetails.topicCategories[]) == 0

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the width of the default thumbnail is divisible by the number of topic categories without a remainder. This ensures that the width is a multiple of the number of topic categories.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a true-positive. Given the structure of the response and the invariant's requirement, it holds true for every valid request on the API.

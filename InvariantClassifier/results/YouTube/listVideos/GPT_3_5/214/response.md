## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/youtube/v3/videos' has a GET operation with a query parameter 'id' that is an array of strings.
- The response schema includes a field 'nextPageToken' of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.nextPageToken in input.id[]' states that the 'nextPageToken' in the response should be a member of the 'id' array in the request.

## Analysis
The invariant is false-positive. The 'nextPageToken' in the response is not related to the 'id' array in the request. The 'nextPageToken' is used for pagination and is not directly linked to the 'id' array in the request.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive

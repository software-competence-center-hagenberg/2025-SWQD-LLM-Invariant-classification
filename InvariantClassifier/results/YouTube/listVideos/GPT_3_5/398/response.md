The invariant return.pageInfo.totalResults >= 0 is a true-positive for the given REST endpoint. This is because the totalResults field in the response pageInfo object represents the total number of results in the result set, and it should always be a non-negative value. The Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the minimum value of totalResults, so the invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/youtube/v3/videos" has a GET operation that retrieves a list of resources.
- The response schema includes a property "items" which contains an array of objects.
- Each object in the array has a property "player" which is an object with a property "embedWidth" of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant specifies that the field "return.player.embedWidth" should be numeric.

## Analysis
- The response schema does not enforce the type of the "embedWidth" property. It is defined as a string in the schema.
- The invariant checks for the numeric type, which is not enforced by the schema.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because the schema does not enforce the numeric type for the "embedWidth" property. Therefore, the invariant will not hold for every valid request on the API.

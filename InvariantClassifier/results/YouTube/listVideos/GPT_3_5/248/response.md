The invariant LENGTH(return.snippet.liveBroadcastContent)==4 is false-positive. The 'liveBroadcastContent' field is defined as a string type with an enum of four possible values: [none, upcoming, live, completed]. This means that the length of the 'liveBroadcastContent' string will always be one of the four enum values, and it cannot have a fixed length of 4. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

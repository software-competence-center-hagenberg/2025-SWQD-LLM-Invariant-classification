## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition includes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of resources from the YouTube API. The endpoint accepts a 'maxResults' query parameter, which specifies the maximum number of items to be returned in the result set. The response schema includes a 'pageInfo' object with a 'resultsPerPage' field, indicating the number of results included in the API response.

## Invariant

The invariant states that the 'maxResults' parameter in the request should be equal to the 'resultsPerPage' field in the response.

## Analysis

The invariant 'input.maxResults == return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage' is false-positive. This is because the 'maxResults' parameter in the request specifies the maximum number of items to be returned, while the 'resultsPerPage' field in the response indicates the number of results included in the API response. These two values may not always be equal, especially if the API is designed to paginate results or if the server imposes a limit on the number of results returned.

## Conclusion

Verdict: false-positive

The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, as the 'maxResults' parameter and 'resultsPerPage' field serve different purposes and may not be equal in all cases.

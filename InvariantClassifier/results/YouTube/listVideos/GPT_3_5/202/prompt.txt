Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
      - name: maxResults
        in: query
        description: The *maxResults* parameter specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the result set. *Note:* This parameter is supported for use in conjunction with the myRating and chart parameters, but it is not supported for use in conjunction with the id parameter.
        required: false
        type: integer
        minimum: 1
        maxLength: 50
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            pageInfo:
              type: object
              description: Paging details for lists of resources, including total number of items available and number of resources returned in a single page.
              properties:
                resultsPerPage:
                  type: integer
                  description: The number of results included in the API response.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.maxResults == return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of == between two long scalars. Prints as x == y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/youtube/v3/videos".
- The response schema includes a property "items" which contains an array of objects.
- Each object in the array has a property "player" which is an object with properties "embedHtml" and "embedWidth".

## Invariant
The invariant states that "return.player.embedWidth" is a substring of "return.player.embedHtml".

## Analysis
The provided Swagger definition does not guarantee that the "embedWidth" is a substring of "embedHtml". The schema does not enforce any specific relationship between these two properties, and the API response may contain any valid values for these properties.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API. The Swagger definition does not enforce the substring relationship between the specified properties in the response.

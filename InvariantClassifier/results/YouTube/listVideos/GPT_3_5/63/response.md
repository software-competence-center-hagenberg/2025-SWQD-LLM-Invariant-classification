## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube resources. The endpoint accepts a 'maxHeight' parameter in the query.

## Invariant

The invariant states that 'input.maxHeight' should be greater than 'return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width'.

## Analysis

Based on the Swagger definition, the 'maxHeight' parameter is optional and represents the maximum height of a video. The response schema includes 'snippet' and 'thumbnails' fields, with 'high' containing 'width' as an optional property. Therefore, the invariant is false-positive because the 'maxHeight' parameter is optional, and the 'width' property in 'return.snippet.thumbnails.high' is also optional. This means that the invariant will not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion

The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

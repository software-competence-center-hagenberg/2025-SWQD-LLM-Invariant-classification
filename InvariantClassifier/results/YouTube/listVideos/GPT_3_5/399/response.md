## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition provided describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response schema includes a property `contentDetails` which contains a property `contentRating` with a sub-property `ytRating`.

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the length of the `ytRating` string in the response is always 15.

## Analysis
Based on the provided swagger definition, there is no indication that the length of the `ytRating` string is fixed at 15 characters. The enum values for `ytRating` are 'ytUnspecified' and 'ytAgeRestricted', and neither of these values has a length of 15. Therefore, this invariant is a false-positive.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive

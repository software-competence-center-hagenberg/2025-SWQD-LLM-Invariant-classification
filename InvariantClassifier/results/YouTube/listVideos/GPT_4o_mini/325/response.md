### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The request can include an optional query parameter `maxWidth`, which is an integer with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192. The response contains an object with an array of items, where each item includes a `snippet` object that contains a `thumbnails` object. The `thumbnails.default` object has a `width` property that is also an integer.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter `maxWidth` should not be equal to the `width` of the default thumbnail in the response: `input.maxWidth != return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width`. This is classified as a binary inequality between two integer values.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Parameters**: The `maxWidth` parameter is intended to specify the maximum height of the player, but it does not directly dictate the width of the thumbnails returned in the response. The `width` of the thumbnail is determined by the YouTube API and may not necessarily correlate with the `maxWidth` parameter.
2. **Possible Values**: The `maxWidth` can take any integer value starting from 72 up to 8192. The `width` of the thumbnail can also be any integer value, depending on the video and its associated thumbnails. There is no inherent rule or guarantee that these two values will always be different. For instance, if the `maxWidth` is set to a specific value that matches the width of the thumbnail, the invariant would be violated.
3. **Counterexample**: If `maxWidth` is set to 100 and the thumbnail width is also 100, the invariant `input.maxWidth != return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width` would not hold true, demonstrating that the invariant is not universally valid.

### Conclusion
The invariant `input.maxWidth != return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width` is a **false-positive** because there are valid scenarios where the `maxWidth` can equal the `width` of the thumbnail, thus violating the invariant. Therefore, it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

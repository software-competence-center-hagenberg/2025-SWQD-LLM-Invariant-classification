### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will be an object containing an array called `items`. Each item in this array has a `contentDetails` object, which includes a property `caption`. The `caption` property is defined as a string that can take on one of two values: `true` or `false`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.contentDetails.caption` can only be one of the values in the set { "false", "true" }. This is a unary string invariant indicating that the `caption` property must be one of the specified string values.

### Analysis
According to the Swagger definition, the `caption` property is explicitly defined with an `enum` that restricts its values to `true` or `false`. This means that for every valid response from the API, the `caption` field will always be either `true` or `false`. There are no other possible values for this field, as it is strictly defined by the schema.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant accurately reflects the constraints defined in the Swagger specification, it holds true for every valid request to the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/youtube/v3/videos` that returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource has a `player` object, which contains two properties: `embedHeight` and `embedHtml`. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.player.embedHeight` is a substring of `return.player.embedHtml`. This means that the value of `embedHeight` should appear somewhere within the `embedHtml` string. 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**: 
   - `embedHeight`: This is a string that represents the height of the video player. 
   - `embedHtml`: This is a string that contains an HTML `<iframe>` tag used to embed the video player. 

2. **Relationship Between Properties**: 
   - The `embedHtml` string typically contains attributes for the `<iframe>` tag, such as `height`, which may or may not correspond to the `embedHeight` value. 
   - The `embedHeight` value is not guaranteed to be included as a substring in the `embedHtml`. For example, if `embedHeight` is "360" and `embedHtml` is `<iframe width='640' height='480' src='...'></iframe>`, then "360" is not a substring of the `embedHtml`. 
   - There is no explicit requirement in the Swagger definition that mandates `embedHeight` to be part of `embedHtml`. 

### Conclusion
Given that there is no guarantee that `embedHeight` will always be a substring of `embedHtml`, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

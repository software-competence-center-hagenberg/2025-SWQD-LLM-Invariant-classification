### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response schema indicates that each video item contains a `contentDetails` object, which includes a `regionRestriction` object. This `regionRestriction` object has an `allowed` property, which is an array of strings representing country codes where the video is viewable. The description specifies that if the `allowed` property is present and contains an empty list, the video is blocked in all countries.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `allowed` array in the `regionRestriction` object must be one of the values in the set {80, 94}. This means that the allowed array can only have 80 or 94 elements.

### Analysis
The invariant is asserting that the size of the `allowed` array is restricted to two specific values (80 or 94). However, the Swagger definition does not provide any constraints on the number of allowed countries that can be present in the `allowed` array. The `allowed` array can potentially have any number of elements, including 0 (if it is empty, indicating the video is blocked in all countries) or more than 94. Therefore, there is no basis in the Swagger definition to support the claim that the size of the `allowed` array can only be 80 or 94.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant imposes specific constraints on the size of the `allowed` array that are not supported by the Swagger definition, it is classified as a false-positive. The actual size of the `allowed` array can vary and is not limited to the values specified in the invariant.

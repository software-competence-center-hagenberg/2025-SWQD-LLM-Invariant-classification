### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which returns a response containing a list of video resources. Each video resource includes a `statistics` object, which has a property `likeCount`. The `likeCount` is defined as a string that represents the number of users who liked the video.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.statistics.likeCount` is Numeric, which means that the value of `likeCount` should always be a numeric string (i.e., it should only contain characters that are numeric).

### Analysis
According to the Swagger definition, `likeCount` is explicitly defined as a string. While it is likely that the string will contain numeric characters (e.g., "123", "456"), there is no guarantee that it will always be numeric. For example, if the API were to return a value like "N/A" or "unknown" when the like count is not available, this would violate the invariant. Therefore, the invariant cannot be considered universally true for all possible responses from the API.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API (as there could be cases where `likeCount` is not a numeric string), the classification of the invariant is a **false-positive**.

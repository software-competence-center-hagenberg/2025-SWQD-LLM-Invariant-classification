### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response is an object containing an array of items, where each item has a `status` object with properties `embeddable` and `selfDeclaredMadeForKids`, both of which are boolean values.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.status.embeddable == return.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids`. This means that for every video resource returned, the value of `embeddable` must equal the value of `selfDeclaredMadeForKids`.

### Analysis
The properties `embeddable` and `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` are independent boolean values. The `embeddable` property indicates whether the video can be embedded on another website, while `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` indicates whether the video is marked as made for kids. These two properties serve different purposes and can have different values. For example, a video can be embeddable but not made for kids, or vice versa. Therefore, it is possible for `embeddable` to be `true` while `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` is `false`, and vice versa.

### Conclusion
Since the two properties are independent and can have different values, the invariant `return.status.embeddable == return.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids` does not hold for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

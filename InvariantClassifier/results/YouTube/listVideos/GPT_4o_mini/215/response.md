### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The request can include a query parameter `maxHeight`, which is an optional integer with a minimum value of 72. The response includes a `pageInfo` object that contains `resultsPerPage`, which is also an integer representing the number of results returned in a single page.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxHeight > return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage`, meaning that the value of `maxHeight` in the request must be greater than the number of results returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Parameters**: The `maxHeight` parameter is intended to filter the videos based on their height, but it does not directly control the number of results returned. The `resultsPerPage` indicates how many results are included in the response, which can vary based on the total number of available resources and other filtering criteria.
2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If the API returns fewer results than `maxHeight`, the invariant would hold true. 
   - However, if the API returns a number of results that is equal to or greater than `maxHeight`, the invariant would not hold. For example, if `maxHeight` is set to 100 and the API returns 150 results, the invariant fails (100 is not greater than 150).
3. **Lack of Direct Relationship**: There is no direct relationship between `maxHeight` and `resultsPerPage` that guarantees the invariant will always hold. The filtering based on height does not inherently limit the number of results returned to be less than the height specified.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant `input.maxHeight > return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage` does not hold true in all cases due to the lack of a direct correlation between the request parameter and the response value, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

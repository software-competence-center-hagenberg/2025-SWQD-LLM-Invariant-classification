### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `pageInfo` object, which contains a property `totalResults`. This property is defined as an integer that represents the total number of results in the result set.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.pageInfo.totalResults >= 0`. This means that the total number of results returned by the API should always be greater than or equal to zero.

### Analysis
In the context of APIs, the `totalResults` field typically indicates the count of items that match the query criteria. It is a common practice for such counts to be non-negative, as it would not make sense to have a negative count of resources. 

Given that `totalResults` is defined as an integer and represents a count, it logically follows that this value should always be zero or greater. There are no scenarios in standard API behavior where a count of resources would be negative. 

### Conclusion
Based on the definition of `totalResults` and the typical behavior of APIs regarding resource counts, the invariant `return.pageInfo.totalResults >= 0` is correct and holds true for every valid request to this API endpoint. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will include an `items` array, where each item contains a `statistics` object. Within this `statistics` object, there is a property called `dislikeCount`, which is defined as a string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.statistics.dislikeCount is Numeric`, which implies that the value of `dislikeCount` should always be a numeric value.

### Analysis
According to the Swagger definition, `dislikeCount` is defined as a string. This means that while it may contain numeric characters, it is not guaranteed to be a numeric value. Strings can contain non-numeric characters, and even if they are numeric in appearance, they are still considered strings. Therefore, the invariant that `dislikeCount` is numeric does not hold true for every valid response from the API, as the value can be a string that does not represent a numeric value (e.g., "N/A", "unknown").

### Conclusion
Given that `dislikeCount` is defined as a string in the Swagger definition, the invariant that it is numeric is incorrect. Thus, the invariant is classified as a false-positive.

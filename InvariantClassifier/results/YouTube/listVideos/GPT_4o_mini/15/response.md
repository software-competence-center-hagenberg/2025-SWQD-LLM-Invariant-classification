### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an `items` array, where each item has a `contentDetails` object. Within `contentDetails`, there is a `countryRestriction` property that is an object describing rights management policy for YouTube resources.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.contentDetails.countryRestriction == null`. This implies that for every valid response from the API, the `countryRestriction` property will always be null.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding `countryRestriction`:** The `countryRestriction` property is described as an object related to rights management. This suggests that it may contain information about which countries have restrictions on the video content.
2. **Possible Values:** Given that `countryRestriction` is an object, it can potentially hold various values depending on the video's rights management policies. It is not guaranteed to be null for every video; some videos may have restrictions based on the country, while others may not.
3. **Implication of the Invariant:** If the invariant were true, it would mean that all videos returned by this endpoint do not have any country restrictions, which is unlikely given the nature of content on platforms like YouTube.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.contentDetails.countryRestriction == null` does not hold for every valid request on the API, as there will be cases where `countryRestriction` is not null. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an `items` array, where each item can have properties like `liveStreamingDetails` and `topicDetails`. 

- `liveStreamingDetails` contains `actualEndTime`, which is a string that indicates when a live broadcast ended, but this value is only available after the broadcast is over.
- `topicDetails` contains `topicCategories`, which is an array of strings representing Wikipedia URLs related to the video's content.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime` is always a member of `return.topicDetails.topicCategories[]`. In simpler terms, it suggests that the actual end time of a live stream will always be found within the list of topic categories associated with the video.

### Analysis
1. **Nature of `actualEndTime`:** The `actualEndTime` is a string that represents a timestamp of when a live broadcast ended. This value is only available if the broadcast has concluded.
2. **Nature of `topicCategories`:** The `topicCategories` is an array of strings that contains URLs related to the video's content. These URLs are not inherently related to the timestamp of when a live broadcast ended.
3. **Logical Relationship:** There is no logical basis to assert that a timestamp (like `actualEndTime`) would be a member of an array of URLs (like `topicCategories`). They represent fundamentally different types of data. 

### Conclusion
Given that `actualEndTime` is a timestamp and `topicCategories` contains URLs, the invariant that `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime` is always a member of `return.topicDetails.topicCategories[]` is incorrect. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

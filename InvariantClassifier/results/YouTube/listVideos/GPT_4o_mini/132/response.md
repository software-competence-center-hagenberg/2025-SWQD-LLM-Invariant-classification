### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. Each video resource contains `contentDetails` and `recordingDetails`. The `contentDetails` includes a `regionRestriction` object that has a `blocked` property, which is an array of region codes where the video is blocked. The `recordingDetails` contains a `recordingDate` property that indicates when the video was recorded.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.recordingDetails.recordingDate` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`. This means that the date when the video was recorded is expected to be one of the region codes where the video is blocked.

### Analysis
1. **Data Types**: The `recordingDate` is a string representing a date and time, while `blocked` is an array of strings representing region codes (country codes). These are fundamentally different types of data.
2. **Logical Relation**: There is no logical connection between the recording date of a video and the region codes where it may be blocked. The `blocked` array is meant to indicate geographical restrictions, while the `recordingDate` is purely temporal information.
3. **Use Cases**: It is highly unlikely that a recording date would ever match a region code. For example, a recording date might be something like "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z", while region codes are typically two-letter country codes like "US", "CA", etc.

### Conclusion
Given the differences in data types and the lack of any logical relationship between the recording date and the region codes, the invariant that `return.recordingDetails.recordingDate` is a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]` is incorrect. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an array of items, each with a `snippet` object that includes a `thumbnails` object. Within `thumbnails`, there is a `default` object that contains a `height` property, which is an integer.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height == 90`. This implies that for every valid response from the API, the height of the default thumbnail must be equal to 90.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that the height of the thumbnail is fixed at 90. However, the Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the values of `height`. It only states that `height` is an integer and does not provide any specific values or range for it. Therefore, the height could potentially be any integer value, not just 90. 

Since the API can return different videos, and each video might have different thumbnail sizes, it is highly unlikely that the height will always be 90. This means that the invariant does not hold for every valid request, as there could be cases where the height is different from 90.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant is based on a specific value (90) without any supporting constraints in the Swagger definition, it cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

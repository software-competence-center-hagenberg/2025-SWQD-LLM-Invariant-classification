### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The `part` parameter is required and specifies which properties of the video resource should be included in the response. The response schema indicates that the `contentDetails` object may contain a `regionRestriction` property, which has a `blocked` array listing countries where the video is blocked.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `input.part` array is not equal to the size of the `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked` array. This is expressed as `size(input.part[]) != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding `input.part[]`:** The `part` parameter can include multiple properties, and its size can vary depending on how many properties the client requests. For example, if a client requests `part=snippet`, the size of `input.part` would be 1. If they request `part=snippet,contentDetails`, the size would be 2.

2. **Understanding `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`:** The `blocked` array can also vary in size based on the video being retrieved. If a video is viewable in all countries, the `blocked` array could be empty. If a video is blocked in certain countries, the size of this array will depend on how many countries are listed.

3. **Possible Scenarios:** 
   - If `input.part` has 1 element and `blocked` is empty, the invariant holds (1 != 0).
   - If `input.part` has 2 elements and `blocked` has 1 element, the invariant holds (2 != 1).
   - However, if `input.part` has 1 element and `blocked` also has 1 element (e.g., the video is blocked in one country), the invariant does not hold (1 == 1).
   - Similarly, if `input.part` has 2 elements and `blocked` has 2 elements, the invariant does not hold (2 == 2).

### Conclusion
The invariant `size(input.part[]) != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])` does not hold true for all valid requests to the API. There are scenarios where both sizes can be equal, making this invariant a false-positive.

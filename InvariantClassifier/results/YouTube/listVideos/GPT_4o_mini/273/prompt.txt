This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            nextPageToken:
              type: string
              description: The token that can be used as the value of the pageToken parameter to retrieve the next page in the result set.

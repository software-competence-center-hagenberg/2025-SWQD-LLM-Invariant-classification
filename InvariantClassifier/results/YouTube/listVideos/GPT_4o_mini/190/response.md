### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos, which includes various properties such as `snippet`, `thumbnails`, and `contentDetails`. The `thumbnails` object contains a `standard` property with a `width`, while the `contentDetails` object includes a `regionRestriction` property that has a `blocked` array.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the width of the standard thumbnail (`return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width`) is greater than the size of the blocked regions array (`size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`). 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**:
   - `return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width`: This is an integer representing the width of the thumbnail image.
   - `size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`: This represents the number of countries where the video is blocked. It can be zero (if the video is viewable in all countries) or any positive integer.

2. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If `width` is, for example, 200, and `blocked` is an empty array, then the invariant holds true (200 > 0).
   - If `width` is 100 and `blocked` contains 5 countries, the invariant does not hold (100 is not greater than 5).
   - If `width` is 0 (hypothetically, if it were allowed), the invariant would not hold regardless of the size of `blocked`.

3. **Conclusion**: The invariant does not consistently hold true for all valid responses. There are scenarios where the width of the thumbnail can be less than or equal to the number of blocked regions, making the invariant false in those cases.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant is a **false-positive** because it does not hold for every valid request on the API. There are valid responses where the width of the thumbnail is less than or equal to the size of the blocked regions array.

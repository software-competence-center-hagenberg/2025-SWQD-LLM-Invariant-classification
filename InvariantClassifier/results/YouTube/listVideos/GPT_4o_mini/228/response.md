### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource contains a `contentDetails` object, which has a property `definition`. The `definition` property is a string that can take one of two values: 'sd' or 'hd'. This means that the `definition` property can only be one of these two strings.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `definition` string is always equal to 2: `LENGTH(return.contentDetails.definition)==2`. This implies that every possible value of `definition` must have exactly 2 characters.

### Analysis
The possible values for `definition` are 'sd' and 'hd'. Both of these strings indeed have a length of 2 characters:
- 'sd' has a length of 2
- 'hd' has a length of 2

Since the invariant claims that the length of the `definition` string is always 2, and both possible values of `definition` satisfy this condition, the invariant holds true for every valid request on this API.

### Conclusion
The invariant `LENGTH(return.contentDetails.definition)==2` is correct and holds for every valid response from the API, as all possible values of `definition` are guaranteed to have a length of 2. Therefore, the classification of the invariant is a **true-positive**.

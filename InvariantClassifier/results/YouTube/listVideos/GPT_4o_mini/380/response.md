### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an `items` array, where each item has a `contentDetails` object. Within `contentDetails`, there is a `contentRating` object that contains a property `ytRating`. The `ytRating` property can take on one of two values: `ytUnspecified` or `ytAgeRestricted`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `ytRating` must equal `"ytAgeRestricted"` in the response. This is expressed as:  
`return.contentDetails.contentRating.ytRating == "ytAgeRestricted"`

### Analysis
The invariant is asserting that every response from this endpoint will have the `ytRating` set to `ytAgeRestricted`. However, the Swagger definition indicates that `ytRating` can also be `ytUnspecified`. Therefore, it is possible for the `ytRating` to be `ytUnspecified` in some responses. Since the invariant does not account for this possibility and asserts that `ytRating` will always be `ytAgeRestricted`, it does not hold true for every valid response from the API.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant does not hold for all valid responses (as `ytRating` can also be `ytUnspecified`), the classification of the invariant is a **false-positive**.

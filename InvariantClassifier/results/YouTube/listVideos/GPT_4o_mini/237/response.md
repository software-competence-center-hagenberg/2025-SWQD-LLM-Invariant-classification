### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. The response includes a property `liveStreamingDetails`, which contains an `actualEndTime` field. This field is described as a string that represents the time the broadcast actually ended, and it is stated that this value will not be available until the broadcast is over.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime` is a timestamp formatted as `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmZ`, where milliseconds are optional. This invariant is classified under the type `daikon.inv.unary.string.dates.IsTimestampYYYYMMHHThhmmssmm`, indicating that it checks if the string adheres to a specific timestamp format.

### Analysis
The key point in the Swagger definition is that `actualEndTime` will not be available until the broadcast is over. This implies that for ongoing broadcasts, the `actualEndTime` field may not be present in the response at all, or it may be null or an empty string. If `actualEndTime` is not present or is null, it cannot be classified as a valid timestamp, thus violating the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given that the `actualEndTime` field may not always be present or may not contain a valid timestamp format when the broadcast is ongoing, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

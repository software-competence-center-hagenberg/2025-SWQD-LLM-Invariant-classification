### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of videos from YouTube. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an array of items, each with a `snippet` and `contentDetails`. The `snippet` includes a `thumbnails` object, which has a `high` property that contains a `width` integer. The `contentDetails` includes a `regionRestriction` object, which has a `blocked` property that is an array of strings representing region codes where the video is blocked.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the width of the high thumbnail (`return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width`) is greater than the size of the array of blocked regions (`size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`).

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**:
   - `return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width`: This is an integer representing the width of the thumbnail image.
   - `size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`: This represents the number of regions where the video is blocked. It can be 0 (if the video is viewable in all countries), or any positive integer depending on the restrictions.

2. **Evaluating the Invariant**:
   - The width of a thumbnail can vary widely based on the video and its associated thumbnails. It is not guaranteed to be greater than the number of blocked regions.
   - For example, if a video has a thumbnail width of 2 and is blocked in 3 regions, the invariant would not hold (2 > 3 is false).
   - Additionally, if the video is viewable in all countries, the size of the blocked array would be 0, and the invariant would hold (2 > 0 is true). However, this does not guarantee that the invariant holds for all possible cases.

3. **Conclusion**: The invariant does not hold universally for all valid requests. There are scenarios where the width of the thumbnail could be less than or equal to the number of blocked regions, making the invariant a false-positive.

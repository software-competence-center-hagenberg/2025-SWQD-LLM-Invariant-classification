### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource can have `contentDetails` and `liveStreamingDetails` properties. 

- **contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked**: This is an array of strings representing country codes where the video is blocked. If this property is present and contains an empty list, the video is viewable in all countries. 
- **liveStreamingDetails.scheduledStartTime**: This is a string representing the scheduled start time of a live broadcast.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledStartTime` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`. 

### Analysis
1. **Nature of Properties**: The `scheduledStartTime` is a string that indicates when a live stream is scheduled to start. It does not relate to the region restriction or the blocked countries in any way. 
2. **Data Types**: The `blocked` property is an array of strings representing country codes, while `scheduledStartTime` is a timestamp string. There is no logical connection between a timestamp and a country code. 
3. **Possible Values**: Even if `scheduledStartTime` were to contain a string that resembles a country code, it would not be a valid member of the `blocked` array, as they represent entirely different concepts. 

### Conclusion
The invariant is incorrect because there is no logical or structural relationship between `liveStreamingDetails.scheduledStartTime` and `contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, making it a **false-positive**.

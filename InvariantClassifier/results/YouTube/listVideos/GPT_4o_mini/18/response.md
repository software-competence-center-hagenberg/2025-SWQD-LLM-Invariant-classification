### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an `items` array, where each item has a `contentDetails` object. Within `contentDetails`, there is a `projection` property that can take on one of two string values: `rectangular` or `360`.

### Invariant
The invariant states: `return.contentDetails.projection == "rectangular"`. This means that the invariant asserts that the `projection` property of `contentDetails` will always be equal to `"rectangular"` in the response.

### Analysis
The `projection` property is defined to be of type string with an enum that includes both `rectangular` and `360`. This means that the `projection` can legally take on either of these values in the response. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that `projection` will always be `rectangular`. There are valid scenarios where the `projection` could be `360`, which would violate the invariant.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant asserts that `projection` will always be `rectangular`, but the API allows for `projection` to also be `360`, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

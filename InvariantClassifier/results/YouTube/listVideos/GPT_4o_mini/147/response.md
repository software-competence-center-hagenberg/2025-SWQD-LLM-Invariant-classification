### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint. The response includes a list of video resources, each containing a `snippet` object with various properties, including `thumbnails`. The `thumbnails` object has a `default` property, which itself contains a `width` property of type integer.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the width of the default thumbnail (`return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width`) is divisible by the size of the input parameter array (`input.part[]`). This is expressed mathematically as `return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width % size(input.part[]) == 0`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests a relationship between the width of the thumbnail and the number of elements in the `part` parameter. Specifically, it claims that the width should be divisible by the number of parts requested.
2. **Evaluating Valid Requests**: The `part` parameter is required and can contain multiple values, but the width of the thumbnail is determined by the video resource and is independent of the number of parts requested. For example, if the width of the thumbnail is 120 and the `part` array has 3 elements, the invariant would hold true (120 % 3 == 0). However, if the width is 125 and the `part` array has 3 elements, the invariant would not hold (125 % 3 != 0).
3. **General Case**: Since the width of the thumbnail can be any integer and is not guaranteed to have a specific relationship with the size of the `part` array, there will be cases where the invariant does not hold. The invariant assumes a mathematical relationship that does not exist in the API's design.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width % size(input.part[]) == 0` does not hold for every valid request to the API, as the width of the thumbnail is not inherently related to the number of parts specified in the request. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

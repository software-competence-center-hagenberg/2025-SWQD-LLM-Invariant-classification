### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which returns a response containing a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will include an array of items, each containing a `player` object and a `status` object. The `player` object has a property `embedHtml`, which is a string representing an iframe tag for video playback. The `status` object contains a property `license`, which is a string that can take values from a predefined set (either 'youtube' or 'creativeCommon').

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.status.license` is a substring of `return.player.embedHtml`. This means that the value of the `license` field should appear somewhere within the `embedHtml` string.

### Analysis
1. **Nature of the Fields**: The `license` field is a string that indicates the type of license associated with the video, while `embedHtml` is a string that contains HTML markup for embedding a video player. 
2. **Content Relationship**: There is no inherent relationship between the license type and the content of the embed HTML. The `embedHtml` string is likely to contain HTML tags and attributes, while the `license` string contains specific values ('youtube' or 'creativeCommon'). 
3. **Examples**: For instance, an `embedHtml` string might look like `<iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/video_id'></iframe>`, which does not contain the words 'youtube' or 'creativeCommon'. Therefore, it is entirely possible for the `license` to not be a substring of the `embedHtml`.

### Conclusion
Given that there is no guaranteed relationship between the `license` value and the content of the `embedHtml`, the invariant that `return.status.license` is a substring of `return.player.embedHtml` does not hold for every valid response. Thus, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

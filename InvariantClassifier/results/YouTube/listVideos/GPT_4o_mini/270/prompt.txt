Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                player:
                  type: object
                  description: Player to be used for a video playback.
                  properties:
                    embedHtml:
                      type: string
                      description: An <iframe> tag that embeds a player that will play the video.
              items:
                status:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video category, such as its localized title. Next Id: 17
                  properties:
                    license:
                      type: string
                      description: The video's license. @mutable youtube.videos.insert youtube.videos.update
                      enum: [youtube, creativeCommon]


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.status.license is a substring of return.player.embedHtml

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString
Invariant description: Represents the substring invariant between two String scalars. Prints as x is a substring of y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

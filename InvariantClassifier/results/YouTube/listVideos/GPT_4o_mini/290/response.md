### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will include an array of items, each containing a snippet with thumbnails, including a high-resolution thumbnail with a width property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the width of the high thumbnail (`return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width`) must be greater than the size of the input array of IDs (`size(input.id[])`). This is expressed as `return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width > size(input.id[])`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant compares the width of a thumbnail image to the number of IDs provided in the request. The width is a property of the video resource, while the size of the input array is a count of how many video IDs were requested.
2. **Possible Values**: The width of a thumbnail can vary based on the video and its properties. It is not guaranteed that the width will always be greater than the number of IDs provided. For instance, if the width is 1 and the input ID array has 2 IDs, the invariant would not hold.
3. **Context of the API**: The API allows for filtering videos based on IDs, and it is possible to request zero or more IDs. If no IDs are provided, the size of the input array would be 0, and the invariant would hold true if the width is greater than 0. However, if multiple IDs are provided, the invariant may not hold true if the width is less than or equal to the number of IDs.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width > size(input.id[])` does not hold for every valid request to the API. There are scenarios where the width of the thumbnail could be less than or equal to the number of IDs provided, making this invariant a false-positive.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response is an object containing an array of `items`. Each item can have properties `liveStreamingDetails` and `snippet`. The `liveStreamingDetails` object contains a property `scheduledEndTime`, which is a string that indicates when a live broadcast is scheduled to end. The `snippet` object contains a property `tags`, which is an array of strings representing keyword tags associated with the video.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime` is always a member of `return.snippet.tags[]`. This means that the scheduled end time of a live stream should always be included in the tags associated with the video.

### Analysis
1. **Nature of Properties**: The `scheduledEndTime` is a property that indicates a specific time, while `tags` are keyword strings that describe the video. There is no inherent relationship that guarantees that a timestamp (like `scheduledEndTime`) will be included in a list of keyword tags.
2. **Empty or Absent Values**: The Swagger definition mentions that if `scheduledEndTime` is empty or not present, the broadcast is scheduled to continue indefinitely. This further implies that there may be cases where `scheduledEndTime` does not exist or is not relevant to the tags.
3. **Lack of Direct Correlation**: Tags are typically used for categorization or search purposes, and there is no indication that the scheduled end time of a live stream would be a relevant or useful tag. Tags are more likely to be descriptive keywords rather than specific timestamps.

### Conclusion
Given the nature of the properties involved and the lack of a logical connection between `scheduledEndTime` and `tags`, the invariant that `return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime` is always a member of `return.snippet.tags[]` is incorrect. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

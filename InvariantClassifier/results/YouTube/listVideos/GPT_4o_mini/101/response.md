### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource can contain various details, including `contentDetails` and `liveStreamingDetails`. 

- **contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed**: This property is an array of strings that specifies the countries where the video is viewable. If this property is present and contains an empty list, it indicates that the video is blocked in all countries.
- **liveStreamingDetails.scheduledStartTime**: This property is a string that indicates when a live broadcast is scheduled to start.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledStartTime` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]`. 

### Analysis
1. **Nature of Properties**: The `liveStreamingDetails.scheduledStartTime` is a timestamp indicating when a live stream is scheduled to start, while `contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]` is a list of country codes where the video can be viewed. These two properties are fundamentally different in nature; one is a time and the other is a list of strings representing country codes.
2. **Logical Connection**: There is no logical connection that guarantees that a timestamp (scheduled start time) would ever be a member of a list of country codes. The invariant suggests a relationship that does not exist based on the definitions provided in the Swagger documentation.
3. **Possible Scenarios**: It is possible for `liveStreamingDetails` to exist without any corresponding entries in `contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]`, especially if the video is not restricted to any specific countries or if the video is blocked in all countries.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant is incorrect as it asserts a relationship between two unrelated properties. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an `items` array, where each item has a `snippet` object that includes a `thumbnails` object. Within `thumbnails`, there is a `maxres` object that contains a `height` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.height == 720`. This implies that for every valid response from this endpoint, the height of the maximum resolution thumbnail must always be 720 pixels.

### Analysis
1. **Response Variability**: The invariant suggests that the `height` of the `maxres` thumbnail is fixed at 720. However, the Swagger definition does not specify that the `height` must always be 720. It only describes the structure of the response and does not impose any constraints on the values of `height`.
2. **Possible Values**: The `height` property is described as an integer and is marked as optional. This means that it can potentially take on various values or even be absent in some responses. Since the definition does not restrict the height to a specific value, it is possible for the `height` to be different from 720 in valid responses.
3. **Real-World API Behavior**: In practice, APIs often return different resolutions for thumbnails based on various factors such as the video quality, user settings, or even the specific video being queried. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the `height` could vary.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant asserts a specific value for the `height` property without any backing from the Swagger definition, and considering the potential variability in the API's response, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. It does not hold for every valid request on the API, as the `height` could be different from 720 in many cases.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource contains `contentDetails` and `snippet` objects. 

- **contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked**: This is an array that lists region codes where the video is blocked. If this array is present and empty, it indicates the video is viewable in all countries. 
- **snippet.tags**: This is an array of keyword tags associated with the video. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `blocked` array minus one is not equal to the size of the `tags` array, expressed as:

`size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) - 1 != size(return.snippet.tags[])`

### Analysis
1. **Empty Arrays**: If `blocked` is an empty array, then `size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])` is 0. Thus, the invariant would evaluate to `-1 != size(return.snippet.tags[])`. If `tags` is also empty, this would be false. 
2. **Non-empty Arrays**: If `blocked` has elements, say `n`, then the invariant becomes `n - 1 != size(return.snippet.tags[])`. This could hold true or false depending on the size of `tags`. For example, if `blocked` has 1 element and `tags` has 0, the invariant holds true. However, if `blocked` has 1 element and `tags` has 1, the invariant would be false. 
3. **No Guaranteed Relationship**: There is no inherent relationship between the number of blocked regions and the number of tags. The two arrays can vary independently based on the video's metadata and restrictions. 

### Conclusion
Given that the sizes of `blocked` and `tags` can vary independently and can lead to situations where the invariant does not hold (e.g., both being empty or having the same size), the invariant is not guaranteed to be true for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

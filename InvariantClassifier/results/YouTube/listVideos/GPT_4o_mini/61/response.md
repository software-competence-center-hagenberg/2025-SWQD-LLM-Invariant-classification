### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The request can include a query parameter `maxHeight`, which is an optional integer with a minimum value of 72. The response is an object that contains an array of `items`, where each item has a `snippet` containing a `thumbnails` object. The `thumbnails.default` object has a `width` property, which is also an integer.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter `maxHeight` must be greater than the `width` of the `thumbnails.default` in the response: `input.maxHeight > return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width`. 

### Analysis
1. **Input Parameter**: The `maxHeight` parameter is optional and can be omitted in the request. If it is omitted, it does not have a value, which means it cannot be compared to any width value from the response.
2. **Response Property**: The `width` of the thumbnail can vary based on the video and is not guaranteed to be less than `maxHeight`. For instance, if a video has a thumbnail width of 100 and the request does not specify `maxHeight`, the invariant cannot hold since `maxHeight` is undefined.
3. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If `maxHeight` is set to a value less than or equal to the `width`, the invariant will fail.
   - If `maxHeight` is omitted, the invariant cannot be evaluated.
   - If `maxHeight` is greater than `width`, the invariant holds true.

Given these points, the invariant does not hold for every valid request, particularly when `maxHeight` is omitted or set to a value that does not satisfy the condition. 

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it does not hold for every valid request on the API, especially when `maxHeight` is not provided or is less than or equal to the thumbnail width.

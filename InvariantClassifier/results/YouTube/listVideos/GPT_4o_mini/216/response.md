### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`. It includes a query parameter `maxHeight` which is an optional integer with a minimum value of 72. The response for a successful request (HTTP 200) includes a `pageInfo` object that contains `totalResults`, which is an integer representing the total number of results available.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxHeight > return.pageInfo.totalResults`, which means that the value of `maxHeight` provided in the request must always be greater than the total number of results returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding `maxHeight`:** The `maxHeight` parameter is used to filter the results based on height. It does not inherently relate to the number of results returned. For example, if there are 100 videos available, the `totalResults` could be 100 regardless of the `maxHeight` value.

2. **Understanding `totalResults`:** The `totalResults` indicates how many items match the query criteria, which can be influenced by other parameters or the state of the database. It is possible for `totalResults` to be less than or equal to `maxHeight` if, for instance, there are fewer videos than the specified height.

3. **Counterexample:** If a user sets `maxHeight` to 200 and there are only 150 videos available that match the criteria, then `maxHeight` (200) is greater than `totalResults` (150). This violates the invariant.

### Conclusion
The invariant `input.maxHeight > return.pageInfo.totalResults` does not hold true for all valid requests to the API. There are scenarios where the total number of results can be equal to or less than the `maxHeight`, making this invariant incorrect. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The `part` parameter is required and specifies which properties of the video resource to include in the response. The response schema indicates that the `contentDetails` object contains a `regionRestriction` property, which in turn has a `blocked` array that lists region codes where the video is blocked.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `input.part` array is not equal to the size of the `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked` array minus one. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

`size(input.part) != size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked) - 1`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the `part` parameter**: The `part` parameter is an array that specifies which properties of the video resource to include in the response. The number of elements in this array can vary based on the request made by the client.
2. **Understanding the `blocked` array**: The `blocked` array within `regionRestriction` indicates the countries where the video is blocked. This array can also vary in size depending on the specific video being queried.
3. **Evaluating the invariant**: The invariant suggests a specific relationship between the size of the `part` array and the `blocked` array. However, there is no inherent relationship defined in the API documentation that connects the number of requested properties (in `part`) to the number of blocked regions (in `blocked`). The sizes of these two arrays can be completely independent of each other. For example, if `input.part` has 3 elements and `blocked` has 2 elements, the invariant would hold true. But if `input.part` has 2 elements and `blocked` has 2 elements, the invariant would not hold. Thus, the invariant does not consistently hold for all valid requests.

### Conclusion
Given that the sizes of `input.part` and `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked` are independent and can vary independently based on the request and the video being queried, the invariant is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response schema indicates that each video can have a `contentDetails` object, which may include a `regionRestriction` object. The `regionRestriction` object has a `blocked` property, which is an array of strings representing countries where the video is blocked.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `blocked` array must be greater than or equal to 1: `size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) >= 1`. This implies that every response will have at least one country listed in the `blocked` array.

### Analysis
According to the Swagger definition, the `blocked` property can be present and contain an empty list, which indicates that the video is viewable in all countries. Therefore, it is possible for the `blocked` array to be empty or even absent in the response. This means that the invariant `size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) >= 1` does not hold for every valid request, as there are valid responses where the `blocked` array is empty or not included at all.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not hold for all valid responses, it is classified as a false-positive.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided excerpt from the Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`. It specifies that the response will include a `pageInfo` object, which contains a property `resultsPerPage`. This property is defined as an integer, and its description indicates that it represents the number of results included in the API response.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 0`. This means that the `resultsPerPage` value in the API response is expected to be zero or greater.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding `resultsPerPage`:** The `resultsPerPage` property indicates how many results are returned in a single API response. It logically cannot be negative because it represents a count of items.
2. **Possible Values:** Since `resultsPerPage` is defined as an integer, the minimum value it can take is 0. A value of 0 would indicate that no results are returned in the current page, which is a valid scenario for an API that retrieves lists of resources.
3. **API Behavior:** In typical REST API design, when there are no items to return, the API may return a `resultsPerPage` of 0, which aligns with the invariant. Therefore, the invariant `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 0` is consistent with the expected behavior of the API.

### Conclusion
Given that `resultsPerPage` is an integer representing the count of results returned and cannot logically be negative, the invariant `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 0` is correct and holds for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

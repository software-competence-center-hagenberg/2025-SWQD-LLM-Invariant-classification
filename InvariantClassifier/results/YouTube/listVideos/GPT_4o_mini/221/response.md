### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The query parameter `maxWidth` is an optional integer that specifies the maximum height of the player, with a minimum value of 72. The response includes a `pageInfo` object, which contains `totalResults`, an integer representing the total number of results available.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxWidth > return.pageInfo.totalResults`. This means that the value of `maxWidth` provided in the request must always be greater than the total number of results returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding `maxWidth`:** The `maxWidth` parameter is intended to control the display size of the video player, but it does not inherently relate to the number of video resources available. It is simply a display parameter.
2. **Understanding `totalResults`:** The `totalResults` field indicates how many video resources match the request criteria. This number can vary based on the filters applied, and it can be zero if no resources match the criteria.
3. **Logical Relationship:** There is no logical relationship that guarantees `maxWidth` will always be greater than `totalResults`. For instance, if there are no results (i.e., `totalResults = 0`), then `maxWidth` could be any value greater than 72, and the invariant would hold. However, if `totalResults` is a positive integer, it is entirely possible for `maxWidth` to be less than or equal to `totalResults`, especially since `maxWidth` is not constrained by any upper limit in relation to `totalResults`.

### Conclusion
The invariant `input.maxWidth > return.pageInfo.totalResults` does not hold true for every valid request to the API. There are scenarios where `maxWidth` can be less than or equal to `totalResults`, making this invariant incorrect. Therefore, the classification of this invariant is **false-positive**.

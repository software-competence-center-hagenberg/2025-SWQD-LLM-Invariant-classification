### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources based on the specified `part` parameter. The `part` parameter is required and specifies which properties of the video resource should be included in the response. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an `items` array, where each item has a `snippet` object that includes a `thumbnails` object, which in turn contains a `standard` object with a `width` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `width` of the `standard` thumbnail in the response must be greater than the size of the `input.part` array. In other words, it asserts that `return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width > size(input.part[])`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding `input.part[]`:** The `input.part[]` refers to the number of properties requested in the `part` parameter. This can vary depending on the user's request. For example, if a user requests `part=snippet`, the size of `input.part[]` would be 1. If they request `part=snippet,contentDetails`, the size would be 2.

2. **Understanding `return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width`:** The `width` of the thumbnail is a property that is defined in the response schema. The actual value of `width` is not specified in the Swagger definition and can vary based on the video being retrieved.

3. **Potential Scenarios:** 
   - If the `width` of the thumbnail is, for example, 120 and the user requests `part=snippet`, then the invariant holds true (120 > 1).
   - However, if the `width` is 1 and the user requests `part=snippet,contentDetails`, then the invariant does not hold (1 is not greater than 2).
   - Additionally, if the `width` is 0 (which is possible if there are no thumbnails available), the invariant would also fail for any non-zero size of `input.part[]`.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.snippet.thumbnails.standard.width > size(input.part[])` does not hold for every valid request on the API. There are scenarios where the width of the thumbnail could be less than or equal to the size of the `input.part[]`, making this invariant a false-positive.

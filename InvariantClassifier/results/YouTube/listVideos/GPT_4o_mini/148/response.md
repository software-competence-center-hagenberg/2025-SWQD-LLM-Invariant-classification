### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The `part` parameter is required and specifies which properties of the video resource to include in the response. The response schema indicates that each video resource will include a `snippet` object, which contains a `thumbnails` object with a `default` property that has a `width` attribute.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the width of the default thumbnail (`return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width`) must be greater than the size of the input array `input.part[]`. This is expressed as:

`return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width > size(input.part[])`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant compares the width of a thumbnail image to the size of the `part` parameter array. The `part` parameter can include multiple properties, and its size can vary depending on the request.
2. **Possible Values**: The width of the thumbnail (`return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width`) is a property that is determined by the video resource and is not directly related to the number of properties requested in the `part` parameter. The width is a fixed value defined by the API for each video resource, while the size of `input.part[]` can vary from request to request.
3. **Counterexamples**: It is possible for the width of the thumbnail to be less than or equal to the size of the `part` parameter. For example, if `input.part[]` contains 5 elements and the width of the thumbnail is 120 pixels, the invariant would not hold true (120 is not greater than 5).

### Conclusion
Since the width of the thumbnail can be less than or equal to the size of the `part` array, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

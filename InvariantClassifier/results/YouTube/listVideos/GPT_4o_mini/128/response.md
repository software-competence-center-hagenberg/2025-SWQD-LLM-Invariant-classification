### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an array of items, each of which may include `contentDetails` and `liveStreamingDetails`. 

- **contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked**: This is an array of strings that lists the region codes where the video is blocked. If this property is present and contains an empty list, the video is viewable in all countries.
- **liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime**: This is a string that represents the time when a live broadcast actually ended. This value is only available after the broadcast has concluded.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`. 

### Analysis
1. **Nature of `actualEndTime`**: The `actualEndTime` is a timestamp indicating when a live stream ended. It is not a region code; it is a string formatted as a date-time.
2. **Nature of `blocked[]`**: The `blocked` array contains region codes, which are also strings but represent geographical locations (e.g., 'US', 'CA'). 
3. **Membership**: For the invariant to hold true, every possible value of `actualEndTime` would need to be a valid entry in the `blocked` array. However, since `actualEndTime` represents a time and `blocked` represents region codes, there is no overlap between these two types of data. 

### Conclusion
Since `actualEndTime` cannot be a member of `blocked[]` due to their fundamentally different purposes and formats, the invariant is incorrect. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

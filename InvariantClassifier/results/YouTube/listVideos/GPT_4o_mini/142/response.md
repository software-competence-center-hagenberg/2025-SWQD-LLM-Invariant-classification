### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response includes a property `items`, which is an array of video resources, each containing a `snippet` object. Within the `snippet`, there is a `thumbnails` object that contains a `default` property, which is itself an object that includes a `height` property.

The `part` parameter is required and specifies which properties of the video resource to include in the response. The invariant in question compares the `height` of the default thumbnail to the size of the `part` parameter array.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `height` of the default thumbnail (`return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height`) must be greater than the size of the `part` parameter array (`size(input.part[])`).

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests a relationship between the height of a thumbnail and the number of properties requested via the `part` parameter. However, there is no inherent relationship defined in the API specification that connects the height of a thumbnail to the number of requested properties. 

2. **Possible Values**: The `height` of the thumbnail can vary independently of the `part` parameter size. For example, if `part` includes only one property, the size would be 1, but the height of the thumbnail could be any integer value, including values less than or equal to 1. 

3. **Counterexample**: If the `part` parameter is set to `snippet` (which has a size of 1), and the height of the thumbnail is 0 or 1, the invariant would not hold true as `0 > 1` or `1 > 1` is false.

### Conclusion
The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API because the relationship it asserts is not supported by the API's structure or logic. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

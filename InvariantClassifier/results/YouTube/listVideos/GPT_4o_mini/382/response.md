### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will be an object containing an array of items, where each item has a `status` object. Within this `status` object, there is a property `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` of type boolean.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids == true`. This means that for every item in the response, the `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` property is expected to be true.

### Analysis
The property `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` is defined as a boolean, which means it can take on two possible values: `true` or `false`. The invariant asserts that this property will always be `true` for every item in the response. However, the Swagger definition does not impose any constraints that would guarantee that `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` can only be `true`. It is entirely possible for some items to have `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` set to `false` or even for it to be omitted in some cases, depending on the implementation of the API and the data it retrieves.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant requires that `selfDeclaredMadeForKids` is always `true`, but the definition allows for it to be `false`, this invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

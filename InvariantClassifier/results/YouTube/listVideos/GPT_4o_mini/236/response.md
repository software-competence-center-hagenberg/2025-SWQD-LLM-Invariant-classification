### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response contains an array of items, each of which may include a property `liveStreamingDetails`. This property contains a sub-property `actualEndTime`, which is described as a string representing the time that the broadcast actually ended.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the string `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime` is always equal to 20 characters. This is represented as `LENGTH(return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime) == 20`.

### Analysis
The description of `actualEndTime` suggests that it is a string representing a timestamp. However, the format of this timestamp is not specified in the Swagger definition. Common timestamp formats include ISO 8601, which typically has a length of 20 characters (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`), but this is not guaranteed. Additionally, if the broadcast has not ended, the `actualEndTime` may not be present at all, which could lead to it being `null` or an empty string.

Given that the length of a string can vary based on its format and that the property may not be present, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request. 

### Conclusion
The invariant `LENGTH(return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime) == 20` is a false-positive because it assumes a fixed length for a string that may vary in length or may not be present in the response at all.

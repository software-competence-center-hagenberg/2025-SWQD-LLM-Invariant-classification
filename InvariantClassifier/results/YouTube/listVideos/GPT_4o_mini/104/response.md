### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. The response includes a schema with properties such as `items`, `contentDetails`, and `regionRestriction`. The `regionRestriction` object has an `allowed` property that is an array of strings representing country codes where the video is viewable. The `player` object contains an `embedWidth` property, which is a string representing the width of the video player.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.player.embedWidth` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]`. This means that the embed width of the video player is expected to be one of the allowed region codes where the video can be viewed.

### Analysis
1. **Nature of Properties**: The `embedWidth` property is a string that represents the width of the video player, while the `allowed` property is an array of strings that represent country codes. These two properties are fundamentally different in nature and purpose.
2. **Logical Relationship**: There is no logical connection or requirement in the API definition that states the embed width of the player must correspond to any of the region codes. The embed width is a property related to the video player, while the allowed region codes are related to the geographical restrictions of the video.
3. **Possible Values**: The `embedWidth` can take on various string values (e.g., "640", "1280", etc.), which do not correlate with the country codes (e.g., "US", "CA", etc.) in the `allowed` array. Therefore, it is entirely possible for the `embedWidth` to not be present in the `allowed` array.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant that `return.player.embedWidth` is a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]` is incorrect. The two properties are unrelated, and there is no guarantee that the embed width will ever match any of the allowed region codes. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that retrieves a list of YouTube videos. The response schema indicates that each video has two main properties of interest: `contentDetails` and `snippet`. 

- `contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked`: This is an array that lists the region codes where the video is blocked. If this property is present and contains an empty list, it indicates that the video is viewable in all countries. 
- `snippet.tags`: This is an array that contains keyword tags associated with the video. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `blocked` array (from `contentDetails.regionRestriction`) is not equal to the size of the `tags` array (from `snippet`). 

### Analysis
The invariant asserts that the number of blocked regions for a video will always differ from the number of tags associated with that video. However, this is not necessarily true. 
- A video could have no tags (i.e., `tags` array is empty) and have a non-empty `blocked` array, which would satisfy the invariant. 
- Conversely, a video could have a number of tags equal to the number of blocked regions, thereby violating the invariant. 
- Additionally, a video could have both arrays empty, which would also violate the invariant. 

Since there are scenarios where the sizes of these two arrays can be equal (e.g., both are empty or both have the same number of elements), the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API. 

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it does not hold true for all possible responses from the API. There are valid cases where the sizes of `blocked` and `tags` can be equal, thus violating the invariant.

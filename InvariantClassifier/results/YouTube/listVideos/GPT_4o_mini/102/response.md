### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an array of items, each with properties such as `contentDetails` and `player`. The `contentDetails` includes a `regionRestriction` object, which has an `allowed` property that is an array of strings representing country codes where the video is viewable. The `player` object contains an `embedHeight` property, which is a string representing the height of the video player.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.player.embedHeight` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]`. This implies that the value of `embedHeight` must be one of the country codes listed in the `allowed` array.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**: The `embedHeight` property is related to the video player and is not logically connected to the `allowed` array of country codes. The `allowed` array is meant to specify which countries can view the video, while `embedHeight` is a property of the video player configuration.
2. **Logical Connection**: There is no inherent relationship between a video's player height and the countries where the video is allowed to be viewed. The `embedHeight` is a string that represents a dimension (e.g., "720") and does not correspond to any country code.
3. **Possible Values**: The `allowed` array can contain values like "US", "CA", etc., which are country codes, while `embedHeight` can contain values like "720", "1080", etc. These two sets of values are fundamentally different and do not overlap.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant that `return.player.embedHeight` is a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]` is incorrect. There is no logical basis for this relationship, and therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

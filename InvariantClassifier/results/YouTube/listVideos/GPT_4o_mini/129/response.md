### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. Each video resource can contain various details, including `contentDetails` and `liveStreamingDetails`. The `contentDetails` includes a `regionRestriction` object that has a `blocked` property, which is an array of country codes where the video is blocked. The `liveStreamingDetails` includes an `actualStartTime` property that indicates when a live broadcast actually started.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualStartTime` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`. This means that the actual start time of a live stream is expected to be one of the country codes listed in the blocked regions.

### Analysis
1. **Nature of the Properties**: The `actualStartTime` is a string representing a timestamp, while the `blocked` property is an array of strings representing country codes. These two types of data are fundamentally different in nature.
2. **Logical Relationship**: There is no logical relationship that would imply that a timestamp (when a live stream starts) would ever be a member of an array of country codes (which indicate where the video is blocked). The invariant suggests a relationship that does not exist based on the definitions provided in the Swagger.
3. **Possible Scenarios**: In a valid response, `actualStartTime` could be any valid timestamp string, while `blocked` could contain country codes like "US", "CA", etc. There is no scenario where a timestamp would match any of these country codes.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant is incorrect as it suggests an impossible relationship between two unrelated data types. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

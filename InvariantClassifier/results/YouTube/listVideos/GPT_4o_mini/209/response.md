### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`. The response for this request is expected to return an object that includes a `pageInfo` property. The `pageInfo` property is described as containing paging details for lists of resources, which implies that it should be present in the response when the request is successful.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.pageInfo != null`, which means that the `pageInfo` property in the response should never be null.

### Analysis
Given that the Swagger definition indicates that the response will include a `pageInfo` object, it is reasonable to conclude that `pageInfo` should not be null in a successful response (HTTP status 200). However, it is important to consider edge cases or error scenarios that might not be covered in the provided definition. For instance, if there are no videos available, the API might still return a response with an empty list, but `pageInfo` could still be present and not null. 

However, if the API were to encounter an error or if the request was malformed, the response might not include `pageInfo` at all, potentially leading to a situation where `return.pageInfo` could be null. Since the invariant does not account for all possible scenarios, it cannot be guaranteed that `return.pageInfo` will always be non-null for every valid request.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.pageInfo != null` is not guaranteed to hold true for every valid request on the API, especially in cases of errors or unexpected responses. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

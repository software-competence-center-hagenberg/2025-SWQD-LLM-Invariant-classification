### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `pageInfo` object containing a `totalResults` property, which is an integer representing the total number of results available.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.pageInfo.totalResults >= 1`, which implies that the API will always return at least one result when a valid request is made.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding `totalResults`:** The `totalResults` property indicates the total number of items available in the result set. It does not guarantee that there will always be at least one item returned. 
2. **Possible Scenarios:** 
   - If there are no videos that match the request criteria, the API could return a `totalResults` of 0, indicating that there are no available results. 
   - The API could also return an empty list of resources while still providing a `totalResults` of 0.
3. **Conclusion from Analysis:** Since the invariant assumes that `totalResults` will always be at least 1, it does not account for scenarios where there are no matching resources, which is a valid case for this API.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.pageInfo.totalResults >= 1` is a false-positive because it does not hold for every valid request on the API. The API can return a `totalResults` of 0 when there are no resources available, contradicting the invariant.

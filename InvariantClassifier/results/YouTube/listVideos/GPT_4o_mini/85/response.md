### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The request can include a query parameter `maxWidth`, which is an integer that specifies the maximum height of the player. The response contains an array of video items, each with a `snippet` that includes a `thumbnails` object. The `default` thumbnail has a `height` property, which is also an integer.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the value of `input.maxWidth` must be greater than the value of `return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height`. This is represented as `input.maxWidth > return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Parameters**: The `maxWidth` parameter is intended to control the maximum height of the player, but it does not directly correlate with the height of the thumbnail images returned in the response. The height of the thumbnail is independent of the `maxWidth` parameter.
2. **Possible Values**: The `maxWidth` can be set to any integer greater than or equal to 72, while the height of the thumbnail can vary based on the video and is not constrained by the `maxWidth` parameter. Therefore, it is possible for the thumbnail height to exceed the `maxWidth` value.
3. **Counterexample**: For instance, if `maxWidth` is set to 100 and the thumbnail height is 120, the invariant `input.maxWidth > return.snippet.thumbnails.default.height` would not hold true, as 100 is not greater than 120.

### Conclusion
The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API because the relationship between `maxWidth` and the thumbnail height is not guaranteed. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

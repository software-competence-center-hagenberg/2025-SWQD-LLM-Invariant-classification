### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos, including their content details and statistics. The response schema indicates that each video item can have properties such as `contentDetails` and `statistics`. 

- **contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked**: This is an array of region codes where the video is blocked. If this property is present and empty, the video is viewable in all countries. 
- **statistics.dislikeCount**: This is a string representing the number of dislikes a video has received. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `dislikeCount` (a string scalar) is always a member of the `blocked` array (a sequence of strings). 

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that the number of dislikes a video has received is somehow related to the regions where the video is blocked. However, there is no logical connection between the two properties:
- `dislikeCount` is a metric indicating user feedback on the video, while `blocked` is a list of region codes indicating where the video cannot be viewed. 
- The `blocked` array contains region codes (like "US", "CA", etc.), whereas `dislikeCount` is a numeric string that represents a count of dislikes, which cannot be a member of an array of region codes. 

### Conclusion
Since `dislikeCount` cannot logically be a member of the `blocked` array, the invariant is incorrect. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

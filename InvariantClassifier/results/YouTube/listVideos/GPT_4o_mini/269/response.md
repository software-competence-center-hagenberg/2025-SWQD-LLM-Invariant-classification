### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource contains a `player` object, which has properties `embedHtml` (a string containing an HTML iframe tag) and `embedWidth` (a string representing the width of the embed).

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.player.embedWidth` is a substring of `return.player.embedHtml`. This means that the value of `embedWidth` should appear within the `embedHtml` string.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**: The `embedHtml` property is expected to contain an HTML iframe tag, which typically includes attributes such as `width`. The `embedWidth` property is a string that represents the width of the video player. 
2. **Possible Values**: The `embedHtml` might look something like this: `<iframe width="560" height="315" src="..." frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>`. The `embedWidth` might simply be the string "560". 
3. **Substring Relationship**: In this case, `embedWidth` could indeed be a substring of `embedHtml` if the width is included in the iframe tag. However, this is not guaranteed. For example, if `embedWidth` is set to a value that is not included in the `embedHtml` (e.g., `"300"`), then the invariant would not hold. 
4. **Variability**: The content of `embedHtml` can vary significantly based on how the video is embedded, and there is no strict requirement that the `embedWidth` must be included in the `embedHtml` string. 

### Conclusion
Given that the relationship between `embedWidth` and `embedHtml` is not guaranteed and can vary based on the implementation of the video embedding, the invariant that `return.player.embedWidth` is a substring of `return.player.embedHtml` does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

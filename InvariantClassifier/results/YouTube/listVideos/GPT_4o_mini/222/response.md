### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The query parameter `maxWidth` is an optional integer that specifies the maximum height for the player, with a minimum value of 72 and a maximum length of 8192. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an array of video resources under the `items` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxWidth > size(return.items[])`, meaning that the value of `maxWidth` must be greater than the number of items returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding `maxWidth`**: The `maxWidth` parameter is intended to control the maximum height of the player, not the number of items returned. It does not have a direct relationship with the size of the `items` array in the response.
2. **Response Size**: The size of the `items` array can vary based on the request and the filtering applied. It could be 0 (no items returned), 1, or more, depending on the available videos that match the criteria.
3. **Logical Relationship**: There is no inherent logical relationship that guarantees `maxWidth` will always be greater than the number of items returned. For instance, if `maxWidth` is set to 100 and no videos match the criteria, the size of `return.items[]` could be 0, which does not satisfy the invariant. Conversely, if `maxWidth` is set to 1 and the API returns 1 or more items, the invariant would be violated.

### Conclusion
The invariant is not universally valid because the relationship between `maxWidth` and the size of `return.items[]` is not guaranteed. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

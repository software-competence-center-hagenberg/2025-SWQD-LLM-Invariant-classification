### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving videos from the YouTube API. The relevant parameters and response structure are as follows:

- **Parameters**:
  - `id`: An optional query parameter that can take an array of video IDs.

- **Response**:
  - The response contains an object with an `items` array, where each item has a `contentDetails` object. This object includes a `regionRestriction` property, which has a `blocked` property that is an array of strings representing region codes where the video is blocked.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the input array `input.id[]` must divide the size of the output array `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]` without a remainder:

`size(input.id[]) % size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) == 0`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the number of video IDs requested should evenly divide the number of blocked regions returned. This implies a relationship between the number of IDs in the request and the number of blocked regions in the response.

2. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If no IDs are provided (`input.id[]` is empty), the invariant would evaluate to `0 % size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]) == 0`, which is not defined if `blocked[]` is also empty, leading to a division by zero scenario.
   - If one ID is provided and there are no blocked regions, the invariant would evaluate to `1 % 0`, which is also undefined.
   - If multiple IDs are provided, the invariant could hold true in some cases but not universally, as the number of blocked regions can vary independently of the number of IDs.

3. **Independence of Parameters**: The number of video IDs requested does not inherently correlate with the number of regions where a video is blocked. The API could return any number of blocked regions regardless of how many IDs are requested, making the invariant unreliable.

### Conclusion
Given the independence of the input and output sizes, and the potential for division by zero, the invariant does not hold true for all valid requests. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
      - name: part
        in: query
        description: The *part* parameter specifies a comma-separated list of one or more video resource properties that the API response will include. If the parameter identifies a property that contains child properties, the child properties will be included in the response. For example, in a video resource, the snippet property contains the channelId, title, description, tags, and categoryId properties. As such, if you set *part=snippet*, the API response will contain all of those properties.
        required: true
        type: array
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                snippet:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video, including title, description, uploader, thumbnails and category.
                  properties:
                    thumbnails:
                      type: object
                      description: Internal representation of thumbnails for a YouTube resource.
                      properties:
                        maxres:
                          type: object
                          description: A thumbnail is an image representing a YouTube resource.
                          properties:
                            height:
                              type: integer
                              description: (Optional) Height of the thumbnail image.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.height > size(input.part[])

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of > between two long scalars. Prints as x > y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos, with an optional query parameter `maxHeight`. The `maxHeight` parameter is an integer that can be set by the user, with a minimum value of 72. The response schema indicates that the response will include an array of items, each containing `contentDetails`, which in turn includes a deprecated property `regionRestriction`. This property has a `blocked` field that is an array of strings representing region codes where the video is blocked.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxHeight > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`. This means that the value of `maxHeight` must be greater than the number of region codes listed in the `blocked` array of the `regionRestriction` object in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the `maxHeight` Parameter**: The `maxHeight` parameter is a user-defined value that can be set to any integer greater than or equal to 72. There is no upper limit defined in the Swagger for `maxHeight`, but it is constrained by the maximum length of 8192, which is likely a mistake since it should refer to the maximum value instead of length.

2. **Understanding the `blocked` Array**: The `blocked` array can be empty, meaning the video is viewable in all countries, or it can contain multiple region codes. The size of this array can vary significantly based on the video.

3. **Evaluating the Invariant**: The invariant asserts that the user-defined `maxHeight` must always be greater than the size of the `blocked` array. However, if the `blocked` array is empty (which is a valid scenario), the size would be 0. In this case, the invariant would hold true for any `maxHeight` value greater than 0. However, if the `blocked` array contains multiple entries, the invariant may not hold true if `maxHeight` is set to a value less than or equal to the size of the `blocked` array. For example, if `maxHeight` is set to 3 and the `blocked` array has 4 entries, the invariant would not hold.

### Conclusion
The invariant is not universally valid because there are scenarios where `maxHeight` can be less than or equal to the size of the `blocked` array, particularly when the `blocked` array has multiple entries. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

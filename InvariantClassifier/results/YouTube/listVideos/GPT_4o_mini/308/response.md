### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema specifies that the response will include an `items` array, where each item contains a `contentDetails` object. Within this object, there is a `projection` property that is defined as a string with an enumeration of possible values: `rectangular` and `360`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.contentDetails.projection` must be one of the values: `"360"` or `"rectangular"`. This is represented as an invariant of type `daikon.inv.unary.string.OneOfString`.

### Analysis
Given the Swagger definition, the `projection` property is explicitly defined to only accept the values `rectangular` and `360`. This means that any valid response from the API that includes the `projection` field will indeed be one of these two values. Therefore, the invariant correctly reflects the constraints set by the Swagger definition.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant accurately describes the possible values for the `projection` field as defined in the Swagger documentation, it is a correct statement that holds for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

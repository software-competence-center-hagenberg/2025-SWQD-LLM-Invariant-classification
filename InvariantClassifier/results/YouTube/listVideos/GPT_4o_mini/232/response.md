### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response schema indicates that the response contains an array of items, each with a `contentDetails` object. Within `contentDetails`, there is a `regionRestriction` object that may contain a `blocked` property, which is an array of strings representing country codes.

### Invariant
The invariant states that all elements of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]` have LENGTH=2. This means that every string in the `blocked` array must consist of exactly 2 characters.

### Analysis
The `blocked` property is described as an array of strings that represent region codes. In the context of country codes, it is common to use ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes, which are indeed 2-letter codes (e.g., 'US' for the United States, 'CA' for Canada). However, the invariant does not account for the possibility that the `blocked` array could be empty or that it could contain invalid or non-standard codes that do not adhere to the 2-character length requirement. Furthermore, the description states that if the `blocked` property is present and contains an empty list, the video is viewable in all countries, which means that the `blocked` array could also be empty, thus not satisfying the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant requires all elements of the `blocked` array to have a length of 2, and considering that the array can be empty (which does not violate the invariant), the invariant cannot be classified as universally true for all valid responses. Therefore, the invariant is a **false-positive**.

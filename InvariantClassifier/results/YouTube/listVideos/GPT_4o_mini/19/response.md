### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource has a `contentDetails` object, which includes a `regionRestriction` object. This `regionRestriction` object has an `allowed` property, which is an array of strings representing country codes where the video is viewable. The description specifies that if the `allowed` property is present and contains an empty list, the video is blocked in all countries.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `allowed` array can only contain specific country codes, and it lists two sets of country codes that are allowed. 

### Analysis
1. **Allowed Values**: The invariant suggests that the `allowed` array can only contain values from the specified sets of country codes. However, the Swagger definition does not restrict the `allowed` array to these specific values. It only states that the `allowed` property is an array of strings, which means it can contain any string values, not just the ones listed in the invariant.
2. **Empty List**: The invariant does not account for the possibility of the `allowed` array being empty, which is a valid state according to the Swagger definition. An empty `allowed` array means the video is blocked in all countries, which contradicts the invariant that requires at least one of the specified country codes.
3. **Flexibility of Values**: The `allowed` array can potentially include country codes not listed in the invariant, making the invariant overly restrictive.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant incorrectly assumes that the `allowed` array can only contain specific values and does not account for the possibility of an empty array, it does not hold true for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

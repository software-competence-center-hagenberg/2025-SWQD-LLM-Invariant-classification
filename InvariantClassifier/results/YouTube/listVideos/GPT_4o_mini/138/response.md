### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response is an object containing an `items` array. Each item in this array can have properties such as `liveStreamingDetails` and `topicDetails`. 

- `liveStreamingDetails` includes `actualStartTime`, which is a string that represents the time the broadcast actually started. This value is only available once the broadcast begins.
- `topicDetails` includes `topicCategories`, which is an array of strings representing Wikipedia URLs related to the video's content.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualStartTime` is always a member of `return.topicDetails.topicCategories[]`. This means that the actual start time of the live stream should always be found within the list of topic categories associated with the video.

### Analysis
1. **Nature of Data**: The `actualStartTime` is a timestamp indicating when a live broadcast starts, while `topicCategories` contains URLs that describe the video's content. These two pieces of data are fundamentally different in nature. 
2. **Independence of Fields**: There is no indication in the Swagger definition that `actualStartTime` would ever be included in `topicCategories`. The `topicCategories` are meant to provide context about the video's content, not to include timestamps or any other unrelated data. 
3. **Conditional Availability**: The `actualStartTime` is only available when the broadcast has started, which adds another layer of complexity. If the broadcast has not started, `actualStartTime` may not even be present in the response, making it impossible for it to be a member of `topicCategories` at that time.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant is a **false-positive**. The `actualStartTime` cannot be guaranteed to be a member of `topicCategories`, as they serve different purposes and are not related in the context of the API's response structure.

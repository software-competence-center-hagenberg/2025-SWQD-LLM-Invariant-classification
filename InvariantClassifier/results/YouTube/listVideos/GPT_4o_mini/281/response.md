### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response schema includes an array of items, where each item can have properties such as `contentDetails` and `liveStreamingDetails`. 

- **contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked**: This is an array of strings representing countries where the video is blocked. If this property is present and contains an empty list, it indicates that the video is viewable in all countries.
- **liveStreamingDetails.activeLiveChatId**: This is a string that represents the ID of the currently active live chat for a live broadcast video. This field is only populated if the video is currently live.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `activeLiveChatId` (from `liveStreamingDetails`) is always a member of the `blocked` array (from `regionRestriction`). 

### Analysis
1. **Context of `activeLiveChatId`**: The `activeLiveChatId` is only present when the video is currently live. If the video is not live, this field will not be included in the response.
2. **Context of `blocked`**: The `blocked` array contains country codes where the video is restricted. It does not relate to the `activeLiveChatId` in any meaningful way. The `activeLiveChatId` is an identifier for a chat session, while `blocked` contains geographical restrictions.
3. **Logical Relationship**: There is no logical relationship that would imply that a chat ID (which is a string identifier) would ever be a member of an array that contains country codes (which are also strings but represent entirely different concepts).

### Conclusion
The invariant is incorrect because there is no scenario in which `activeLiveChatId` can be a member of the `blocked` array. The two fields represent different types of information and are not related. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

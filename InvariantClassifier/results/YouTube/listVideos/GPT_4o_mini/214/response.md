### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving videos from the YouTube API. The endpoint accepts an optional query parameter `id`, which is an array of video IDs, and returns a response that includes a `nextPageToken` field.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.nextPageToken` is always a member of the input array `input.id[]`. This suggests that the `nextPageToken` returned in the response should always be one of the IDs provided in the request.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Parameters and Response**: The `id` parameter is used to filter the videos returned by the API. The `nextPageToken` is a string that allows the client to fetch the next set of results, but it does not imply that this token is related to the IDs provided in the request. The `nextPageToken` is typically used for pagination and does not need to correspond to any of the video IDs in the `id` array.

2. **Nature of `nextPageToken`**: The `nextPageToken` is meant to facilitate pagination and is not guaranteed to be one of the IDs passed in the `id` parameter. It is possible that the API could return a `nextPageToken` even if the `id` array is empty or does not contain the token.

3. **Conclusion**: Since the `nextPageToken` does not have to be a member of the `input.id[]` array, the invariant is incorrect. The invariant implies a relationship between the request IDs and the pagination token that does not exist according to the API's design.

### Conclusion
The invariant is classified as a **false-positive** because `return.nextPageToken` does not have to be a member of `input.id[]` for every valid request on the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response schema indicates that each video resource can contain various details, including `contentDetails` and `liveStreamingDetails`. 

- `contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed`: This property is an array of strings representing the countries where the video is viewable. If this property is present and contains an empty list, it means the video is blocked in all countries.
- `liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime`: This property is a string that indicates when a live broadcast is scheduled to end. If it is empty or not present, it means the broadcast is scheduled to continue indefinitely.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]`. This implies that the scheduled end time of a live stream must correspond to a country where the video is allowed to be viewed.

### Analysis
1. **Logical Relationship**: The invariant suggests a direct relationship between the scheduled end time of a live stream and the allowed regions for viewing the video. However, these two properties serve different purposes and are not inherently related. The `scheduledEndTime` is about the timing of the broadcast, while `regionRestriction.allowed` pertains to geographical access.
2. **Presence of Properties**: The `scheduledEndTime` can be empty or absent, indicating that the broadcast continues indefinitely. In such cases, it cannot be a member of any array, including `regionRestriction.allowed[]`.
3. **Data Types**: The `scheduledEndTime` is a string representing a time, while `regionRestriction.allowed` is an array of strings representing country codes. There is no logical way for a time string to be a member of an array of country codes.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant is incorrect as it assumes a relationship between two unrelated properties. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

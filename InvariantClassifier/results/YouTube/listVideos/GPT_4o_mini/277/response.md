### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response schema indicates that each video has a `contentDetails` object, which includes a `regionRestriction` object. This `regionRestriction` object has an `allowed` property, which is an array of strings representing country codes where the video is viewable. The description specifies that if the `allowed` property is present and contains an empty list, the video is blocked in all countries.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `allowed` array in the `regionRestriction` object must be one of the values: {9, 80, 94}. This means that the `allowed` array can only have 9, 80, or 94 elements.

### Analysis
The `allowed` array can theoretically have any number of elements, including 0 (if it is present and empty, meaning the video is blocked in all countries). The invariant does not account for the possibility of the `allowed` array being empty or having a size other than 9, 80, or 94. Therefore, the invariant is too restrictive and does not hold for all valid responses from the API. For instance, if a video is blocked in all countries, the `allowed` array would have a size of 0, which is not included in the invariant's specified sizes.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant does not account for the possibility of the `allowed` array being empty or having sizes outside of {9, 80, 94}, it is incorrect. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

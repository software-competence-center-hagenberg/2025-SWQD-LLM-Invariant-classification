### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an `items` array, where each item has a `contentDetails` object. Within this object, there is a property called `definition`, which is a string that can take on specific values.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.contentDetails.definition` must be one of the values { "hd", "sd" }. This means that for any valid response from this API endpoint, the `definition` field should only contain either "hd" (high definition) or "sd" (standard definition).

### Analysis
According to the Swagger definition, the `definition` property is explicitly defined with an `enum` that restricts its values to only "sd" and "hd". This means that every valid response from the API will indeed have the `definition` field set to one of these two values. There are no other possible values for `definition` as per the API specification. Therefore, the invariant accurately reflects the constraints imposed by the Swagger definition.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant correctly captures the allowed values for the `definition` field as specified in the Swagger definition, it is classified as a true-positive. The invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

    parameters:
    responses:

        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                suggestions:

                      items:

                  properties:
                    processingWarnings:
                      type: array
                      description: A list of reasons why YouTube may have difficulty transcoding the uploaded video or that might result in an erroneous transcoding. These warnings are generated before YouTube actually processes the uploaded video file. In addition, they identify issues that are unlikely to cause the video processing to fail but that might cause problems such as sync issues, video artifacts, or a missing audio track.
                      items:
                        type: string

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an `items` array, where each item has a `fileDetails` object. Within `fileDetails`, there is an `audioStreams` property that is an array containing metadata about audio streams in the video file.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.fileDetails.audioStreams == null`, which suggests that the `audioStreams` property will always be null in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Response Structure**: According to the Swagger definition, `audioStreams` is defined as an array of objects. This implies that it can either contain an array of audio stream objects or be an empty array. The definition does not indicate that `audioStreams` can be null; rather, it suggests that it will be present as an array (which could be empty).
2. **Possible Values of `audioStreams`**: Given that `audioStreams` is an array, it can take on several forms: it can be an empty array (`[]`), or it can contain one or more audio stream objects. The invariant states that it will be null, which contradicts the definition provided in the Swagger documentation.
3. **Conclusion from the Analysis**: Since the Swagger definition does not support the possibility of `audioStreams` being null and instead indicates that it will be an array, the invariant `return.fileDetails.audioStreams == null` cannot hold true for every valid request to the API.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because the Swagger definition indicates that `audioStreams` will be an array (which can be empty) and does not support the notion that it can be null.

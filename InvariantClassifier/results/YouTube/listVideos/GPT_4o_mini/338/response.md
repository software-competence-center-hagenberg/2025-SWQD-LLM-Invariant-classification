### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource can include `contentDetails` and `liveStreamingDetails`. 

- **contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked**: This property is an array of strings that lists the region codes where the video is blocked. If this property is present and contains an empty list, it indicates that the video is viewable in all countries.
- **liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime**: This property is a string that indicates when a live broadcast is scheduled to end. If it is empty or not present, the broadcast is scheduled to continue indefinitely.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`. 

### Analysis
To evaluate the invariant, we need to consider the meanings of the two properties:
- The `scheduledEndTime` indicates when a live stream is expected to end, which is independent of the regions where the video may be blocked. 
- The `blocked` array contains region codes where the video is not available. 

There is no logical connection between the `scheduledEndTime` of a live stream and the `blocked` regions. For instance, a video could have a `scheduledEndTime` of "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z" while being blocked in certain regions, or it could be viewable in all regions (empty `blocked` array). Therefore, it is entirely possible for `scheduledEndTime` to not be a member of the `blocked` array, as they represent different concepts.

### Conclusion
The invariant is incorrect because the `scheduledEndTime` does not have to be a member of the `blocked` array. The two properties are unrelated, leading to the conclusion that the invariant is a false-positive.

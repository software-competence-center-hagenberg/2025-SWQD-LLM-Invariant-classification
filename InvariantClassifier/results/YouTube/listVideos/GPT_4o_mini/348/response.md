### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of videos from the YouTube API. The response contains an array of video items, each with a `snippet` and `contentDetails`. The `snippet` includes a `thumbnails` object, which has a `default` thumbnail with a `width` property. The `contentDetails` includes a `regionRestriction` object that has a `blocked` property, which is an array of region codes.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the width of the default thumbnail (`return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width`) is not equal to the size of the array of blocked regions (`size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`). 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**:
   - `return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width`: This is an integer representing the width of the default thumbnail image. It can take various integer values depending on the thumbnail's dimensions.
   - `size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`: This represents the number of countries where the video is blocked. It can be zero (if the video is viewable in all countries), or it can be any positive integer depending on the restrictions applied to the video.

2. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If the `width` of the thumbnail is, for example, 120 and the `blocked` array is empty (size 0), the invariant holds true (120 != 0).
   - If the `width` is 120 and the `blocked` array has 1 entry (size 1), the invariant holds true (120 != 1).
   - However, if the `width` is 0 (hypothetically, if such a case exists) and the `blocked` array is also empty (size 0), the invariant would fail (0 == 0).
   - Additionally, if the `width` is 1 and the `blocked` array has 1 entry (size 1), the invariant would also fail (1 == 1).

3. **Conclusion**:
The invariant does not hold true in all cases. There are scenarios where the width of the thumbnail can equal the size of the blocked regions array, particularly when both are zero or both are equal positive integers. Therefore, the invariant is not universally valid for all valid requests to the API.

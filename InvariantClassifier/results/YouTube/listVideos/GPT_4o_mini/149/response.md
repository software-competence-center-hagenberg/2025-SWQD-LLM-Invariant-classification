### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource has a `snippet` object containing a `thumbnails` object, which in turn has a `default` object with a `width` property. Additionally, there is a `contentDetails` object that includes a `regionRestriction` object, which has a `blocked` property that is an array of region codes.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`. This means that the width of the default thumbnail must be greater than the number of regions in which the video is blocked.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**: The `width` of the thumbnail is an integer that represents the width of the thumbnail image. The `blocked` property is an array of strings representing region codes where the video is blocked. The size of this array can be zero (if the video is viewable in all countries) or greater than zero (if there are specific countries where the video is blocked).

2. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If `width` is a small integer (e.g., 100) and `blocked` is an empty array (size 0), the invariant holds true (100 > 0).
   - If `width` is 0 (hypothetically, if such a case exists) and `blocked` has one or more entries, the invariant fails (0 > size of blocked array).
   - If `width` is equal to the size of the `blocked` array, the invariant fails (e.g., if width is 2 and blocked has 2 entries, 2 > 2 is false).

3. **Conclusion**: The invariant does not hold in all cases. Specifically, if the thumbnail width is less than or equal to the number of blocked regions, the invariant will not be satisfied. Therefore, it is not universally true for all valid responses from the API.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it does not hold for every valid request on the API. There are scenarios where the width of the thumbnail can be less than or equal to the size of the blocked regions, violating the invariant.

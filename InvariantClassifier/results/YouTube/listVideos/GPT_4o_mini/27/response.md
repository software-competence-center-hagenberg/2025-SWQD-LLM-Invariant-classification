### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an `items` array, where each item can have a `processingDetails` object. Within `processingDetails`, there is a `processingProgress` object that describes the processing status and progress of the video.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.processingDetails.processingProgress == null`. This implies that for every valid response from this endpoint, the `processingProgress` field should always be null.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Processing Progress Field**: The `processingProgress` field is described as containing information about the video processing status and progress. This suggests that it may not always be null, especially if the video is still being processed or if there is relevant progress information available.
2. **Possible Values**: Since the `processingProgress` field is part of the `processingDetails`, which is related to the state of video processing, it is reasonable to expect that there could be scenarios where `processingProgress` is populated with data (e.g., when a video is being processed). Therefore, it is not guaranteed that this field will always be null.
3. **Response Variability**: The invariant suggests a strict condition that does not account for the variability of the processing state of videos. Since videos can be in different states of processing, the `processingProgress` field may contain valid data in some responses.

### Conclusion
Given the nature of the `processingProgress` field, which is likely to contain information about the processing status of videos, the invariant `return.processingDetails.processingProgress == null` does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

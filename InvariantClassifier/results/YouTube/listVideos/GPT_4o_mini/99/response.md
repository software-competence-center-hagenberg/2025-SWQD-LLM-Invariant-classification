### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource can contain various details, including `contentDetails` and `liveStreamingDetails`. 

- **contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed**: This is an array of strings representing country codes where the video is viewable. If this property is present and contains an empty list, the video is blocked in all countries.
- **liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime**: This is a string that indicates when a live broadcast ended, and it will only be available after the broadcast has concluded.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]`. This implies that the actual end time of a live stream is somehow constrained by the countries where the video is allowed to be viewed.

### Analysis
1. **Nature of the Fields**: The `actualEndTime` is a timestamp indicating when a live stream ended, while `allowed[]` is a list of country codes. These two fields represent fundamentally different types of data: one is a time value, and the other is a list of strings representing countries.
2. **Logical Relationship**: There is no inherent logical relationship that would guarantee that a timestamp (the end time of a live stream) would be a member of an array of country codes. The `actualEndTime` does not represent a country code and cannot be compared to the values in `allowed[]`.
3. **Possible Scenarios**: It is entirely possible for a video to have an `actualEndTime` without being restricted by any country codes, or vice versa. The presence of `actualEndTime` does not imply anything about the `allowed[]` array.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant that `return.liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]` is incorrect. The two fields are unrelated in terms of their data types and meanings, leading to the conclusion that this invariant is a false-positive.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The request can include a query parameter `maxWidth`, which is an optional integer that specifies the maximum height of the player. The response includes a `pageInfo` object that contains `resultsPerPage`, which indicates how many results are returned in the API response.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxWidth > return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage`, meaning that the value of `maxWidth` provided in the request must be greater than the number of results returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding `maxWidth`**: The `maxWidth` parameter is related to the display size of the video player and does not inherently limit or dictate the number of results returned by the API. It is simply a parameter for display purposes.
2. **Understanding `resultsPerPage`**: The `resultsPerPage` indicates how many video resources are returned in the response. This value can vary based on the API's internal logic, the number of available resources, and any filtering applied.
3. **Relationship between `maxWidth` and `resultsPerPage`**: There is no logical connection between the `maxWidth` parameter and the `resultsPerPage` value. The API could return any number of results regardless of the `maxWidth` specified. For example, if `maxWidth` is set to 1000 and the API returns 5 results, the invariant would hold true. However, if `maxWidth` is set to 50 and the API still returns 5 results, the invariant would not hold. 

### Conclusion
Since there is no inherent relationship between the `maxWidth` parameter and the `resultsPerPage` value, the invariant `input.maxWidth > return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage` cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

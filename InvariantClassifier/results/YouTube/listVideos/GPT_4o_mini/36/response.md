### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of videos from the YouTube API. The response schema indicates that the response will include an array of items, each containing a snippet with various properties, including thumbnails. The thumbnails object has a property 'high' which is itself an object containing a 'height' property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.snippet.thumbnails.high.height == 360`. This implies that for every valid response from the API, the height of the high-resolution thumbnail must always equal 360 pixels.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the API Response**: The API is designed to retrieve a list of videos, and the thumbnails are part of the video details. The height of the thumbnail can vary based on the video and the resolution available. 
2. **Variability of Thumbnail Heights**: YouTube typically provides multiple resolutions for thumbnails (e.g., low, medium, high). The height of the high-resolution thumbnail is not guaranteed to be 360 pixels for every video. In fact, it can vary depending on the video itself and the aspect ratio of the thumbnail.
3. **Conclusion from Analysis**: Since the height of the thumbnail can differ from video to video, the invariant that states `return.snippet.thumbnails.high.height == 360` cannot be universally true for all valid responses from the API. 

### Conclusion
Given that the height of the high-resolution thumbnail is not fixed and can vary, the invariant is incorrect. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

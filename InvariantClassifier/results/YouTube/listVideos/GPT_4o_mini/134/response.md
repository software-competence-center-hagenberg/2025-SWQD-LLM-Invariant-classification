### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. The response includes an `items` array, where each item contains `contentDetails` and `status` objects. The `contentDetails` object has a `regionRestriction` property that includes a `blocked` array, which lists the countries where the video is blocked. The `status` object contains a `license` property that indicates the video's license type.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.status.license` must always be a member of the `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`. This means that the license type of the video must always be present in the list of blocked regions for the video.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**: The `license` property in the `status` object indicates the type of license the video has (e.g., `youtube`, `creativeCommon`). The `blocked` array in `regionRestriction` indicates which countries cannot view the video.
2. **Logical Connection**: The invariant suggests a direct relationship between the video's license and the countries where it is blocked. However, the license type does not inherently determine the regions where a video is blocked. A video can have a license of `youtube` or `creativeCommon`, but the blocked regions are determined by other factors, such as copyright restrictions or content agreements, not the license type itself.
3. **Possible Scenarios**: There can be scenarios where a video with a specific license is viewable in all countries (i.e., `blocked` is an empty array) or blocked in certain countries regardless of its license type. Therefore, the invariant does not hold true universally.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because there is no inherent rule that the `status.license` must be a member of the `contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`. The relationship between the license type and the blocked regions is not guaranteed, making the invariant incorrect for every valid request on the API.

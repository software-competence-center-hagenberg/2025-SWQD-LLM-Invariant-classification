### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving videos from the YouTube API. The endpoint allows for an optional query parameter `id`, which is an array of video IDs. The response includes a `pageInfo` object that contains a property `resultsPerPage`, which indicates the number of results included in the API response.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage == size(input.id[])`, meaning that the number of results returned in the response (`resultsPerPage`) should equal the number of IDs provided in the request (`input.id[]`). 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding `resultsPerPage`:** The `resultsPerPage` field indicates how many results are returned in a single API response. This value can be influenced by various factors, including pagination settings and the total number of available resources.
2. **Understanding `input.id[]`:** The `input.id[]` parameter is optional and can be empty. If no IDs are provided, `size(input.id[])` would be 0.
3. **Possible Scenarios:** 
   - If `input.id[]` is provided with multiple IDs, the API may return fewer results than the number of IDs specified due to various reasons (e.g., some IDs may not exist, or the API may limit the number of results returned).
   - If `input.id[]` is empty, the invariant would imply that `resultsPerPage` should be 0, which is not a valid scenario as the API would still return a default number of results (e.g., 10).

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage == size(input.id[])` does not hold true for every valid request to the API. The number of results returned can vary independently of the number of IDs provided, making this invariant a false-positive.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response contains an array of items, each of which may include properties such as `liveStreamingDetails` and `topicDetails`. 

- **liveStreamingDetails**: Contains a property `scheduledEndTime`, which is a string that indicates when a live broadcast is scheduled to end. If this property is absent or empty, it implies that the broadcast is ongoing indefinitely.
- **topicDetails**: Contains a property `topicCategories`, which is an array of strings representing Wikipedia URLs related to the video's content.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime` is always a member of `return.topicDetails.topicCategories[]`. This means that the scheduled end time of a live stream should always be found within the list of topic categories associated with the video.

### Analysis
1. **Independence of Properties**: The `liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime` and `topicDetails.topicCategories` are independent properties. The scheduled end time is related to the live streaming aspect of the video, while topic categories are related to the content description of the video. There is no inherent relationship that guarantees that the scheduled end time will be included in the topic categories.
2. **Possible Values**: The `scheduledEndTime` could be a specific timestamp (e.g., "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z") or it could be empty or absent if the broadcast is ongoing. The `topicCategories` are strings that represent URLs, which are unlikely to include a timestamp.
3. **Lack of Constraints**: The Swagger definition does not impose any constraints or relationships between these two properties. Therefore, it is entirely possible for `scheduledEndTime` to have a value that is not present in `topicCategories`.

### Conclusion
Given the independence of the properties and the lack of any defined relationship between `scheduledEndTime` and `topicCategories`, the invariant that `return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime` is always a member of `return.topicDetails.topicCategories[]` is incorrect. Thus, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response includes a property `items`, which is an array of video resources, each containing a `snippet` object. Within the `snippet`, there is a `thumbnails` object, which contains a `high` object that has a `width` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `width` of the thumbnail image for a video resource is divisible by the size of the `input.part` array, expressed as `return.snippet.thumbnails.high.width % size(input.part[]) == 0`. This means that the width should be a multiple of the number of elements in the `part` query parameter.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the `part` Parameter**: The `part` parameter is required and specifies which properties of the video resource to include in the response. It is an array, and its size can vary depending on the request made by the client.
2. **Understanding the `width` Property**: The `width` property of the `high` thumbnail is an integer that represents the width of the thumbnail image. There is no inherent relationship defined in the API documentation between the `width` of the thumbnail and the size of the `part` array.
3. **Divisibility Condition**: The invariant suggests that the `width` of the thumbnail must be divisible by the size of the `part` array. However, there is no logical or documented reason to assume that the `width` of a thumbnail would be influenced by the number of properties requested in the `part` parameter. The width is likely a fixed value determined by the thumbnail's design and not dependent on the API request parameters.

### Conclusion
Since there is no basis in the API documentation to support the claim that the `width` of the thumbnail should be divisible by the size of the `part` array, the invariant is incorrect. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that each video resource contains a `snippet` object with a `thumbnails` object, which includes a `maxres` object that has a `width` property. Additionally, the response includes `contentDetails` with a `regionRestriction` object that contains a `blocked` array, which lists countries where the video is blocked.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.width > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`. This means that the width of the maximum resolution thumbnail must be greater than the number of countries in the `blocked` list.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**:
   - `return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.width`: This is an integer representing the width of the maximum resolution thumbnail image.
   - `size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`: This is the size of the `blocked` array, which can be zero or more, depending on the video.

2. **Possible Values**:
   - The `maxres.width` can vary based on the video and is not guaranteed to be large. It could be a small number or even zero if no thumbnail is available.
   - The `blocked` array can also be empty, meaning the video is viewable in all countries, or it can contain several entries.

3. **Counterexamples**:
   - If `maxres.width` is 0 (or a small number), and the `blocked` array is empty, the invariant would not hold since 0 is not greater than 0.
   - If `maxres.width` is 1 and the `blocked` array has 1 entry, the invariant would also not hold since 1 is not greater than 1.

### Conclusion
The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API because there are scenarios where the width of the thumbnail is less than or equal to the size of the blocked countries array. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

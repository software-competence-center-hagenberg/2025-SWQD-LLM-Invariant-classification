### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos, including their content details and snippets. The response schema indicates that each video item has a `snippet` containing `thumbnails`, and `contentDetails` that may include `regionRestriction` with an `allowed` property that is an array of strings representing country codes.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the URL of the high-resolution thumbnail (`return.snippet.thumbnails.high.url`) is always a member of the array of allowed region codes (`return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]`).

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**: The `return.snippet.thumbnails.high.url` is a string representing the URL of a thumbnail image. The `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.allowed[]` is an array of strings representing country codes where the video is viewable.
2. **Logical Relationship**: There is no inherent relationship between a thumbnail URL and the allowed region codes. The thumbnail URL is not expected to be a country code; it is an image URL. Therefore, it is logically impossible for a URL to be a member of an array that contains country codes.
3. **Possible Scenarios**: Even if a video is viewable in certain regions (as indicated by the `allowed` array), this does not imply that the thumbnail URL would correspond to any of those codes. The invariant suggests a relationship that does not exist based on the definitions provided.

### Conclusion
The invariant is incorrect because it asserts a relationship between two unrelated properties. The URL of a thumbnail cannot be a member of an array of country codes. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/youtube/v3/videos"
  get:
    description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Retrieves a list of resources, possibly filtered.
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              items:
                id:
                  type: string
                  description: The ID that YouTube uses to uniquely identify the video.
              items:
                snippet:
                  type: object
                  description: Basic details about a video, including title, description, uploader, thumbnails and category.
                  properties:
                    thumbnails:
                      type: object
                      description: Internal representation of thumbnails for a YouTube resource.
                      properties:
                        default:
                          type: object
                          description: A thumbnail is an image representing a YouTube resource.
                          properties:
                            url:
                              type: string
                              description: The thumbnail image's URL.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.id is a substring of return.snippet.thumbnails.default.url

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString
Invariant description: Represents the substring invariant between two String scalars. Prints as x is a substring of y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which returns a response with a property `kind`. The `kind` property is defined as a string that identifies the resource type, specifically stating that its value is the fixed string "youtube#videoListResponse".

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `kind` field in the response is always 13 characters: `LENGTH(return.kind)==13`. This is a specific assertion about the length of the string returned in the `kind` field.

### Analysis
Given the description in the Swagger definition, the `kind` field is explicitly defined to have the fixed value "youtube#videoListResponse". The length of this string is indeed 13 characters. Therefore, for every valid response from this endpoint, the `kind` field will always be this fixed string, leading to the conclusion that the length of `kind` will always be 13.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant accurately reflects the fixed nature of the `kind` field as described in the Swagger definition, it holds true for every valid request to this API endpoint. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an array of items, each with a `snippet` object that includes a `thumbnails` object. Within `thumbnails`, there is a `default` object that contains a `width` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width == 120`. This suggests that every time a response is received from this endpoint, the width of the default thumbnail will always be 120.

### Analysis
1. **Response Variability**: The invariant assumes that the `width` of the default thumbnail is fixed at 120 for all video resources. However, the Swagger definition does not specify any constraints or fixed values for the `width` property. It only describes the structure of the response.
2. **YouTube API Behavior**: In practice, the width of thumbnails can vary based on the video, the uploader's settings, or other factors. YouTube may return different thumbnail sizes for different videos, and there is no indication in the Swagger definition that the width will always be 120.
3. **Lack of Constraints**: Since the Swagger definition does not impose any constraints on the `width` property, it is incorrect to assume that it will always equal 120. The invariant does not account for the possibility of other values being returned.

### Conclusion
Given the variability of thumbnail widths in the YouTube API and the lack of constraints in the Swagger definition, the invariant `return.snippet.thumbnails.default.width == 120` does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

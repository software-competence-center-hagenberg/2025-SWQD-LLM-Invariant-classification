### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which returns a list of video resources. Within the response schema, there is a property `liveStreamingDetails` that contains a property `concurrentViewers`. This property is defined as a string that represents the number of concurrent viewers watching a live broadcast. The description specifies that this property will only be present if there are current viewers and the broadcast owner has not hidden the view count.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.concurrentViewers` is Numeric, which is represented as `x is Numeric`. This implies that the value of `concurrentViewers` should always be a numeric string.

### Analysis
The key point in the description of `concurrentViewers` is that it is a string. While it is intended to represent a numeric value (the count of viewers), it is explicitly defined as a string type in the schema. This means that while the string may contain numeric characters, it is not guaranteed to be purely numeric in all cases. For example, if the broadcast owner hides the view count, the `concurrentViewers` property may not be present at all, or it could potentially contain non-numeric characters (like an empty string or a string with non-numeric characters) if the API implementation allows such cases. Therefore, the invariant that `return.liveStreamingDetails.concurrentViewers` is always numeric does not hold true for every valid request on the API.

### Conclusion
Given that `concurrentViewers` is defined as a string and may not always contain numeric characters, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. It does not hold for every valid request on the API because the property may not always be present or may contain non-numeric values.

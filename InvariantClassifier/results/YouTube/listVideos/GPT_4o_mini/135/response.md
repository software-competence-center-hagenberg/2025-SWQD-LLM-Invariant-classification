### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response includes an array of items, each containing content details and status. The content details include a deprecated property `regionRestriction`, which has a `blocked` array that lists countries where the video is blocked. The `status` object includes a `privacyStatus` property that indicates the video's privacy status.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.status.privacyStatus` is always a member of `return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[]`. This means that the privacy status of the video is expected to be one of the countries where the video is blocked.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**: The `privacyStatus` property indicates whether a video is public, unlisted, or private. This property does not have any direct correlation with the `blocked` array, which lists country codes where the video is restricted. 
2. **Logical Connection**: The invariant suggests that the privacy status of a video (which is related to visibility on the platform) is somehow tied to the geographical restrictions (blocked countries). This is logically incorrect because a video can be public (accessible to everyone) but still be blocked in certain countries due to regional restrictions. 
3. **Possible Values**: The `privacyStatus` can be `public`, `unlisted`, or `private`, while the `blocked` array contains country codes. There is no scenario where a privacy status would be a member of a list of country codes.

### Conclusion
The invariant is incorrect because it assumes a relationship between the privacy status of a video and the geographical restrictions that do not exist. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

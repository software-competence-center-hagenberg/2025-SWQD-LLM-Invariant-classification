### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will include a `pageInfo` object containing a property `resultsPerPage` that is defined as an integer.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 1`. This means that the API response should always return a value for `resultsPerPage` that is greater than or equal to 1.

### Analysis
The `resultsPerPage` property is meant to indicate how many results are included in the API response. In a typical pagination scenario, it is common for APIs to return at least one result per page, especially if the request is valid and there are resources available. However, there are scenarios where the API might return an empty list of resources, which could lead to `resultsPerPage` being set to 0 or not being included at all. 

For example, if there are no videos available that match the filter criteria, the API might return an empty list, and in such cases, `resultsPerPage` could logically be 0. Therefore, the invariant `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 1` does not hold true for every valid request, particularly when there are no resources to return.

### Conclusion
Given the possibility of the API returning an empty list of resources, the invariant `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= 1` is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request. Thus, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

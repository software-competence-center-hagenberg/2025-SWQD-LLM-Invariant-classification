### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which returns a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the `liveStreamingDetails` object may contain a property called `scheduledEndTime`, which is a string. The description states that if the value is empty or the property is not present, the broadcast is scheduled to continue indefinitely.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `scheduledEndTime` string is always equal to 20 characters: `LENGTH(return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime)==20`. This implies that every valid response will have a `scheduledEndTime` string that is exactly 20 characters long.

### Analysis
1. **Presence of Property**: The description of `scheduledEndTime` indicates that it may not always be present in the response. If it is absent, the invariant cannot hold since there would be no string to measure the length of.
2. **Empty Value**: The description also states that if the value is empty, the broadcast continues indefinitely. An empty string has a length of 0, which contradicts the invariant that it must be 20 characters long.
3. **Fixed Length Assumption**: The invariant assumes that whenever `scheduledEndTime` is present, it will always have a length of 20 characters. However, the API documentation does not guarantee this, as it only specifies that the property may be empty or absent, without specifying the exact format or length of the string when it is present.

### Conclusion
Given that the `scheduledEndTime` can be absent or empty, the invariant `LENGTH(return.liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime)==20` cannot hold for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

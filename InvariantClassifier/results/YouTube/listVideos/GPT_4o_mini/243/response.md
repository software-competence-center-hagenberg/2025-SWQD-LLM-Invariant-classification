### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which returns a response containing a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the `items` property is an array of objects, and each object contains a `player` property. The `player` property is an object that has an `embedWidth` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.player.embedWidth` is Numeric, which means that the value of `embedWidth` should always consist of numeric characters.

### Analysis
1. **Type of `embedWidth`:** According to the Swagger definition, `embedWidth` is defined as a string. This means that it can contain any characters that are valid in a string, including numeric characters, alphabetic characters, and special characters.
2. **Numeric Validation:** The invariant claims that `embedWidth` is always numeric. However, since `embedWidth` is a string, it can potentially hold non-numeric values (e.g., "100px", "auto", etc.). Therefore, it is not guaranteed that `embedWidth` will always be numeric.
3. **Response Variability:** The API may return different values for `embedWidth` based on various factors (e.g., video type, settings), and there is no restriction in the Swagger definition that enforces `embedWidth` to be numeric.

### Conclusion
Given that `embedWidth` is defined as a string and can contain non-numeric values, the invariant that `return.player.embedWidth is Numeric` does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a false-positive.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The response schema indicates that the response will be an object containing an `items` array. Each item in this array has a `fileDetails` property, which is an object that describes various properties of the video file.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.fileDetails == null`, which implies that for every item in the `items` array, the `fileDetails` property is expected to be null.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: According to the Swagger definition, the `fileDetails` property is part of the items in the response. It is described as an object that contains technical details about the video. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that `fileDetails` would contain data for most valid video resources.
2. **Possibility of Null Values**: While it is possible for some video resources to not have file details (e.g., if the video is not fully processed or if there is an error in retrieving the details), the invariant suggests that this should always be the case, which is not supported by the definition. The invariant does not account for scenarios where `fileDetails` may be present and valid.
3. **General Validity**: The invariant implies a strict condition that does not align with the flexibility typically found in REST API responses. The presence of `fileDetails` being null for all items is not a guaranteed behavior based on the provided schema.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant `return.fileDetails == null` does not hold for every valid request on the API, as there are valid scenarios where `fileDetails` would contain data, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The expectation that `fileDetails` will always be null contradicts the description of the API's response structure.

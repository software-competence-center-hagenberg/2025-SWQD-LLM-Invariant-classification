### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of videos from YouTube. The relevant parameter is `maxWidth`, which is an optional integer parameter that specifies the maximum height for the player. The response schema indicates that the response will include an array of items, each containing `contentDetails`, which in turn has a `regionRestriction` property. This property includes a `blocked` array that lists the countries where the video is blocked.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxWidth > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])`. This means that the value of `maxWidth` must be greater than the number of countries listed in the `blocked` array of the `regionRestriction` property.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding `maxWidth`**: The `maxWidth` parameter is used to specify the maximum height of the player and is not directly related to the content or availability of the video. It is a UI-related parameter.
2. **Understanding `blocked`**: The `blocked` array indicates the countries where the video is not available. The size of this array can vary based on the video and does not have a direct correlation to the `maxWidth` parameter.
3. **Logical Relationship**: There is no inherent logical relationship that guarantees `maxWidth` will always be greater than the size of the `blocked` array. For example, if `maxWidth` is set to 100 and the `blocked` array is empty (size 0), the invariant holds true. However, if `maxWidth` is set to 1 and there are 2 countries in the `blocked` array, the invariant would not hold.

### Conclusion
The invariant `input.maxWidth > size(return.contentDetails.regionRestriction.blocked[])` does not hold for every valid request on the API. The relationship between `maxWidth` and the size of the `blocked` array is not guaranteed, making this invariant a false-positive.

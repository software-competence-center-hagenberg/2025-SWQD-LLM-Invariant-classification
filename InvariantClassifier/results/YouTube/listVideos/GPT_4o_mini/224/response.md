### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving a list of YouTube videos. The response includes a `pageInfo` object that contains a `resultsPerPage` property, which indicates the number of results included in the API response. Additionally, the response includes an `items` array that contains the actual video resources returned by the API.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the number of results per page (`return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage`) should be greater than or equal to the number of items returned (`size(return.items[])`). This can be expressed as:

`return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= size(return.items[])`

### Analysis
1. **Understanding `resultsPerPage`:** The `resultsPerPage` indicates how many items the API is expected to return in a single response. This value can be set by the client when making the request, and it can vary based on the request parameters.
2. **Understanding `items`:** The `items` array contains the actual video resources returned by the API. The size of this array can be less than or equal to `resultsPerPage` depending on the number of available resources that match the request criteria.
3. **Possible Scenarios:** 
   - If there are fewer items available than `resultsPerPage`, the API will return only the available items, making the invariant true (e.g., if `resultsPerPage` is 10 and only 5 items are available, then `5 <= 10`).
   - If there are exactly as many items as `resultsPerPage`, the invariant holds true (e.g., if `resultsPerPage` is 10 and 10 items are returned).
   - However, if the API is configured to return more items than `resultsPerPage` (which should not happen according to the definition), it would violate the invariant. But based on the API's design, it should not return more items than specified by `resultsPerPage`.

### Conclusion
Given that the API is designed to return a number of items that does not exceed `resultsPerPage`, the invariant `return.pageInfo.resultsPerPage >= size(return.items[])` holds true for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

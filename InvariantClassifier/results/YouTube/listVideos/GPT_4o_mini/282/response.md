### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which returns a list of video resources. Each video resource can have associated properties, including `liveStreamingDetails` and `snippet`. The `liveStreamingDetails` contains an `activeLiveChatId`, which is only present if the video is currently live. The `snippet` contains a `tags` array, which holds keyword tags associated with the video.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.liveStreamingDetails.activeLiveChatId` is always a member of `return.snippet.tags[]`. This implies that whenever `activeLiveChatId` is present, it must also be found within the `tags` array of the same video resource.

### Analysis
1. **Conditional Presence**: The `activeLiveChatId` is only present when the video is a currently live broadcast. If the video is not live, `activeLiveChatId` will not be present at all.
2. **Tags Independence**: The `tags` array is independent of the `liveStreamingDetails`. There is no indication in the Swagger definition that `activeLiveChatId` is related to or should be included in the `tags` array. Tags are meant for keywords associated with the video, and there is no requirement or logical connection that the `activeLiveChatId` must be one of those tags.
3. **False Positive Scenario**: If a video is live, it may have an `activeLiveChatId`, but there is no guarantee that this ID will be included in the `tags`. Conversely, if a video is not live, `activeLiveChatId` will not exist, making the invariant trivially true in that case, but not necessarily true when it does exist.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because there is no requirement or logical basis for `activeLiveChatId` to be included in the `tags` array. The presence of `activeLiveChatId` does not imply its membership in `tags`, making the invariant incorrect for every valid request on the API.

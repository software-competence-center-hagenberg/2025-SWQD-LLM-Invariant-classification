### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/youtube/v3/videos`, which retrieves a list of video resources. The request can include an optional query parameter `maxHeight`, which is an integer that specifies the maximum height of the videos to be retrieved. The response includes a `pageInfo` object that contains `totalResults`, which indicates the total number of video resources available.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.maxHeight != return.pageInfo.totalResults`. This means that the value of `maxHeight` provided in the request should not equal the total number of results returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding `maxHeight`**: The `maxHeight` parameter is used to filter the videos based on their height. It does not directly correlate to the total number of results returned. The total number of results (`totalResults`) reflects how many videos match the filtering criteria, which could be any number depending on the available videos and the specified `maxHeight`.

2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If there are 100 videos available and the `maxHeight` is set to 1080, the API might return 50 videos that match this height, resulting in `totalResults` being 50. Here, `maxHeight` (1080) is not equal to `totalResults` (50).
   - However, if there are exactly 72 videos that match the `maxHeight` of 72, then `totalResults` would be 72, leading to a situation where `maxHeight` (72) equals `totalResults` (72).

3. **Conclusion**: The invariant `input.maxHeight != return.pageInfo.totalResults` does not hold in all cases. Specifically, it can be false when the number of results returned matches the `maxHeight` value, which is a valid scenario based on the API's functionality.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because there are valid requests where `maxHeight` can equal `totalResults`, violating the invariant.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the `/youtube/v3/videos` endpoint, which retrieves a list of video resources. The `part` query parameter is required and specifies which properties of the video resource to include in the response. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an `items` array, where each item has a `snippet` object that includes a `thumbnails` object. The `thumbnails` object contains a `maxres` object, which in turn has a `width` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.width > size(input.part[])`. This means that the width of the maximum resolution thumbnail in the response should be greater than the size of the `part` array provided in the request.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding `input.part[]`:** The `input.part[]` refers to the number of properties requested in the `part` parameter. For example, if the request specifies `part=snippet`, the size would be 1. If it specifies `part=snippet,contentDetails`, the size would be 2.
2. **Understanding `return.snippet.thumbnails.maxres.width`:** This is the width of the maximum resolution thumbnail returned in the response. The actual value of this width can vary based on the video being retrieved. 
3. **Evaluating the invariant:** The invariant asserts that the width of the thumbnail must always be greater than the number of properties requested. However, there is no inherent relationship between the width of the thumbnail and the number of properties requested. For example, if the width of the thumbnail is 120 pixels and the request asks for 2 properties, the invariant would be false (120 > 2 is true, but if the width were 1, it would be false). 

### Conclusion
Since there is no guarantee that the width of the thumbnail will always be greater than the size of the `part` array, this invariant does not hold for every valid request to the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

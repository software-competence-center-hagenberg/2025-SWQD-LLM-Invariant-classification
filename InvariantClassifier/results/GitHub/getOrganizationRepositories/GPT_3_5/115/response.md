### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition contains a GET endpoint for listing organization repositories. The response schema includes properties for 'url' and 'owner', with 'owner' being an object containing 'following_url'.

### Invariant

The invariant 'return.owner.url is a substring of return.owner.following_url' specifies that the 'url' property of the 'owner' object in the response should be a substring of the 'following_url' property.

### Analysis

Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'owner' object does not have a 'url' property. Therefore, the invariant 'return.owner.url is a substring of return.owner.following_url' is not applicable to the response schema described in the Swagger definition.

### Conclusion

The invariant is false-positive as it does not align with the structure of the response schema in the Swagger definition.

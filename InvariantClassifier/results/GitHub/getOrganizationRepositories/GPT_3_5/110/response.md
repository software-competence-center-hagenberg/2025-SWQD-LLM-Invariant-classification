### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/orgs/{org}/repos' is a GET request that lists repositories for the specified organization.
- The response schema includes 'full_name' and 'html_url' properties.

### Invariant
- The invariant states that 'return.full_name' is a substring of 'return.html_url'.

### Analysis
- The provided Swagger definition does not explicitly guarantee that 'return.full_name' will always be a substring of 'return.html_url'.
- The response schema does not enforce any relationship between 'full_name' and 'html_url'.

### Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive because the Swagger definition does not ensure that 'return.full_name' is always a substring of 'return.html_url'.

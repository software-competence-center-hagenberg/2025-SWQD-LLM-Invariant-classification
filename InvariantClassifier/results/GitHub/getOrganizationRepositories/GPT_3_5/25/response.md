The invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the 'input.per_page' parameter is optional and not required, which means that it may not always be present in the request. As a result, the comparison 'input.per_page > size(return.topics[])' may not hold for requests where 'per_page' is not provided. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a GET endpoint for listing organization repositories.
- The response schema includes a property 'html_url' with type 'string'.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that 'return.owner.html_url' is a substring of 'return.html_url'.

## Analysis
- The provided swagger definition does not include a property 'owner' in the response schema, so 'return.owner.html_url' is not a valid field.
- Therefore, the invariant cannot be evaluated as it references a non-existent field.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it references a non-existent field in the response schema.

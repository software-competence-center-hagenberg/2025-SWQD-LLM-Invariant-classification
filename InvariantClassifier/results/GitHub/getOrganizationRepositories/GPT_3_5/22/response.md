The invariant input.per_page < return.id is a false-positive for the given REST endpoint. The reason for this is that the 'per_page' parameter is optional and can be omitted from the request. In such cases, the response will not be dependent on the 'per_page' parameter, and the invariant will not hold for all valid requests. Therefore, this invariant is not true for every valid request on the API.

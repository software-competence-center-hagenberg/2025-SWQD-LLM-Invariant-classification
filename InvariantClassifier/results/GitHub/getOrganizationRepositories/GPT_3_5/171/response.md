The invariant is false-positive. The Swagger definition does not enforce that the 'mirror_url' field can only have the specified values. The 'mirror_url' field is defined as a string type in the response schema, but there are no constraints or enum values specified to limit its possible values to the given set. Therefore, the API does not guarantee that 'mirror_url' will be one of the specified values for every valid request.

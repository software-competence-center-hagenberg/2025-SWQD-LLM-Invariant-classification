## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a GET request to "/orgs/{org}/repos" which lists repositories for the specified organization.
- The response schema includes a property 'releases_url' of type string with an example URL.

## Invariant
- The invariant specifies that the 'releases_url' in the response is always a URL.

## Analysis
- The swagger definition does not provide any constraints or validation on the format of the 'releases_url' property.
- The example provided in the schema is a URL, but it does not guarantee that all 'releases_url' values will be URLs.

## Conclusion
- The invariant is a false-positive because the swagger definition does not enforce that the 'releases_url' is always a URL. It is possible for the 'releases_url' to be a non-URL string, making the invariant incorrect.

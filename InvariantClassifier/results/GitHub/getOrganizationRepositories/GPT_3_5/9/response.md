The invariant return.permissions.admin == return.permissions.triage is a false-positive. This is because the Swagger definition provided does not specify the structure of the 'return' object in the response body. Without knowing the structure of the response body, it is not possible to determine if the 'permissions' object and its 'admin' and 'triage' properties even exist. Therefore, the invariant cannot be classified as true-positive based on the given Swagger definition.

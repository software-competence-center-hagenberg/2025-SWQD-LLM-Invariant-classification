The invariant return.id != return.size is a false-positive for the given REST endpoint. The reason for this is that the provided Swagger definition does not specify the structure of the response body in detail. It only includes an example of the response body, which may not accurately represent all possible responses. Without a comprehensive schema definition, it cannot be guaranteed that return.id and return.size will always be present and of the expected types in the actual responses. Therefore, the invariant cannot be reliably applied to all valid requests on the API.

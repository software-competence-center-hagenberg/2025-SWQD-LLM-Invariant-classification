The invariant 'return.url is a substring of return.issue_events_url' is a false-positive. This is because the Swagger definition does not guarantee that the 'url' field will be a substring of the 'issue_events_url' field in the response. The example provided in the Swagger definition does not demonstrate a relationship where 'url' is a substring of 'issue_events_url'. Therefore, this invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

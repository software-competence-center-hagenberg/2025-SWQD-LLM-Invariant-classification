The invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant assumes a relationship between the input parameter 'per_page' and the size of the 'array' in the response. However, the 'per_page' parameter is a request parameter that specifies the number of results per page, and it does not directly correlate with the size of the 'array' in the response. The 'per_page' parameter only controls the pagination of the results and does not guarantee a direct relationship with the size of the 'array' in the response.

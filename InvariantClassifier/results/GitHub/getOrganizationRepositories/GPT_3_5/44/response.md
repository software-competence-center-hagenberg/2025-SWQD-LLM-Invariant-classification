The invariant input.page != size(return.array[])-1 is a false-positive for the given REST endpoint. The reason for this is that the 'page' parameter in the request is used for pagination, and it does not directly correlate with the size of the 'array' in the response. The 'page' parameter is used to specify the page number of the results to fetch, while the size of the 'array' in the response may not directly correspond to the page number. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

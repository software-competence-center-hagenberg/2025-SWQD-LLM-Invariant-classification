The invariant 'return.url is a substring of return.issue_comment_url' is a false-positive. This is because the Swagger definition provided does not guarantee that the 'url' field will always be a substring of the 'issue_comment_url' field in the response. The schema definition does not enforce any relationship between these two fields, and the example values provided do not demonstrate a substring relationship. Therefore, this invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

The given invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the Swagger definition provided does not include the fields 'return.owner.url' and 'return.owner.followers_url'. Therefore, the invariant cannot be evaluated against the provided Swagger definition. Without the presence of these fields in the response schema, the invariant cannot be classified as true-positive or false-positive.

The invariant 'return.array[] elements != null' is a false-positive for the given REST endpoint. The Swagger definition provided does not specify the structure or properties of the 'array' elements within the response. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that all 'array' elements will not be null. Without further information about the structure of the 'array' elements, this invariant cannot be classified as true-positive.

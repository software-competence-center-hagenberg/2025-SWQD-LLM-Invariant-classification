The invariant input.per_page < return.owner.id is false-positive. The reason for this is that the 'per_page' parameter is related to the number of results per page, and it is not directly related to the 'owner.id' field in the response. The 'owner.id' field represents the ID of the owner of the repository, which is not directly influenced by the 'per_page' parameter. Therefore, this invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

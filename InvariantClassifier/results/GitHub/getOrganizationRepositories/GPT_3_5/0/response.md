## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a GET request to the endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` which lists repositories for the specified organization.
- The response schema includes an array of repositories, each with an `owner` object containing a `login` property.

## Invariant
- The invariant `input.org == return.owner.login` checks if the input organization parameter is equal to the login of the owner of the returned repository.

## Analysis
- The invariant `input.org == return.owner.login` is true-positive.
- Given the swagger definition, the input parameter `org` is required and the response always includes the `owner` object with a `login` property for each repository. Therefore, the invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: true-positive
- The invariant `input.org == return.owner.login` is correct and holds for every valid request on the API.

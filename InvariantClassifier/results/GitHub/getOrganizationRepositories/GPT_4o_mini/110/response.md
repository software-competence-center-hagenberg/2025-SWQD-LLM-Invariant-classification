### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` that returns a list of repositories for a specified organization. The response is an array of objects, each containing two properties: `full_name` and `html_url`. 

- `full_name`: A string representing the full name of the repository (e.g., `octocat/Hello-World`).
- `html_url`: A string representing the URL of the repository on GitHub (e.g., `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World`).

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.full_name` is a substring of `return.html_url`. This means that the value of `full_name` should appear within the value of `html_url` for every valid response from this endpoint.

### Analysis
To evaluate the invariant, we need to analyze the relationship between `full_name` and `html_url`:
- The `full_name` of a repository is formatted as `owner/repo` (e.g., `octocat/Hello-World`).
- The `html_url` is formatted as `https://github.com/owner/repo` (e.g., `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World`).

In this case, the `full_name` does not appear as a substring in the `html_url` because the `html_url` includes a prefix (`https://github.com/`) that is not part of the `full_name`. Therefore, while both fields contain the same repository information, the `full_name` is not a substring of `html_url` due to the additional characters in the URL.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not hold true for every valid response from the API (as `full_name` is not a substring of `html_url`), the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

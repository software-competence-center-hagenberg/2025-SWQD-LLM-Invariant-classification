### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for listing repositories of a specified organization. The response is an array of repository objects, each containing an 'owner' object with various properties, including 'url' and 'following_url'. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.owner.url` is a substring of `return.owner.following_url`. This means that the URL of the repository owner should be contained within the following URL of the owner. 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Fields**: 
   - `return.owner.url`: This is the URL of the repository owner, which typically points to the owner's profile or a specific resource related to the owner.
   - `return.owner.following_url`: This URL is meant to indicate where to find the list of users that the owner is following. It is structured to include a placeholder for another user's username. 

2. **Relationship Between the URLs**: 
   - The `following_url` is not guaranteed to contain the `url` of the owner. The `following_url` is a template URL that may not even be directly related to the owner's URL. For example, if the owner's URL is `https://api.github.com/users/octocat`, the `following_url` might be `https://api.github.com/users/octocat/following{/other_user}`, which does not contain the owner's URL as a substring.
   - The invariant assumes a specific relationship between these two URLs that does not hold in general. There is no inherent requirement in the API specification that would ensure `return.owner.url` is a substring of `return.owner.following_url`.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant that `return.owner.url` is a substring of `return.owner.following_url` does not hold for every valid response from the API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

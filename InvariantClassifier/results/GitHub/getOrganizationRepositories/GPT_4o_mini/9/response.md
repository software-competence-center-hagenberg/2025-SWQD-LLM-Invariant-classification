### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint that lists repositories for a specified organization. The response schema indicates that the response will include a permissions object with two boolean properties: `admin` and `triage`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.permissions.admin == return.permissions.triage`, meaning that the value of the `admin` permission must always equal the value of the `triage` permission in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Boolean Values**: Both `admin` and `triage` are boolean values, which means they can either be `true` or `false`.
2. **Independent Permissions**: The permissions `admin` and `triage` are typically independent of each other. For example, a user might have admin rights (i.e., `admin` is `true`) but not have triage rights (i.e., `triage` is `false`), and vice versa.
3. **Real-World Scenarios**: In many systems, the permissions for different roles or actions are not directly correlated. Therefore, it is entirely plausible for `admin` and `triage` to have different values based on the user's role or the organization's policies.

### Conclusion
Given that the permissions `admin` and `triage` are independent and can have different boolean values, the invariant `return.permissions.admin == return.permissions.triage` does not hold for every valid request on the API. Thus, this invariant is a **false-positive**.

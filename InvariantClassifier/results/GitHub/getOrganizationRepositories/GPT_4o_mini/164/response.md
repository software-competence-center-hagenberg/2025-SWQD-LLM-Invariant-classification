### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for listing repositories of a specified organization. The response schema indicates that the response will be an array of objects, where each object has an 'owner' property that is an object itself. The 'owner' object contains a 'login' property (a string) and an 'html_url' property (also a string).

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.owner.login` is a substring of `return.owner.html_url`. This means that the value of the 'login' property should appear somewhere within the value of the 'html_url' property in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**: The 'login' property typically represents the username of the owner of the repository, while 'html_url' is the URL of the repository. For example, if the 'login' is 'octocat', the 'html_url' might look like 'https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World'. In this case, 'octocat' is indeed a substring of the URL.
2. **General Case**: However, the invariant does not hold universally. The 'html_url' is constructed based on the repository's owner and the repository name. If the repository name contains characters or patterns that do not include the owner's login, then the invariant would fail. For instance, if the 'login' is 'octocat' but the repository name is 'MyRepo', the 'html_url' would be 'https://github.com/octocat/MyRepo', and 'octocat' is still a substring. But if the login were 'octo' and the repository name were 'cat', the 'html_url' would be 'https://github.com/octo/cat', and 'octo' is not a substring of 'cat'. 
3. **Variability in Repository Names**: The repository names can vary widely, and there is no guarantee that the owner's login will always be a substring of the constructed URL. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant does not hold for all possible repository names and owner logins, it cannot be classified as a true-positive. Therefore, the invariant is a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for listing repositories of a specified organization. The response is an array of repository objects, each containing at least two properties: `url` and `comments_url`. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.url` is a substring of `return.comments_url`. This means that the URL of the repository should be found within the comments URL of the same repository.

### Analysis
1. **Structure of URLs**: The `url` field typically represents the main API endpoint for accessing a specific repository, while the `comments_url` is a specialized endpoint for accessing comments related to that repository. 
2. **Example URLs**: Given the examples provided in the Swagger definition:
   - `url`: `https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World`
   - `comments_url`: `http://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/comments{/number}`
3. **Substring Relationship**: In the examples, the `url` does not appear to be a substring of the `comments_url`. The `comments_url` includes additional path segments and a placeholder (`{/number}`) that makes it distinct from the `url`. 
4. **General Case**: Since the `comments_url` is constructed to include the repository's URL but with additional segments, it is not guaranteed that `url` will always be a substring of `comments_url`. For example, if the repository name or organization name changes, or if the URL structure changes, this relationship may not hold.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant that `return.url` is a substring of `return.comments_url` does not hold true for every valid request on the API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

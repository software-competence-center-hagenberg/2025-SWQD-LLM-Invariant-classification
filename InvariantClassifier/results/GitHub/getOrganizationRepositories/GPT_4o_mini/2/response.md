### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that lists repositories for a specified organization. The response is expected to be an array of repository objects, each containing at least two string properties: `html_url` and `svn_url`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `html_url` and `svn_url` fields in the response are equal: `return.html_url == return.svn_url`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Fields**: The `html_url` typically points to the web page of the repository on GitHub, while `svn_url` is the URL used for Subversion (SVN) checkout. These two URLs serve different purposes and are expected to be different.
2. **Real-World Example**: For instance, a repository's `html_url` might be `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World`, while its `svn_url` could be `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/svn`. These URLs are not equal, demonstrating that the invariant does not hold.
3. **General Case**: In general, for most repositories, the `html_url` and `svn_url` will not be the same, as they are designed to serve different functionalities.

### Conclusion
Given that the `html_url` and `svn_url` are fundamentally different URLs serving different purposes, the invariant `return.html_url == return.svn_url` is incorrect. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

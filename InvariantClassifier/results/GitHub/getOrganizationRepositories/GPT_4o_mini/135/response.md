### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint that lists repositories for a specified organization. The response is an array of objects, each containing at least two properties: `url` and `deployments_url`. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.url` is a substring of `return.deployments_url`. This means that the URL of the repository should be contained within the deployments URL for that repository.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the URLs**: The `url` typically points to the main repository endpoint, while `deployments_url` is specifically for accessing deployment-related information for that repository. 
2. **Structure of URLs**: In the example provided, the `url` is `https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World`, and the `deployments_url` is `http://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/deployments`. 
3. **Substring Relationship**: For the given example, the `url` does not appear as a substring of `deployments_url` because the scheme (`https`) and the path structure differ. The `deployments_url` is a specific endpoint that includes `/deployments` at the end, which means it cannot be a substring of the `url`.
4. **General Case**: This relationship will not hold for all repositories, as the `url` and `deployments_url` are constructed differently and do not guarantee that one will always be a substring of the other. 

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not hold true for the provided example and cannot be generalized to all valid responses from the API, it is classified as a false-positive.

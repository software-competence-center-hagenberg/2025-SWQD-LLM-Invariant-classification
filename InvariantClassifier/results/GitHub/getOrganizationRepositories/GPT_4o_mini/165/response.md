### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for listing repositories of a specified organization. The response schema indicates that the response will be an array of objects, each containing a `permissions` object with two boolean properties: `push` and `triage`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.permissions.push == return.permissions.triage`, which implies that the value of `push` must always equal the value of `triage` in the response.

### Analysis
The properties `push` and `triage` are both boolean values, which means they can either be `true` or `false`. However, there is no indication in the Swagger definition that these two properties are inherently linked or should always have the same value. In practice, it is entirely possible for one permission to be granted (true) while the other is not (false), depending on the organization's configuration and the specific repositories being accessed. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, as there can be valid responses where `push` and `triage` have different values.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant does not hold true for all valid responses from the API, it is classified as a false-positive.

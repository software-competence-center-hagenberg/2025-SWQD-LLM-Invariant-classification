### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for listing repositories of a specified organization. The response is expected to be an array of repository objects, each containing a `url` and a `merges_url`. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.url` is a substring of `return.merges_url`. This means that the URL of the repository should always appear within the merges URL of that repository.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Fields**: 
   - `return.url`: This is the URL of the repository, e.g., `https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World`.
   - `return.merges_url`: This is the URL for merging, e.g., `http://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/merges`.

2. **Evaluating the Invariant**: 
   - For the given example, `return.url` is `https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World` and `return.merges_url` is `http://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/merges`.
   - The `return.url` does not appear as a substring in `return.merges_url` because the scheme (`https`) and the domain (`api.github.com`) differ between the two URLs. 
   - Additionally, the invariant would not hold for other repositories either, as the merges URL typically has a different structure and may not include the full repository URL.

### Conclusion
The invariant that `return.url` is a substring of `return.merges_url` does not hold true for the given API response structure. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

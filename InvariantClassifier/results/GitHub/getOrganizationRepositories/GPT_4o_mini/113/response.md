### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/orgs/{org}/repos` that returns a list of repositories for a specified organization. The response schema indicates that each repository object contains at least two properties: `full_name` and `ssh_url`. Both properties are strings, where `full_name` represents the full name of the repository (e.g., `octocat/Hello-World`) and `ssh_url` represents the SSH URL for accessing the repository.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.full_name` is a substring of `return.ssh_url`. This means that the value of `full_name` should appear within the value of `ssh_url` for every repository returned by this endpoint.

### Analysis
To evaluate the validity of this invariant, we need to consider the typical formats of `full_name` and `ssh_url`:
- The `full_name` of a repository is usually formatted as `owner/repo` (e.g., `octocat/Hello-World`).
- The `ssh_url` for a repository typically follows the format `git@github.com:owner/repo.git` (e.g., `git@github.com:octocat/Hello-World.git`).

From this, we can see that while the `full_name` does contain the `owner/repo` structure, it is not a substring of the `ssh_url` because the `ssh_url` includes additional characters (like `git@github.com:` and `.git`). Therefore, `full_name` cannot be found as a substring within `ssh_url` in the general case.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not hold for every valid response from the API (as `full_name` is not a substring of `ssh_url`), the invariant is classified as a false-positive.

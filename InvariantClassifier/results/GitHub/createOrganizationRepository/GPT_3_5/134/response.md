- The request body is not specified in the excerpt.
- The response schema includes a field `subscription_url` of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that `return.subscription_url` is Url, indicating that the value of the `subscription_url` field in the response body is always a URL.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided excerpt, there is no explicit information about the format or content of the `subscription_url` field.
- The excerpt does not provide details about the expected format or content of the `subscription_url` field in the response.

## Conclusion

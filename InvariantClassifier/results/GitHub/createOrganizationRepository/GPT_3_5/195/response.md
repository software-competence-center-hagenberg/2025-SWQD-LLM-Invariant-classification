## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a POST request to create a new repository in a specified organization.
- The request requires OAuth scope requirements for authorization.
- The response includes a URL and a statuses URL for the newly created repository.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the return.url is a substring of return.statuses_url.

## Analysis
- The provided swagger definition does not explicitly mention the relationship between the return.url and return.statuses_url.
- Without further context or specification in the swagger definition, it is not possible to determine if the invariant holds true for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
- The invariant is a false-positive as it cannot be verified based on the information provided in the swagger definition.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition excerpt describes a POST request to create an organization repository. The request requires OAuth scope requirements for authorization.

## Invariant

The invariant `return.permissions.admin == return.has_downloads` checks if the `admin` permission is equal to the `has_downloads` property in the response.

## Analysis

The provided Swagger excerpt does not include the complete response schema, so it is not possible to verify if the `permissions` and `has_downloads` properties exist in the response. Additionally, the OAuth scope requirements are related to authorization and do not directly impact the comparison of `permissions.admin` and `has_downloads`.

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the invariant cannot be verified with the provided information. Therefore, the invariant is classified as false-positive.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/orgs/{org}/repos"
  post:
    summary: Create an organization repository
    description: Creates a new repository in the specified organization. The authenticated user must be a member of the organization.
    
    **OAuth scope requirements**
    
    When using [OAuth](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/), authorizations must include:
    
    *   `public_repo` scope or `repo` scope to create a public repository. Note: For GitHub AE, use `repo` scope to create an internal repository.
    *   `repo` scope to create a private repository
    parameters:
    requestBody:
        schema:
          type: object
    responses:
      '201':
        description: Creates a new repository in the specified organization. The authenticated user must be a member of the organization.

        schema:
          type: object
          description: A git repository
          properties:
            pushed_at:
              type: string
              example: 2011-01-26T19:06:43Z


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.pushed_at is Timestamp. Format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmZ (Miliseconds are optional)

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.dates.IsTimestampYYYYMMHHThhmmssmm
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable is always a timestamp. Represented as x is Timestamp. Format
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

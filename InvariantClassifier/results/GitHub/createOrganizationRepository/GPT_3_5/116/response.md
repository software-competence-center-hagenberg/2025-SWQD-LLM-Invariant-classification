## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the `forks_url` field in the response is a URL.

## Analysis
The invariant is true-positive. The `forks_url` field in the response schema is explicitly defined as a string and represents a URL. Therefore, the invariant holds for every valid response to the POST request.

## Conclusion

The invariant `return.forks == return.subscribers_count` is a false-positive. This is because the invariant is specific to the response body fields `forks` and `subscribers_count`, and it may not hold true for every valid request on the API. The presence of these fields in the response body is not guaranteed by the API specification, and their values are not necessarily related in a way that ensures equality. Therefore, this invariant cannot be classified as true-positive.

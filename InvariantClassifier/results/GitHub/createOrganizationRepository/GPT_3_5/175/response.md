## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The provided Swagger definition describes a POST request to create a new repository in a specified organization.
- The request requires OAuth scope requirements for authorization.
- The response contains a URL and a contributors URL for the newly created repository.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the 'url' in the response is a substring of 'contributors_url'.

## Analysis
- The provided Swagger definition does not explicitly mention any relationship between the 'url' and 'contributors_url'.
- The 'url' and 'contributors_url' are both properties of the response object, but there is no indication that one should be a substring of the other.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the Swagger definition, the invariant 'return.url is a substring of return.contributors_url' is a false-positive. There is no evidence in the Swagger definition to support this invariant.

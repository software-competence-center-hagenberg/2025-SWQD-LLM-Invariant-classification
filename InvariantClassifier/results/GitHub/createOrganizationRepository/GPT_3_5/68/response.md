The invariant return.template_repository == null checks if the field 'template_repository' in the response body is null. This is a valid check to ensure that no template repository is returned in the response. Given the information provided in the Swagger definition, there is no indication that the 'template_repository' field should always be null or non-null. Therefore, this invariant is a true-positive as it holds for every valid request on the API.

The given invariant checks if the 'url' field in the response is a substring of the 'following_url' field in the response. The 'url' and 'following_url' fields are properties of the 'owner' object in the response. The invariant type is daikon.inv.binary.twoString.StdString$SubString, which represents the substring invariant between two String scalars. The invariant is based on the response body fields.

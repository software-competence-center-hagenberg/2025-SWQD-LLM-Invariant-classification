### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint for creating a repository in a specified organization. The response schema indicates that the response will include an `owner` object and an `organization` object, both of which contain a `following_url` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `following_url` of the `owner` object must be equal to the `following_url` of the `organization` object: `return.owner.following_url == return.organization.following_url`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Objects**: The `owner` and `organization` are distinct entities. The `owner` typically refers to the user who owns the repository, while the `organization` refers to the organization under which the repository is created.
2. **Properties of the Objects**: Each of these objects can have different `following_url` values. For example, if the repository is owned by a user who is not part of the organization, their `following_url` will differ from that of the organization.
3. **Use Case Scenarios**: In scenarios where the repository is created under an organization, the `owner` could be a user who is a member of that organization, but their `following_url` would still be unique to their user profile, which is not guaranteed to match the organization's `following_url`.

### Conclusion
Given that the `owner` and `organization` are separate entities with potentially different `following_url` values, the invariant `return.owner.following_url == return.organization.following_url` does not hold true for every valid request on the API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

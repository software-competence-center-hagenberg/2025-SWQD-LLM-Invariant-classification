### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a repository in a specified organization. The response schema indicates that the response will include two properties: `url` and `deployments_url`, both of which are strings. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.url` is a substring of `return.deployments_url`. 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**:
   - `return.url`: This is the URL of the newly created repository. For example, it might look like `https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World`.
   - `return.deployments_url`: This is the URL for accessing the deployments of the repository. It typically follows a pattern like `http://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/deployments`.

2. **Substring Relationship**:
   - For the example given, `return.url` is `https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World` and `return.deployments_url` is `http://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/deployments`.
   - The `url` does not appear as a substring in `deployments_url` because the scheme (`https://` vs `http://`) and the path structure differ. 
   - In fact, `return.url` will not be a substring of `return.deployments_url` in general, as the two URLs serve different purposes and have different structures.

### Conclusion
The invariant that `return.url` is a substring of `return.deployments_url` does not hold true for every valid response from this API endpoint. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided excerpt from the Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint for creating a repository within an organization. The response schema indicates that the response will include an `html_url` property, which is a string representing the URL of the created repository. However, there is no mention of an `owner` object or its `html_url` property in the response schema.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.owner.html_url` is a substring of `return.html_url`. This implies that the `owner` object must exist in the response and that its `html_url` must be a part of the `html_url` of the repository.

### Analysis
1. **Response Schema**: The response schema only defines `html_url` as a property of the repository. There is no indication that an `owner` object is included in the response.
2. **Owner Information**: Typically, in a GitHub-like API, the `owner` of a repository would be an object that contains information about the user or organization that owns the repository. However, since the Swagger definition does not include this information, we cannot assume it exists in the response.
3. **Substring Relationship**: For the invariant to hold true, both `return.owner.html_url` and `return.html_url` must exist. Since `return.owner.html_url` does not exist in the response schema, the invariant cannot be validated.

### Conclusion
Given that the response schema does not include an `owner` object or its `html_url`, the invariant that `return.owner.html_url` is a substring of `return.html_url` cannot hold true for every valid request on the API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

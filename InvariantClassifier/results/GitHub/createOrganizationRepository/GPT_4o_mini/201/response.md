### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint for creating a repository within an organization. The response schema includes two properties: `url` and `hooks_url`. 

- `url`: This is the URL of the created repository.
- `hooks_url`: This is the URL for the hooks associated with the repository.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.url` is a substring of `return.hooks_url`. This means that the URL of the repository should be contained within the hooks URL of the repository.

### Analysis
To evaluate the invariant, we need to consider the structure of the URLs:
- The `url` typically follows the format: `https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}`.
- The `hooks_url` typically follows the format: `http://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/hooks`.

From this structure, we can see that the `hooks_url` contains the `url` as it includes the same base URL and repository path, with an additional `/hooks` suffix. Therefore, `return.url` is indeed a substring of `return.hooks_url` for valid repository URLs.

However, this invariant assumes that the URLs are always formatted correctly and that the repository names do not contain any special characters that could affect substring matching. Given the standard structure of GitHub URLs, this invariant holds true.

### Conclusion
The invariant that `return.url` is a substring of `return.hooks_url` is correct based on the standard URL structure provided in the Swagger definition. Therefore, it is classified as a **true-positive**.

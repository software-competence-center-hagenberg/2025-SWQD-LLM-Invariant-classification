### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint for creating a repository within an organization. The response schema includes two properties: `full_name` and `url`. The `full_name` is expected to be in the format of `owner/repo`, while the `url` is the API endpoint for accessing that repository.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.full_name` is a substring of `return.url`. This means that the value of `full_name` should appear somewhere within the `url` string.

### Analysis
1. **Structure of `full_name`**: The `full_name` is structured as `owner/repo`, which means it contains a forward slash. For example, if `full_name` is `octocat/Hello-World`, it would be expected to appear in the URL.
2. **Structure of `url`**: The `url` is structured as `https://api.github.com/repos/{full_name}`, which means that the `full_name` will indeed be part of the `url` after the `/repos/` segment. For example, if `full_name` is `octocat/Hello-World`, the `url` would be `https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World`.
3. **Substring Relationship**: Given the structure of both `full_name` and `url`, it is clear that `full_name` will always be a substring of `url` as long as the repository is created correctly and follows the expected naming conventions.

### Conclusion
The invariant that `return.full_name` is a substring of `return.url` holds true for every valid request to this API endpoint, as the `url` is constructed using the `full_name`. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

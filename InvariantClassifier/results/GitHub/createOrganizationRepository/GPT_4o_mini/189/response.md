### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint for creating a repository in a specified organization. The response includes two properties: `url` and `merges_url`. 

- `url`: This is the URL of the newly created repository.
- `merges_url`: This is the URL that can be used to access the merges of the repository.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.url` is a substring of `return.merges_url`. This means that the URL of the repository should be contained within the merges URL.

### Analysis
To evaluate the invariant, we need to consider the structure of the URLs:
- The `url` typically follows the format: `https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}`.
- The `merges_url` typically follows the format: `http://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/merges`.

From the above formats, it is clear that the `merges_url` is constructed by appending `/merges` to the `url`. Therefore, the `url` will always be a substring of `merges_url` because the `merges_url` contains the full `url` followed by the additional path segment `/merges`.

### Conclusion
Given that the structure of the URLs guarantees that `return.url` will always be a substring of `return.merges_url`, the invariant is correct. Thus, it is classified as a true-positive.

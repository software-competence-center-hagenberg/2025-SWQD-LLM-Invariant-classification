### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a repository within a specified organization. The response includes two fields: `url` and `contributors_url`. The `url` field represents the API endpoint for the created repository, while the `contributors_url` field provides a URL to access the contributors of that repository.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.url` is a substring of `return.contributors_url`. This means that the URL of the repository should be part of the contributors' URL.

### Analysis
1. **Structure of URLs**: The `url` typically follows the format `https://api.github.com/repos/{org}/{repo}`. The `contributors_url` usually follows the format `http://api.github.com/repos/{org}/{repo}/contributors`. 
2. **Substring Relationship**: For the invariant to hold true, the `url` must be a substring of the `contributors_url`. Given the typical structure, the `url` does not appear as a substring of `contributors_url`. Instead, `contributors_url` contains the `url` followed by `/contributors`.
3. **Example**: If we take an example where `url` is `https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World`, the `contributors_url` would be `http://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/contributors`. Here, `url` is not a substring of `contributors_url` because of the differing protocols (`https` vs `http`) and the additional path segment `/contributors`.

### Conclusion
The invariant stating that `return.url` is a substring of `return.contributors_url` is incorrect based on the typical structure of these URLs in the API response. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

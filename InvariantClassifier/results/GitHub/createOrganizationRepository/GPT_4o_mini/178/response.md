### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a repository in a specified organization. The response schema indicates that the response will contain two properties: `url` and `events_url`. 

- `url`: This is a string that represents the URL of the created repository.
- `events_url`: This is a string that represents the URL for the events related to the repository.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.url` is a substring of `return.events_url`. This means that the URL of the repository should be contained within the events URL of that repository.

### Analysis
To evaluate the invariant, we need to consider the structure of the URLs:
- The `url` typically follows a pattern like `https://api.github.com/repos/{org}/{repo}`.
- The `events_url` usually follows a pattern like `https://api.github.com/repos/{org}/{repo}/events`.

From this structure, we can see that the `url` does not contain the `events_url` as a substring. Instead, the `events_url` is an extension of the `url`, meaning it includes the `url` followed by `/events`. Therefore, the invariant that `return.url` is a substring of `return.events_url` is incorrect. The correct relationship is that `return.events_url` is an extension of `return.url`.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant that `return.url` is a substring of `return.events_url` does not hold true for every valid request on the API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

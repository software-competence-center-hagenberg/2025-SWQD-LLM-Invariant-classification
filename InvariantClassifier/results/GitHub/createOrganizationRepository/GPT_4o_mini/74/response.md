### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided excerpt from the Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a repository within an organization. It specifies the OAuth scope requirements for creating public and private repositories and outlines the expected response schema, which includes a property called `squash_merge_commit_message`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.squash_merge_commit_message` can only take on one of the values: `"BLANK"`, `"COMMIT_MESSAGES"`, or `"PR_BODY"`.

### Analysis
1. **Response Schema**: The response schema indicates that `squash_merge_commit_message` is a string. However, it does not specify any constraints on the values that this string can take. 
2. **Possible Values**: While the invariant suggests that the value of `squash_merge_commit_message` is limited to three specific options, the Swagger definition does not provide any evidence or constraints that enforce this limitation. The absence of such constraints means that the API could potentially return any string value for `squash_merge_commit_message`, not just the specified ones.
3. **Conclusion**: Since the Swagger definition does not restrict the values of `squash_merge_commit_message` to the ones listed in the invariant, it is possible for the API to return values outside of this set. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** because it incorrectly assumes that the response field `squash_merge_commit_message` is limited to a specific set of values, which is not supported by the Swagger definition.

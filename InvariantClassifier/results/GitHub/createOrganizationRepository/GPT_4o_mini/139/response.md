### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a repository within an organization. It specifies the required OAuth scopes for creating public and private repositories and outlines the response structure, which includes a `hooks_url` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.hooks_url` is always a URL, represented as `return.hooks_url is Url`. This means that every time this endpoint is successfully called, the `hooks_url` field in the response should contain a valid URL.

### Analysis
The `hooks_url` property is defined as a string in the response schema, and it is provided as an example: `http://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/hooks`. This suggests that the `hooks_url` is intended to be a valid URL. However, the invariant claims that it is always a URL without exception. 

To determine if this invariant is a true-positive, we must consider the possibility of different scenarios:
1. **Successful Creation**: If the repository is created successfully, the `hooks_url` will likely be a valid URL pointing to the hooks for that repository.
2. **Error Responses**: If there are errors during the creation process (e.g., invalid organization, insufficient permissions), the response may not include the `hooks_url` or may return a different structure altogether, potentially leading to cases where `hooks_url` is not present or not a valid URL.

Given that the invariant does not account for all possible response scenarios, including error cases, it cannot be guaranteed that `return.hooks_url` is always a URL for every valid request.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a **false-positive** because it assumes that `return.hooks_url` will always be a URL without considering the possibility of error responses or other scenarios where the field may not be present or valid. Therefore, it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

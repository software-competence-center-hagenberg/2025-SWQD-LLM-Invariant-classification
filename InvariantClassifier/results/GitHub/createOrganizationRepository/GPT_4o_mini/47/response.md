### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a repository within an organization. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an `owner` and an `organization`, both of which are objects that include a `received_events_url` property. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `received_events_url` of the `owner` must be equal to the `received_events_url` of the `organization`:  
`return.owner.received_events_url == return.organization.received_events_url`

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that the `received_events_url` for both the `owner` and the `organization` will always be the same. However, this is not guaranteed by the API definition. The `owner` and `organization` can represent different entities (e.g., a user and an organization), and their `received_events_url` values can differ based on their respective user profiles. Therefore, it is entirely possible for the `received_events_url` of the `owner` to not match that of the `organization`. 

### Conclusion
Since there is no requirement or guarantee in the API definition that the `received_events_url` for the `owner` and `organization` must be equal, the invariant is incorrect. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

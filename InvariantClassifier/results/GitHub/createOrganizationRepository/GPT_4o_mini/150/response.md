### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST API endpoint for creating a repository within an organization. The response of this endpoint includes two fields: `full_name` and `html_url`. The `full_name` field represents the full name of the repository in the format `owner/repo`, while the `html_url` field provides the URL to access the repository on GitHub.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.full_name` is a substring of `return.html_url`. This means that the value of `full_name` should be found within the value of `html_url`.

### Analysis
To evaluate this invariant, we need to consider the structure of the `html_url`. The `html_url` is typically formatted as follows:
```
https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}
```
Given this format, if `full_name` is `octocat/Hello-World`, then `html_url` would be `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World`. In this case, `full_name` is indeed a substring of `html_url`.

However, we must consider whether this invariant holds for all possible values of `full_name` and `html_url`. The invariant will hold true as long as the `html_url` is constructed correctly based on the `full_name`. If the repository is created successfully, the `full_name` will always be part of the `html_url` as per the standard URL structure of GitHub repositories.

### Conclusion
Since the `html_url` is always constructed using the `full_name` of the repository, the invariant that `return.full_name` is a substring of `return.html_url` holds true for every valid request on this API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

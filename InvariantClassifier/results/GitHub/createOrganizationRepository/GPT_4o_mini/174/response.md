### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a REST endpoint for creating a repository in an organization. It specifies the required OAuth scopes for creating public and private repositories and outlines the structure of the response body, which includes two properties: `url` and `contents_url`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.url` is a substring of `return.contents_url`. This means that the value of the `url` field in the response should be contained within the value of the `contents_url` field.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Fields**:
   - `return.url`: This is the URL of the created repository, which typically follows the format `https://api.github.com/repos/{org}/{repo_name}`.
   - `return.contents_url`: This URL is structured as `http://api.github.com/repos/{org}/{repo_name}/contents/{+path}`. It is meant to access the contents of the repository.

2. **Substring Relationship**:
   - For the invariant to hold true, the `url` must be a substring of `contents_url`. However, analyzing the structure:
     - `return.url` might look like `https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World`.
     - `return.contents_url` would look like `http://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/contents/{+path}`.
   - The key point here is that `return.url` starts with `https://` while `return.contents_url` starts with `http://`. Therefore, `return.url` cannot be a substring of `return.contents_url` due to the differing protocols and the additional path in `contents_url`.

### Conclusion
The invariant stating that `return.url` is a substring of `return.contents_url` is incorrect as the two URLs have different formats and structures. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/artists/{id}/albums" has a GET operation that retrieves an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes a field "items" which is an array of albums, and each album has a field "id" which represents the Spotify ID for the album.
- The response also includes a field "href" which is a link to the Web API endpoint returning the full result of the request.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the "id" of each album in the response should be a substring of the "href".

## Analysis
The provided invariant is false-positive. The Spotify ID for an album is not necessarily a substring of the "href". The "href" is a link to the Web API endpoint and is not directly related to the album ID.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive
The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API as the album ID being a substring of the "href" is not a valid assumption.

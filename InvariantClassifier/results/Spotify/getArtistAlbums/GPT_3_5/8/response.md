## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided excerpt of the Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums. The response schema includes a field 'items' which contains an array of albums, and each album has a field 'external_urls' that represents known external URLs for the album.

## Invariant
The invariant is 'return.external_urls != null', which checks if the 'external_urls' field in the response is not null.

## Analysis
The invariant 'return.external_urls != null' is a true-positive for this REST endpoint. Since the 'external_urls' field is described as known external URLs for the album, it is expected to be present in the response for each album. Therefore, the invariant holds true for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive

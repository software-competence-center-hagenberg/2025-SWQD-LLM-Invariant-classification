## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes a field 'items' which contains an array of artists.
- Each artist object in the array has a field 'type' which is a string representing the object type.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.type == "artist"' checks if the 'type' field of each artist object in the response is equal to 'artist'.

## Analysis
- The invariant is true-positive.
- The response schema guarantees that the 'type' field exists for each artist object, and it is of type string.
- The invariant ensures that only artist objects are included in the response, which aligns with the API's purpose of retrieving artist albums.

## Conclusion
Based on the response schema and the purpose of the API endpoint, the invariant 'return.type == "artist"' is true-positive.

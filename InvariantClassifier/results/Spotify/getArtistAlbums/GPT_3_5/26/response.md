## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing the fields 'total_tracks' and 'available_markets'.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.total_tracks != size(return.available_markets[])' checks if the number of total tracks in an album is not equal to the number of available markets for that album.

## Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive because it assumes a direct correlation between the number of total tracks and the number of available markets, which may not always hold true. An album with a large number of tracks may still be available in a limited number of markets, and vice versa.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API as it makes an incorrect assumption about the relationship between total tracks and available markets.

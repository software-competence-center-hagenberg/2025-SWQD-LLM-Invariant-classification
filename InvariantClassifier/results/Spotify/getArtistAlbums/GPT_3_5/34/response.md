The invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant assumes a specific relationship between the sizes of 'available_markets' and 'images' arrays in the response, but the Swagger definition does not guarantee this relationship. The invariant type 'daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual' specifies that the size of 'available_markets' array minus 1 should not be equal to the size of the 'images' array, but there is no indication in the Swagger definition that such a relationship holds true for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

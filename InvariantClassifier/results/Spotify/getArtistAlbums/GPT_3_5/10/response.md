## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes a property 'items' which is an array of albums.
- Each album object in the 'items' array contains an 'images' property, which is an array of cover art images.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.images[] elements != null' checks if all the elements in the 'images' array of each album are not null.

## Analysis
The invariant is true-positive. The response schema ensures that the 'images' array exists for each album, and the properties within the 'images' array have descriptions indicating that they may be null. Therefore, the invariant holds true for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive

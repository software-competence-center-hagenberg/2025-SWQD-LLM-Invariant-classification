The invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant assumes a specific relationship between the size of the 'include_groups' parameter in the request and the size of the 'available_markets' array in the response. However, the Swagger definition does not guarantee this relationship. The 'include_groups' parameter is a filter for album types, and its size may not necessarily be related to the size of the 'available_markets' array in the response. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

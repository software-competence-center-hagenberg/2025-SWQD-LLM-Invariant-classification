## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint is a GET request to "/artists/{id}/albums" with a query parameter "limit".
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing an array of images.

## Invariant
- The invariant is input.limit >= size(return.images[])-1, which means that the value of the query parameter "limit" should be greater than or equal to the number of images returned minus 1.

## Analysis
- The response schema does include an array of images, and the invariant checks if the value of "limit" is sufficient to cover the number of images returned.
- However, the response schema does not provide a direct field named "images" under the path "items". Instead, it contains an array of items, each with an array of images.
- The invariant assumes a direct field "images" under "items", which is not present in the response schema.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it assumes a structure in the response schema that does not match the actual structure. Therefore, it will not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' has a GET operation with a 'market' query parameter.
- The response schema includes a 'href' field of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the 'market' query parameter should be a substring of the 'href' field in the response.

## Analysis
- The 'market' query parameter is used to filter the albums based on the specified market (country code).
- The 'href' field in the response is a link to the Web API endpoint returning the full result of the request.
- The invariant is false-positive because there is no direct relationship between the 'market' query parameter and the 'href' field in the response. The 'market' parameter filters the albums returned, but it is not necessarily related to the 'href' field in the response.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive

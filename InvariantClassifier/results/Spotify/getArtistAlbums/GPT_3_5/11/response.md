## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes an array of items, where each item has a type property of type string, representing the object type 'album'.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.type == "album"' checks if the type property of each item in the response is equal to 'album'.

## Analysis
Given the response schema, the invariant 'return.type == "album"' is true-positive. The schema specifies that the type property of each item in the response is indeed 'album', and there are no other possible values for the type property.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive

The invariant holds true for every valid request on the API, as the response schema guarantees that the type property of each item is always 'album'.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is defined with a GET method.
- The response schema includes a property 'items' which is an array of objects.
- Each object in the 'items' array contains a property 'images' which is an array of objects representing cover art for the album.

## Invariant
The invariant 'size(return.images[]) == 3' checks if the number of images for each album is exactly 3.

## Analysis
The response schema does not guarantee that the number of images for each album will always be 3. It only specifies the structure of the response, not the exact number of images. Therefore, the invariant 'size(return.images[]) == 3' is a false-positive.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive
The invariant 'size(return.images[]) == 3' is incorrect as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

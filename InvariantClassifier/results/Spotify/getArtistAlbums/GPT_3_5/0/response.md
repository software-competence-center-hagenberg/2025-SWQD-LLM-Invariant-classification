## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes a field 'items' which contains an array of 'artists'.
- Each 'artist' object has a field 'external_urls'.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.external_urls != null' checks if the 'external_urls' field in the response is not null.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'external_urls' field is nested within the 'items.artists' array in the response. Therefore, the invariant 'return.external_urls != null' is not applicable directly to the response object. It should be applied to each individual 'artist' object within the 'items.artists' array.

## Conclusion
The invariant 'return.external_urls != null' is false-positive because it does not accurately capture the structure of the response. It should be modified to account for the nested structure of the response.

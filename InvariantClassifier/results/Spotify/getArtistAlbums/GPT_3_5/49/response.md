## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided excerpt of the swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums. The response schema includes two properties: 'limit' and 'total', both of type integer.

## Invariant
The invariant states that 'return.limit != return.total', meaning that the number of items in the response should not be equal to the total number of items available to return.

## Analysis
Given the provided swagger definition, the invariant 'return.limit != return.total' is a false-positive. This is because the 'limit' property in the response schema represents the maximum number of items in the response, while the 'total' property represents the total number of items available to return. It is possible for the number of items in the response to be less than the total number of items available, making 'return.limit != return.total' an incorrect invariant.

## Conclusion
The invariant 'return.limit != return.total' is a false-positive for the given REST endpoint.

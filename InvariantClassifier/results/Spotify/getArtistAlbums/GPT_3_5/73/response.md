## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes an array of items, where each item has a 'type' and 'uri' field.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.type is a substring of return.uri' checks if the 'type' field is a substring of the 'uri' field within the 'items' array in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'type' and 'uri' fields are both present within the 'items' array in the response schema. Therefore, the invariant 'return.type is a substring of return.uri' is a valid check to ensure that the 'type' field is a substring of the 'uri' field for each item in the response.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
The invariant is true-positive as it holds for every valid request on the API, given that the 'type' field is a substring of the 'uri' field within the 'items' array in the response.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' has a GET method to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes a field 'items.images' which contains an array of cover art for the albums, with each item having a 'height' field.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.height one of { 64, 300, 640 }' specifies that the 'height' field in the 'items.images' array should have one of the values 64, 300, or 640.

## Analysis
- The response schema does not guarantee that the 'height' field in the 'items.images' array will always have one of the specified values (64, 300, 640).
- The 'height' field may have other values not specified in the invariant.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

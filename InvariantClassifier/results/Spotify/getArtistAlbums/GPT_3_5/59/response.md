## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes a 'href' field of type string and an 'items' field of type array, which contains an 'artists' field of type array.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.type is a substring of return.href' checks if the 'type' field in the 'items.artists' array is a substring of the 'href' field in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition, there is no 'type' field directly under 'items.artists'. Therefore, the invariant 'return.type is a substring of return.href' is false-positive.

## Conclusion
The invariant is false-positive because there is no 'type' field directly under 'items.artists' in the response.

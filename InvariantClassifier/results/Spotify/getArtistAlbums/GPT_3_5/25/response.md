## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' has a GET operation with a 'market' query parameter.
- The response schema includes a field 'available_markets' which is an array of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.market in return.available_markets[]
This means that the 'market' query parameter in the request should be a member of the 'available_markets' array in the response.

## Analysis
Given the definition of the endpoint and the response schema, the invariant holds true. The 'market' parameter in the request should indeed be a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, and the response should include the 'available_markets' array which contains these country codes.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
The invariant is correct and holds for every valid request on the API.

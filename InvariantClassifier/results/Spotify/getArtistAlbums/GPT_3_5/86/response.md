## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided excerpt of the Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums. The response schema includes a property 'limit' which represents the maximum number of items in the response.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.limit >= 1' specifies that the 'limit' field in the response must be greater than or equal to 1.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger excerpt, the 'limit' field in the response is described as the maximum number of items in the response. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the 'limit' should be greater than or equal to 1, as an empty response (limit=0) would not be meaningful in this context.

## Conclusion
The invariant 'return.limit >= 1' is classified as true-positive, as it aligns with the expected behavior of the API and is necessary for the response to be meaningful.

The invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the size of the 'include_groups' parameter in the request does not necessarily have a direct relationship with the size of the 'available_markets' array in the response. The 'include_groups' parameter is used to filter the albums based on their types, and it does not dictate the number of available markets for the albums returned. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

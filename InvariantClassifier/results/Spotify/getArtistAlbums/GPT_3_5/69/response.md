## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a 'uri' field of type string.

## Invariant
- LENGTH(return.uri)==36
- This invariant specifies that the length of the 'uri' field in the response must always be 36 characters.

## Analysis
- The Swagger definition does not explicitly enforce a fixed length of 36 characters for the 'uri' field.
- The length of the 'uri' field is not constrained in the response schema.
- Therefore, the invariant LENGTH(return.uri)==36 is a false-positive.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes a field 'items' which contains an array of artists.
- Each artist object in the 'items' array contains an 'id' field and a 'href' field.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.id is a substring of return.href' checks if the 'id' of an artist is a substring of the 'href' for that artist.

## Analysis
- The 'id' field in the artist object is a unique identifier for the artist.
- The 'href' field is a link to the Web API endpoint returning the full result of the request.
- It is not guaranteed that the 'id' of an artist will be a substring of the 'href'.
- The 'id' and 'href' fields are independent and may not have a substring relationship.

## Conclusion
The invariant 'return.id is a substring of return.href' is a false-positive. It does not hold for every valid request on the API as the 'id' and 'href' fields are not necessarily related in a substring manner.

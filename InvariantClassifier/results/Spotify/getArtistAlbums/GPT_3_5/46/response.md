### Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' has a GET method with a 'offset' query parameter.
- The response schema includes a 'total' field of type integer.

### Invariant
- The invariant 'input.offset != return.total' checks if the 'offset' parameter in the request is not equal to the 'total' field in the response.

### Analysis
- The 'offset' parameter in the request is used to specify the index of the first item to return, and it is unrelated to the 'total' field in the response.
- The 'total' field in the response represents the total number of items available to return.
- There is no direct relationship between the 'offset' parameter and the 'total' field, so the invariant 'input.offset != return.total' is a false-positive.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'input.offset != return.total' is a false-positive for the given REST API endpoint.

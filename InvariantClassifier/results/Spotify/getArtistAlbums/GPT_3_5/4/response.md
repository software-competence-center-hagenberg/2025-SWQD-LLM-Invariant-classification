## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' has a GET method with a 'limit' query parameter.
- The response schema includes an array of 'images' with each image having a 'height' field.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'input.limit < return.height' states that the 'limit' parameter in the request should be less than the 'height' of the images returned in the response.

## Analysis
- The 'limit' parameter in the request is used to specify the maximum number of items to return, and it is unrelated to the 'height' of the images in the response.
- The 'height' of the images in the response is not directly related to the 'limit' parameter in the request.

## Conclusion
The invariant 'input.limit < return.height' is a false-positive because there is no direct relationship between the 'limit' parameter in the request and the 'height' of the images in the response.

Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes a field 'items' which contains an array of 'artists'.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.artists != null' checks if the 'artists' field in the response is not null.

Analysis:
- The response schema does include a field 'items' which contains an array of 'artists', so the 'artists' field will not be null if the response is successful.

Conclusion:
Based on the provided Swagger definition and the invariant, the invariant 'return.artists != null' is a true-positive, as it holds for every valid request on the API.

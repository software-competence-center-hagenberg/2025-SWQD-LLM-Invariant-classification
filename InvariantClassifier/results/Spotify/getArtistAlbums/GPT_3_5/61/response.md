## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes a field 'items.artists' which is an array of objects.
- Each object in 'items.artists' has a 'type' field and a 'uri' field.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.type is a substring of return.uri' checks if the 'type' field is a substring of the 'uri' field within the 'items.artists' array in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'type' and 'uri' fields are both present in the 'items.artists' array, and both are of type string. Therefore, the invariant 'return.type is a substring of return.uri' is applicable to the response schema.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive
The invariant is true-positive because for every valid response to the endpoint, the 'type' field will be a substring of the 'uri' field within the 'items.artists' array.

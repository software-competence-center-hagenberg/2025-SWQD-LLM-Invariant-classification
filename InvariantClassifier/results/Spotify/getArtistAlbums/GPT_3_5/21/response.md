The invariant input.offset != size(return.available_markets[]) is a false-positive. This is because the size of return.available_markets[] is determined by the data in the response and is not directly related to the input.offset parameter. The size of available_markets[] is not controlled by the input.offset parameter, so the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

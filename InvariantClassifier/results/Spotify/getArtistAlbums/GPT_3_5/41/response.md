## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes a 'total' field of type integer.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.total >= 0' specifies that the 'total' field in the response must be greater than or equal to 0.

## Analysis
- The 'total' field is expected to represent the total number of items available to return, and it makes sense for this value to be non-negative.
- Since the invariant 'return.total >= 0' aligns with the expected behavior of the API, it is classified as a true-positive invariant.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.total >= 0' is classified as a true-positive.

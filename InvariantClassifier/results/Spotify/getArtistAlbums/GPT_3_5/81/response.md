## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums` has a GET operation with a `market` query parameter.
- The response schema includes a `next` property of type string, which represents the URL to the next page of items.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the `input.market` (request parameter) should be a substring of `return.next` (response property).

## Analysis
- The `market` query parameter is used to filter the albums based on the specified market (country code).
- The `next` property in the response represents the URL to the next page of items.
- The invariant ensures that the `next` URL returned is related to the specified market in the request.
- However, the presence of the `market` query parameter does not guarantee that the `next` URL will always be related to that market. The relationship between the market and the next URL is not explicitly defined in the API documentation.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it assumes a relationship between the `market` query parameter and the `next` URL that is not guaranteed by the API specification.

The invariant states that the size of 'available_markets' in the response should not be equal to the size of 'artists' minus 1. This means that for every response, the number of available markets should not be one less than the number of artists. However, based on the provided Swagger definition, there is no explicit relationship between the 'available_markets' and 'artists' arrays that would guarantee this invariant to hold true for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive.

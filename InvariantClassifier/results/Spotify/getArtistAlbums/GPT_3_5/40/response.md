## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes a field 'offset' of type integer with a description.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.offset >= 0' specifies that the 'offset' field in the response must be greater than or equal to 0.

## Analysis
- The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that the 'offset' field will always be greater than or equal to 0.
- The invariant assumes that the 'offset' field will always be non-negative, but this is not guaranteed by the definition.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant 'return.offset >= 0' is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API, as it is not guaranteed by the Swagger definition.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes a field 'items.artists' which contains an array of artists, each with 'id' and 'uri' fields.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.id is a substring of return.uri' checks if the 'id' of an artist is a substring of the 'uri' for that artist in the response.

## Analysis
- The response schema does not guarantee that the 'id' of an artist will be a substring of the 'uri' for that artist. The 'id' and 'uri' fields are independent and may not have a substring relationship.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant 'return.id is a substring of return.uri' is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

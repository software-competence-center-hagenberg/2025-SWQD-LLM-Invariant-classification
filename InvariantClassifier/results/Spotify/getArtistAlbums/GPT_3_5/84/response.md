## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums from the Spotify API. The response schema includes an array of items, each of which contains an array of images.

## Invariant
The invariant specifies that the size of the array return.images[] should be one of {1, 3}.

## Analysis
The invariant is false-positive. The response schema does not guarantee that the array of images will always have a size of 1 or 3. It allows for any number of images to be returned for an album, and the size is not constrained to be 1 or 3.

## Conclusion
The invariant is false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

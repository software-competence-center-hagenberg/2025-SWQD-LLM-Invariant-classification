## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/artists/{id}/albums' is a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums.
- The response schema includes a property 'href' of type string, which represents a link to the Web API endpoint returning the full result of the request.

## Invariant
The invariant is: input.id is a substring of return.href

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the 'id' provided in the request is a substring of the 'href' returned in the response. This is a valid check to ensure that the 'href' returned is related to the 'id' requested.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive

The invariant is true-positive because it ensures that the 'href' returned in the response is related to the 'id' provided in the request. This relationship is essential for the correctness of the API response.

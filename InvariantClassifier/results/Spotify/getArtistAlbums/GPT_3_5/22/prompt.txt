Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/artists/{id}/albums"
  get:
    description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
    parameters:
      - name: offset
        in: query
        description: The index of the first item to return
        type: integer
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                available_markets:
                  type: array
                  description: The markets in which the album is available: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes. Note that an album is considered available in a market when at least 1 of its tracks is available in that market.
                  items:
                    type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.offset != size(return.available_markets[])-1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual

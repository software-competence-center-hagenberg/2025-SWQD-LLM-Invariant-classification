## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve an artist's albums. The response schema includes a field 'items' which contains an array of albums. Each album object in the array contains a field 'images' which is an array of cover art images.

## Invariant

The invariant 'return.images != null' checks if the 'images' field in each album object is not null.

## Analysis

Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'images' field is described as an array of cover art for the album, and it is not explicitly marked as a required field. Therefore, it is possible for an album object to have a null value for the 'images' field.

## Conclusion

The invariant 'return.images != null' is a false-positive for this REST API, as it does not hold for every valid request. The 'images' field in an album object can be null, making the invariant incorrect.

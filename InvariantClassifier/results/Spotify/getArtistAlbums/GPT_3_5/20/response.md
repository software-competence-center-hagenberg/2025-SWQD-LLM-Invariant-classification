The invariant input.limit > size(return.artists[]) is false-positive. The reason for this is that the 'limit' parameter in the request specifies the maximum number of items to return, and it does not guarantee that the number of returned artists will be less than the specified limit. The 'limit' parameter only serves as a maximum constraint, and the actual number of returned artists can be less than or equal to the specified limit. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will be an object containing an array of items, where each item represents an album. Each album item has a `type` and a `uri` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.type` is a substring of `return.uri`. This means that for every album returned in the response, the value of the `type` field should be found within the value of the `uri` field.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Fields**: According to the schema, the `type` field for each album is a string that indicates the object type, which is specified as 'album'. The `uri` field is a string that represents the Spotify URI for the album.
2. **Example Values**: For example, if the `type` is 'album', the `uri` could be something like 'spotify:album:12345'. In this case, 'album' is not a substring of 'spotify:album:12345'. 
3. **General Case**: The invariant suggests that this relationship holds for all possible values of `type` and `uri`. However, since the `uri` is a unique identifier that does not necessarily contain the `type` as a substring, this invariant will not hold true for all valid responses. 

### Conclusion
The invariant that `return.type` is a substring of `return.uri` is incorrect because there are valid cases where the `type` ('album') does not appear in the `uri` (e.g., 'spotify:album:12345'). Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

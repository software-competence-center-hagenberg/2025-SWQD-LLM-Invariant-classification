### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums. The endpoint accepts a query parameter `include_groups`, which is an array intended to filter the album types returned in the response. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an `items` array, where each item has an `album_group` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.album_group` (which refers to the `album_group` property of each item in the response) is always a member of the `input.include_groups[]` array (the query parameter).

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that every `album_group` returned in the response will be present in the `include_groups` array provided in the request. However, the `include_groups` parameter is used to filter the albums returned by the API, meaning that it is possible for the API to return albums that do not match the specified `include_groups`. If the `include_groups` parameter is empty or not provided, the API may return albums of any type, including those not in the `include_groups` array. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that every `album_group` in the response will be a member of the `include_groups` array.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not hold for every valid request (specifically when `include_groups` is empty or not specified), the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will be an object containing an `items` property, which is an array of album objects. Each album object can contain an `images` property, which is also an array of image objects.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.images != null`, which implies that the `images` property of the returned album objects should not be null.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Response Structure**: According to the Swagger definition, the `images` property is part of the album objects within the `items` array. The definition does not explicitly state that the `images` array must always be present or that it cannot be null. It only describes the structure of the `images` array if it exists.
2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If an album does not have any images, the `images` property could be an empty array (`[]`).
   - If the `images` property is not included in the album object at all, it may be omitted, which would mean it is effectively `null` in the context of the response.
3. **Nullability**: The invariant assumes that `images` will always be present and not null, which is not guaranteed by the Swagger definition. The definition allows for the possibility that the `images` property may not be included in the response for certain albums.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant `return.images != null` does not hold for every valid request on the API (as the `images` property could be omitted or null), the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The API's response structure does not guarantee that `images` will always be present or non-null for every album.

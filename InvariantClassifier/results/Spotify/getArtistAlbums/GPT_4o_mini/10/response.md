### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint that retrieves an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will be an object containing an array called `items`, which holds the album data. Each album in the `items` array contains an `images` array, which is intended to hold objects representing the cover art for the album.

### Invariant
The invariant in question states that the elements of the `images` array must not be null: `return.images[] elements != null`. This means that every image object in the `images` array should be a valid object and not null.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Response Structure**: According to the Swagger definition, the `images` array is part of each album's data. The definition does not explicitly state that the `images` array will always contain valid objects or that it cannot be null. It only describes the properties of the objects within the `images` array.
2. **Potential for Null Values**: The description mentions that the image height and width can be null or not returned. This implies that while the `images` array itself may be present, it is possible that it could contain null values or that the array could be empty. If the `images` array is empty, it would not violate the invariant, but if it contains null elements, the invariant would be violated.
3. **Real-World Scenarios**: In practice, it is common for APIs to return arrays that may contain null values or be empty, especially when there are no images available for a given album. Therefore, the invariant that states all elements in the `images` array must be non-null does not hold true for every valid response.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant `return.images[] elements != null` is a **false-positive**. It does not hold for every valid request on the API, as the `images` array may contain null values or may be empty in certain cases.

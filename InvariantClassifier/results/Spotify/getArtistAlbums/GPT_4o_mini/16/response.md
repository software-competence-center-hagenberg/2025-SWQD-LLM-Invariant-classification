### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `items`, which is an array. Each item in this array can contain properties related to album images.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `return.images[]` is equal to 3, meaning that the response should always contain exactly 3 images.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The response structure indicates that `items` is an array, but it does not specify that this array will always contain exactly 3 elements. The description states that it contains the requested data, which implies variability depending on the artist and their albums.
2. **Variability of Data**: In real-world scenarios, the number of images returned for an album can vary. Some albums may have no images, while others may have multiple images. The API does not enforce a fixed number of images, and thus the invariant that the size of `return.images[]` is always 3 cannot be guaranteed.
3. **Null or Not Returned**: The schema also mentions that if the image height or width is unknown, it may not be returned, which further adds to the variability of the images returned.

### Conclusion
Given the variability in the number of images that can be returned for different albums and the lack of a specification that mandates exactly 3 images, the invariant that `size(return.images[]) == 3` is incorrect. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Artist's Albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                available_markets:
                  type: array
                  description: The markets in which the album is available: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes. Note that an album is considered available in a market when at least 1 of its tracks is available in that market.
                  items:

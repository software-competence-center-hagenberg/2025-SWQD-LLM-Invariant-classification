### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will include an `items` array, where each item contains an `available_markets` array. This `available_markets` array consists of strings representing ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes.

### Invariant
The invariant states that all elements of `return.available_markets[]` have LENGTH=2. This means that every string in the `available_markets` array should be exactly 2 characters long.

### Analysis
According to the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard, country codes are indeed 2-letter codes. Therefore, it is reasonable to assert that all elements in the `available_markets` array must have a length of 2. The invariant aligns with the expected structure of the data returned by the API, as it is based on a well-defined standard (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2).

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant accurately reflects the nature of the data being returned by the API, it can be classified as a true-positive. The invariant holds for every valid request on the API, as all valid country codes in the `available_markets` array must conform to the 2-character length requirement.

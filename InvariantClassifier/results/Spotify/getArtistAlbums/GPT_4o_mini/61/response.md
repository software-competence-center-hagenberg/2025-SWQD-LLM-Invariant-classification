### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will be an object containing an array of items, where each item has an 'artists' array. Each artist object in this array is expected to have a 'type' and a 'uri'.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.type` is a substring of `return.uri`. This means that for every artist returned in the response, the string value of the 'type' field must be found within the string value of the 'uri' field.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Fields**: 
   - `return.type`: This refers to the 'type' field of an artist, which is expected to be a string indicating the object type (e.g., 'artist').
   - `return.uri`: This refers to the 'uri' field of an artist, which is a string representing the Spotify URI for that artist.

2. **Evaluating the Invariant**: 
   - The 'type' field is expected to have a fixed value of 'artist'.
   - The 'uri' field is a Spotify URI that typically follows a specific format, such as `spotify:artist:{artist_id}`.
   - In this case, the invariant would imply that the string 'artist' must be a substring of the URI. However, the URI format does not guarantee that 'artist' will appear as a substring in all cases. For example, a URI could be `spotify:album:{album_id}` or any other format that does not include 'artist'.

3. **Conclusion**: The invariant does not hold for every valid response because the URI may not always contain the string 'artist'. Therefore, the invariant is not universally applicable to all responses from this endpoint.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive** because it does not hold true for every valid request on the API.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will be an object containing an 'items' array, which in turn contains an 'artists' array. Each artist in this array has an 'external_urls' object.

### Invariant
The invariant states that 'return.external_urls != null', which implies that the 'external_urls' object for each artist in the response should not be null.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: According to the Swagger definition, the 'external_urls' field is part of the 'artists' array within the 'items' array of the response. 
2. **Nullability**: The invariant asserts that 'external_urls' cannot be null. However, the Swagger definition does not explicitly state that 'external_urls' must always be present for every artist. It is possible that some artists may not have any external URLs, which would mean that 'external_urls' could be null for those artists.
3. **General API Behavior**: In many APIs, especially those dealing with external links or resources, it is common for certain fields to be optional. If an artist does not have any external URLs, the API could return 'external_urls' as null or omit it entirely from the response.

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition does not guarantee that 'external_urls' will always be present and non-null for every artist, the invariant 'return.external_urls != null' does not hold true for every valid request on the API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a false-positive.

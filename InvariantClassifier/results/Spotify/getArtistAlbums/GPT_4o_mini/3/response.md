### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition outlines a REST API endpoint that retrieves an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an `items` array, where each item has an `images` array. Each image object within the `images` array has a `height` property, which is an integer representing the height of the image in pixels. The definition also notes that if the height is unknown, it may be represented as null or not returned.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `return.height` (which refers to the height of the images) will only take on the values { 64, 300, 640 }. This is a specific constraint on the possible values of the height property.

### Analysis
1. **Possible Values**: The invariant restricts the height to only three specific values. However, the Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the height values returned. It only states that the height is an integer and may be null or not returned if unknown.
2. **Lack of Constraints**: Since the Swagger definition does not impose any restrictions on the values of the height property, it is possible for the height to be any integer, not just the specified values of 64, 300, or 640. For example, heights like 128, 256, or 1024 could also be valid responses, depending on the albums' cover art.
3. **Null or Missing Values**: Additionally, the definition mentions that the height could be null or not returned, which further complicates the invariant's validity. If the height is null or missing, it would not satisfy the invariant.

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition does not limit the height values to only { 64, 300, 640 } and allows for other integers, null, or missing values, the invariant is incorrect. Thus, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

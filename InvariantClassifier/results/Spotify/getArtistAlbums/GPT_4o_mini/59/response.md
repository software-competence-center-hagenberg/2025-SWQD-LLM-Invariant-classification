### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with two properties: `href` and `items`. The `href` is a string that provides a link to the Web API endpoint, while `items` is an array containing data about the albums.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.type` is a substring of `return.href`. Here, `return.type` refers to the type of the objects in the `items.artists` array, which is defined as a string type. The `return.href` is a string that provides a link to the Web API endpoint.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the type of the artist (which is a string) should be a substring of the `href` string. However, the `href` is a URL that typically does not contain the type of the object being referenced. 
2. **Context of the Response**: The `href` is meant to provide a link to the API endpoint and does not inherently relate to the type of the objects in the response. 
3. **Practical Example**: For instance, if `return.type` is 'artist', the `href` might look something like 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/123/albums', which does not contain 'artist' as a substring. This indicates that the invariant does not hold true for all valid responses.

### Conclusion
Given the nature of the `href` and the `type`, the invariant that `return.type` is a substring of `return.href` is not universally valid. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

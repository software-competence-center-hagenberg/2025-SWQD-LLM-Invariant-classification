### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums. The endpoint accepts a query parameter `limit`, which specifies the maximum number of items to return. The response contains an array of items representing the albums, and the number of items returned can be influenced by the `limit` parameter.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter `limit` must be greater than or equal to the size of the returned items array: `input.limit >= size(return.items[])`. This means that the number of items returned in the response should never exceed the value of the `limit` parameter provided in the request.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the `limit` Parameter**: The `limit` parameter is defined with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum length of 50. This means that if a user sets `limit` to a value, the API should return up to that many items, but it could return fewer if there are not enough albums available for the artist.
2. **Behavior of the API**: The invariant suggests that the API will always return a number of items that is less than or equal to the `limit`. This is generally expected behavior for APIs that implement pagination or item limiting. However, if the API has no albums for the artist, it would return an empty array, which would still satisfy the invariant since `0 >= 0`.
3. **Potential Edge Cases**: The only scenario where the invariant could potentially be violated is if the API does not respect the `limit` parameter and returns more items than specified. However, based on standard API design practices, it is expected that the number of items returned should not exceed the limit specified in the request.

### Conclusion
Given the standard behavior of REST APIs and the specific definition of the `limit` parameter in the Swagger documentation, the invariant `input.limit >= size(return.items[])` holds true for every valid request on this API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

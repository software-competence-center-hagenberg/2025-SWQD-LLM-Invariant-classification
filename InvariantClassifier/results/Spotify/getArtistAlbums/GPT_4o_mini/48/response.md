### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums. The response schema includes two properties: `limit` and `offset`, both of which are integers. 

- `limit`: Represents the maximum number of items in the response.
- `offset`: Represents the offset of the items returned.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.limit >= return.offset`. This means that the value of `limit` in the response should always be greater than or equal to the value of `offset`.

### Analysis
To evaluate the invariant, we need to consider the meanings of `limit` and `offset`:
- `limit` indicates how many items can be returned in the response.
- `offset` indicates how many items to skip before starting to return items.

In a typical pagination scenario, it is possible for `offset` to be greater than `limit`. For example, if `limit` is set to 10 (indicating that up to 10 items can be returned), and `offset` is set to 15 (indicating that the first 15 items should be skipped), the invariant `return.limit >= return.offset` would not hold true, as 10 is not greater than or equal to 15.

### Conclusion
Since there are valid scenarios where `offset` can exceed `limit`, the invariant `return.limit >= return.offset` does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will be an object containing an array of items, where each item represents an album. Each album item has a property called `external_urls`, which is an object containing known external URLs for the album.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.external_urls != null`, which implies that the `external_urls` property of the album items in the response should never be null.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The response schema indicates that `external_urls` is a property of each item in the `items` array. However, the schema does not specify that `external_urls` is a required field or that it must always be present. 
2. **Possible Scenarios**: It is possible for an album to not have any external URLs, which means that the `external_urls` property could be absent or explicitly set to null. The API documentation does not guarantee that every album will have external URLs, so there could be cases where `external_urls` is indeed null.
3. **Conclusion**: Since the invariant assumes that `external_urls` will always be non-null without any explicit requirement in the schema to support this, the invariant does not hold for every valid request. 

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.external_urls != null` is a false-positive because the response does not guarantee that `external_urls` will always be present or non-null for every album item in the response.

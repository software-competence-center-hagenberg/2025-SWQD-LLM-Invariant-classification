### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `items`, which is an array. Each item in this array contains a property `images`, which is also an array. The description states that this `images` array contains cover art for the album in various sizes.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `return.images[]` array must be one of { 1, 3 }. This means that for every valid response from this endpoint, the `images` array must either contain exactly 1 or exactly 3 elements.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests a strict limitation on the number of images that can be returned for each album. However, the Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the number of images that can be included in the `images` array. It only states that the `images` array can contain cover art in various sizes. This implies that the number of images could potentially vary widely, depending on the album and its associated cover art. Therefore, it is entirely possible for the `images` array to contain 0, 2, 4, or more images, which would violate the invariant.

### Conclusion
Since the Swagger definition does not impose any restrictions on the number of images that can be returned, the invariant that the size of `return.images[]` must be one of { 1, 3 } is incorrect. Thus, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/artists/{id}/albums`. The response for this request is expected to be an object containing a property `items`, which is an array of objects. Each object in this array has a property `type`, which is described as a string that indicates the object type, specifically stating that it should be 'album'.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.type == "album"`. This implies that for every item in the `items` array of the response, the `type` property must equal 'album'.

### Analysis
Given the Swagger definition, the `items` array is explicitly described to contain objects where the `type` is defined as a string that should be 'album'. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that every object in the `items` array must have a `type` property that equals 'album'. 

However, the invariant is phrased in a way that suggests it is checking a single `return.type`, which could imply that it is checking a singular value rather than the values of each item in the `items` array. If interpreted as checking the `type` of a single return object rather than each object in the array, it could lead to confusion. The invariant should ideally specify that it applies to each item in the `items` array.

### Conclusion
The invariant correctly reflects the expected behavior of the API response as per the Swagger definition, as all items in the `items` array are indeed expected to have a `type` of 'album'. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive** because it holds for every valid request on the API.

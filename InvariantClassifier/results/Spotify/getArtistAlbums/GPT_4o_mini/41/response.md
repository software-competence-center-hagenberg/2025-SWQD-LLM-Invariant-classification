### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will be an object containing a property `total`, which is of type integer. The description states that `total` represents the total number of items available to return.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.total >= 0`, which means that the total number of albums returned should be greater than or equal to zero.

### Analysis
In the context of the API, the `total` field is expected to represent the count of albums associated with a specific artist. Since it is a count of items, it logically cannot be negative. The API should return a non-negative integer for the `total` field, as it reflects the number of albums available. Therefore, the invariant `return.total >= 0` is consistent with the expected behavior of the API.

### Conclusion
Given that the `total` field is defined as an integer representing a count of items, and counts cannot be negative, the invariant `return.total >= 0` is correct and holds for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `items`, which is an array of album objects. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.items != null`, which implies that the `items` array in the response should not be null. 

### Analysis
In the context of the API, the `items` property is expected to be an array. According to the Swagger definition, while the `items` array can be empty (i.e., it can contain zero elements), it should not be null. The API is designed to return an empty array when there are no albums available for the specified artist, rather than returning a null value. Therefore, the invariant `return.items != null` is expected to hold true for all valid requests to this endpoint. 

### Conclusion
Given that the API is designed to return an empty array instead of a null value for the `items` property, the invariant is correct and holds for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an artist's albums. The response schema indicates that the response will include an `href` field (a string) and an `items` field (an array of objects). Each object in the `items` array has a `type` field, which is also a string that indicates the type of the object, specifically that it is an 'album'.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.type` is a substring of `return.href`. Here, `return.type` refers to the `type` field of the items in the response, and `return.href` refers to the `href` field in the response object.

### Analysis
To evaluate the invariant, we need to consider the possible values of `return.type` and `return.href`. The `return.type` is specified to be 'album', which is a fixed string. The `return.href` is a URL string that points to the Web API endpoint returning the full result of the request. 

For the invariant to hold true, the string 'album' must be a substring of the `href`. However, there is no requirement or guarantee in the Swagger definition that the `href` will contain the substring 'album'. The `href` could be a generic URL that does not include the word 'album' at all. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid response.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not hold true for all valid responses from the API, it is classified as a false-positive. The relationship between `return.type` and `return.href` is not guaranteed by the API definition, making the invariant incorrect.

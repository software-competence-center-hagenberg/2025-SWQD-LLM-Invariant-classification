### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks`, which returns a response containing an object with a property `items`. The `items` property is an array that contains objects representing tracks, and each track object has an `external_urls` property, which is also an object.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.external_urls != null`, indicating that the `external_urls` property of the returned track objects should never be null.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Response Structure**: The response structure indicates that `items` is an array of track objects. Each track object is expected to have an `external_urls` property.
2. **Nullability of `external_urls`**: The Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `external_urls` is required or that it cannot be null. Therefore, it is possible that some track objects in the `items` array may have `external_urls` set to null, especially if certain tracks do not have associated external URLs.
3. **Real-world API Behavior**: In practice, APIs often return null for optional fields when data is not available. Since the definition does not enforce that `external_urls` must always be present, the invariant `return.external_urls != null` may not hold true for every valid response.

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition does not guarantee that `external_urls` will always be present and non-null for every track object in the response, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. It is not correct to assume that `external_urls` will always be non-null for every valid request to this API endpoint.

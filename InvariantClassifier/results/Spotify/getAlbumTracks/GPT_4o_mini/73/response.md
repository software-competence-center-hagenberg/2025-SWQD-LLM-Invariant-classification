### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving tracks from an album. The response includes an object with properties `href` and `items`, where `items` is an array containing objects that may have a `linked_from` property. The `linked_from` property itself contains an `id` and a `href`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.linked_from.id` is a substring of `return.linked_from.href`. This means that the ID of the track should be found within the URL that links to the track.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Relationship**: The `id` is the Spotify ID for the track, while `href` is a link to the Web API endpoint for that track. The format of the `href` typically includes the track ID as part of the URL, but this is not guaranteed by the API specification. 
2. **Possible Scenarios**: There could be cases where the `href` does not contain the `id` as a substring. For example, if the `href` is a generic endpoint that does not include the specific track ID or if the API changes its URL structure in the future.
3. **API Flexibility**: APIs can evolve, and while it is common for an ID to be part of a URL, it is not a strict requirement. Therefore, the invariant cannot be assumed to hold in all cases.

### Conclusion
Given the potential for the `href` not to include the `id` as a substring, the invariant is not guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API. Thus, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

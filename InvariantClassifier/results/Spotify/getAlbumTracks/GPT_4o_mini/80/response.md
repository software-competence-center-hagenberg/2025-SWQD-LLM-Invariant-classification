### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks`, which returns a response containing an array of track objects. Each track object is expected to have a `type` and a `uri`. The `type` is specified to be a string that indicates the object type, which is 'track'. The `uri` is also a string that represents the Spotify URI for the track.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.type` is a substring of `return.uri`. This means that the value of the `type` field in the response should be found within the value of the `uri` field.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Fields**: The `type` field is always 'track' for the items returned from this endpoint, as per the description. The `uri` field, on the other hand, is a Spotify URI that typically looks like `spotify:track:<track_id>`. 
2. **Substring Relationship**: For the invariant to hold true, the string 'track' must be a substring of the `uri`. However, examining a typical Spotify URI, we find that it does not contain the substring 'track'. For example, a URI like `spotify:track:123456` does not have 'track' as a substring; it has 'track' as a prefix, but that does not satisfy the substring condition as defined by the invariant.
3. **General Case**: Since the `uri` format is consistent across all tracks, and since 'track' is not a substring of the `uri`, the invariant will not hold true for any valid response from this endpoint.

### Conclusion
The invariant that `return.type` is a substring of `return.uri` is incorrect based on the structure of the data returned by the API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

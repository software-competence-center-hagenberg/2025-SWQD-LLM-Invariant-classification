### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving tracks of a specific album. The response schema indicates that the response will be an object containing an array of items, where each item represents a track and includes an array of artists. Each artist object contains an `external_urls` field, which is an object that holds known external URLs for that artist.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.external_urls != null`, meaning that the `external_urls` field for each artist in the response should not be null.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Response Structure**: The response structure indicates that each artist object includes an `external_urls` field. However, the Swagger definition does not specify that this field is required or that it must always contain a value. 
2. **Possibility of Null Values**: Since the definition does not enforce that `external_urls` must always be present or non-null, it is possible for some artist objects to have `external_urls` set to null. This could happen if the artist does not have any known external URLs.
3. **Real-World Scenarios**: In practice, APIs often return partial data, and it is common for certain fields to be absent or null, especially in cases where the data is not applicable or available for specific entries.

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition does not guarantee that `external_urls` will always be non-null for every artist, the invariant `return.external_urls != null` cannot be considered universally true for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

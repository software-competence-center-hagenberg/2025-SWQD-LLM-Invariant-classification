### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving tracks from an album. The response schema indicates that the response will be an object containing an array of items, where each item has a property called `disc_number`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.disc_number >= 1`, which implies that the `disc_number` for each track in the response should always be greater than or equal to 1.

### Analysis
According to the Swagger definition, the `disc_number` is defined as an integer. The description mentions that it is usually 1 unless the album consists of more than one disc. This suggests that while `disc_number` can be 1, it does not explicitly rule out the possibility of it being 0 or negative in cases where the album might not be structured in a standard way or if there are errors in the data.

Since the invariant states that `disc_number` must be greater than or equal to 1, it assumes that there will never be a case where `disc_number` could be 0 or negative. However, the description does not guarantee this, and there could be edge cases or errors in the data that could lead to a `disc_number` of 0 or less.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes a condition that is not explicitly guaranteed by the Swagger definition, it is possible for the invariant to be violated. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

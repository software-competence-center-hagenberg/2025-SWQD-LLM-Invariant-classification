### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to the endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks`, which returns a response containing an object with a property `items`. The `items` property is an array of objects, each of which includes a boolean property `is_local` that indicates whether the track is local.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.is_local == false`, which implies that every track in the response will have the `is_local` property set to `false`.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that all tracks returned from the API will be non-local. However, the Swagger definition does not impose any restrictions on the values of `is_local`. It is possible for the API to return a mix of local and non-local tracks, depending on the album and its contents. Therefore, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold true for every valid request to the API, as there could be cases where `is_local` is `true` for some tracks.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant `return.is_local == false` does not hold for every valid response from the API, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving tracks from a specific album. The request can include a query parameter `limit`, which specifies the maximum number of items to return, with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 50. The response includes an array of track objects, each containing a `duration_ms` field that indicates the length of the track in milliseconds.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.limit < return.duration_ms`, meaning that the value of the `limit` parameter in the request should always be less than the duration of any track returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Parameters and Response**: The `limit` parameter controls how many tracks are returned in the response, but it does not impose any restrictions on the duration of the tracks themselves. The `duration_ms` of a track can vary widely and is not directly related to the `limit` parameter.
2. **Possible Values**: The `limit` can be set to any integer between 0 and 50. However, the `duration_ms` can be any non-negative integer, including values that are less than or equal to 50 (e.g., a track could be 30 milliseconds long). Therefore, it is entirely possible for `input.limit` to be greater than or equal to `return.duration_ms` for some tracks.
3. **Counterexample**: If a request is made with `limit = 30` and a track with `duration_ms = 20` is returned, the invariant `input.limit < return.duration_ms` would not hold, as 30 is not less than 20.

### Conclusion
The invariant `input.limit < return.duration_ms` does not hold for every valid request on the API, as there are scenarios where the limit can be greater than or equal to the duration of a track returned in the response. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

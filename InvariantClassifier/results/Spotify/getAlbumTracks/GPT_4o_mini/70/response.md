### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving tracks from an album. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with properties `href` and `items`. The `items` property is an array of objects, each of which may contain a `linked_from` object with a `type` property.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.linked_from.type` is a substring of `return.href`. This means that for every track returned in the response, the `type` of the `linked_from` object should be found within the `href` string.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**: The `href` property is a string that provides a link to the Web API endpoint for the full result of the request. The `linked_from.type` property is a string that indicates the type of the object, which in this case is expected to be 'track'.
2. **Relationship Between Properties**: There is no inherent relationship defined in the Swagger specification that guarantees that the `type` of the `linked_from` object will be a substring of the `href`. The `href` is a URL, while `type` is a descriptor of the object. For example, if `href` is "https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/123/tracks" and `type` is "track", then `type` is not a substring of `href`. 
3. **General Cases**: The invariant would only hold true if the API was designed such that the `type` string is always included in the `href`, which is not a standard or guaranteed behavior based on the provided definition. 

### Conclusion
Given that there is no requirement or guarantee in the API specification that `return.linked_from.type` will always be a substring of `return.href`, this invariant is not universally valid. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

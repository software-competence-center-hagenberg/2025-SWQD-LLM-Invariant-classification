### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving tracks from a specific album. The response schema indicates that the `available_markets` property is an array of strings, where each string represents a country code in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format.

### Invariant
The invariant states that all elements of `return.available_markets[]` have LENGTH=2, which means that every string in the `available_markets` array must be exactly 2 characters long.

### Analysis
The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are indeed 2-letter country codes (e.g., 'US' for the United States, 'GB' for Great Britain). Therefore, according to the definition of these codes, every element in the `available_markets` array should have a length of 2. This aligns with the invariant's claim.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant correctly reflects the expected structure of the `available_markets` array as defined by the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard, it holds true for every valid request to the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive**.

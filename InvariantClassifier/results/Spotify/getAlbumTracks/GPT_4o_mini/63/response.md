### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve tracks from a specific album. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an array of items, each of which may include a `linked_from` object. This object contains a property `uri`, which is a string representing the Spotify URI for the track.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of the `uri` string in the `linked_from` object is always 36 characters: `LENGTH(return.linked_from.uri)==36`. This is classified as a fixed-length string invariant.

### Analysis
In the context of Spotify URIs, the format typically follows a specific structure, such as `spotify:track:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`, where the last part (the identifier) is usually 22 characters long. However, the total length of the URI string can vary based on the prefix and the type of resource being referenced (track, album, artist, etc.). For example, a track URI might look like `spotify:track:6rqhFgbbKwnmWQx8nA0t60`, which is longer than 36 characters. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that every `linked_from.uri` will have a length of exactly 36 characters.

### Conclusion
Given that the length of the `uri` string can vary and is not fixed at 36 characters, the invariant `LENGTH(return.linked_from.uri)==36` does not hold for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve tracks from a specific album. The response includes an object with properties such as `href` and `items`. The `items` property is an array of track objects, each containing an `artists` array. Each artist object has a `type` property, which indicates the type of the object (in this case, 'artist').

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.type` is a substring of `return.href`. This means that for every artist object in the response, the value of the `type` property should be found within the `href` property of the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Fields**: The `return.type` refers to the `type` property of the artist object, which is a string that indicates the object type (e.g., 'artist'). The `return.href` refers to the `href` property of the response object, which is a string containing a link to the Web API endpoint.
2. **Evaluating the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the string 'artist' (or whatever the value of `return.type` is) must be a substring of the `href`. However, the `href` is a URL that typically does not contain the type of the object as part of its structure. For example, a typical `href` might look like `https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/{id}` or similar, which does not guarantee that 'artist' will be a substring of the URL.
3. **General Case**: Since the `href` is a URL and the `type` is a descriptor of the object, there is no inherent relationship that guarantees `return.type` will always be a substring of `return.href`. This means that while it may hold true for some specific cases, it cannot be generalized for all valid responses.

### Conclusion
The invariant that `return.type` is a substring of `return.href` does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

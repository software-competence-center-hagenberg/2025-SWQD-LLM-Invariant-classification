## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/albums/{id}/tracks' has a GET method with a 'limit' query parameter.
- The response schema includes an array of 'items', each with a 'duration_ms' field.

## Invariant
The invariant is input.limit < return.duration_ms, which means that the 'limit' parameter in the request should be less than the 'duration_ms' of each track in the response.

## Analysis
The invariant assumes that the 'duration_ms' field is present in the response and that the 'limit' parameter is used to limit the number of tracks returned. However, the Swagger definition does not guarantee that 'duration_ms' will always be present in the response, and the 'limit' parameter is not explicitly tied to the number of tracks returned. Additionally, the 'maxLength' constraint on the 'limit' parameter is 50, which may not correspond to the number of tracks returned.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it makes assumptions about the response structure and the behavior of the 'limit' parameter that are not guaranteed by the Swagger definition.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition contains a GET endpoint for retrieving an album's tracks.
- The response schema includes a property 'href' of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.linked_from.href is Url' checks if the 'href' field in the response body is a URL.

## Analysis
Based on the provided swagger definition, the 'href' field in the response body is defined as a string type. This means that it can potentially contain any string and not necessarily a URL. Therefore, the invariant 'return.linked_from.href is Url' is a false-positive.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

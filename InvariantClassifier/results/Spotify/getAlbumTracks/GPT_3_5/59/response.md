## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provided does not include the complete definition for the GET request on the path "/albums/{id}/tracks". It is missing the details of the request parameters and the structure of the response.

## Invariant
- The invariant LENGTH(return.linked_from.href)==56 specifies that the length of the "href" field in the response body must always be 56 characters.

## Analysis
- Since the swagger definition does not provide the complete structure of the response, it is not possible to determine if the length of the "href" field will always be 56 characters. Without the complete response schema, it is not possible to verify the fixed length of the "href" field.

## Conclusion
- The invariant is a false-positive as it cannot be verified without the complete response schema.

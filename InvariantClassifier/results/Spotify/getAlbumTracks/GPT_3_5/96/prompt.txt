Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/albums/{id}/tracks"
  get:
    description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
    parameters:
      - name: limit
        in: query
        description: The maximum number of items to return
        type: integer
        minimum: 0
        maxLength: 50
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                available_markets:
                  type: array
                  description: A list of the countries in which the track can be played, identified by their ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code.
                  items:
                    type: string


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: input.limit != size(return.available_markets[])-1

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntNonEqual
Invariant description: Represents an invariant of != between two long scalars. Prints as x != y.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

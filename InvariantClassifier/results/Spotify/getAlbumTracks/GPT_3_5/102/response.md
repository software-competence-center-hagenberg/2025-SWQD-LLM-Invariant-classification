## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The swagger definition excerpt provided describes a GET request to retrieve an album's tracks. The response schema includes a property 'limit' which represents the maximum number of items in the response.

## Invariant
The invariant 'return.limit >= 1' specifies that the 'limit' field in the response must be greater than or equal to 1.

## Analysis
Given the information provided in the swagger definition, the invariant 'return.limit >= 1' is a true-positive. The response 'limit' should indeed be greater than or equal to 1, as it represents the maximum number of items in the response. This ensures that the API always returns at least one item in the response, which is consistent with the expected behavior of retrieving tracks for an album.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive

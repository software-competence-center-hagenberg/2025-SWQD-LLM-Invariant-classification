The invariant input.limit != return.total is a false-positive for this REST endpoint. The reason is that the 'limit' parameter in the request specifies the maximum number of items to return, while the 'total' field in the response specifies the total number of items available to return. These two values are not expected to be equal in general, as the total number of items available may exceed the limit specified in the request. Therefore, this invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition contains a GET endpoint for retrieving an album's tracks.
- The response schema includes a property 'next' of type string, which is described as a URL to the next page of items.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that 'return.next' is a URL.

## Analysis
- The response schema specifies that the 'next' property is of type string and is described as a URL.
- However, the invariant does not account for the possibility of the 'next' property being null, as indicated in the schema description.

## Conclusion
- The invariant is a false-positive because it does not consider the possibility of the 'next' property being null, which would violate the invariant. Therefore, it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

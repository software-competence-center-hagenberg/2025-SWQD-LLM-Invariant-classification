## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint `/albums/{id}/tracks` has a GET method with a query parameter `market`.
- The response schema includes a property `next` of type string, which represents the URL to the next page of items.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the value of the `market` parameter in the request should be a substring of the value of the `next` property in the response.

## Analysis
- The invariant is true-positive if, for every valid request to the endpoint, the value of the `market` parameter is always a substring of the value of the `next` property in the response.
- However, the Swagger definition does not provide any constraints or guarantees about the relationship between the `market` parameter and the `next` property. Therefore, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive because it cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition contains a GET endpoint for retrieving an album's tracks. The response schema includes a property 'items' which contains an array of track objects. Each track object may have a 'linked_from' property, which contains information about the originally requested track.

## Invariant
The invariant states that 'return.linked_from.type' is a substring of 'return.href'. This means that the 'type' field within the 'linked_from' object should be a substring of the 'href' field in the response.

## Analysis
Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'linked_from' object is part of the response when track relinking is applied, and it contains information about the originally requested track. The 'href' field is a link to the Web API endpoint returning the full result of the request. It is not explicitly stated that 'return.linked_from.type' should be a substring of 'return.href' in the API documentation.

## Conclusion
The invariant 'return.linked_from.type' is a substring of 'return.href' is a false-positive. It is not a guaranteed property of the API based on the provided Swagger definition.

The invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant assumes a specific relationship between the request parameter 'offset' and the size of the 'available_markets' array in the response. However, the Swagger definition does not provide any guarantee that the 'offset' parameter and the size of the 'available_markets' array are related in the specified way. Therefore, the invariant cannot be considered true-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

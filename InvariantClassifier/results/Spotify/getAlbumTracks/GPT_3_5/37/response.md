## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/albums/{id}/tracks' is a GET request to retrieve an album's tracks.
- The response schema includes a 'total' field of type integer, representing the total number of items available to return.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.total >= 1', which specifies that the total number of items available to return should be greater than or equal to 1.

## Analysis
- The invariant 'return.total >= 1' is true-positive for this REST endpoint. This is because for a valid request to retrieve an album's tracks, there should be at least 1 track available in the response. Therefore, the invariant holds true for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: true-positive

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve an album's tracks from the Spotify Web API. The response schema includes a 'limit' field and an 'items' array.

### Invariant
The invariant states that 'return.limit' (the maximum number of items in the response) should be greater than or equal to the size of 'return.items[]' (the number of items in the response).

### Analysis
The invariant is true-positive. This is because the 'limit' field in the response schema is intended to represent the maximum number of items in the response. Therefore, it should always be greater than or equal to the actual number of items in the 'items' array.

### Conclusion
The invariant is true-positive and holds for every valid request on the API.

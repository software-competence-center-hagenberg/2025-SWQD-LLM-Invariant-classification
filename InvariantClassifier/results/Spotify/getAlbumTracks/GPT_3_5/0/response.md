## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided excerpt of the Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve an album's tracks from the Spotify Web API. The response schema includes a property 'items' which contains an array of tracks, and each track object contains a property 'artists' which is an array of artists. Each artist object includes a property 'external_urls' which represents known external URLs for the artist.

## Invariant

The invariant 'return.external_urls != null' checks if the 'external_urls' property for each artist in the response is not null.

## Analysis

Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'external_urls' property is described as known external URLs for the artist, and it is reasonable to assume that this property should not be null for valid responses. Therefore, the invariant 'return.external_urls != null' is likely to hold true for valid requests on the API.

## Conclusion

Verdict: true-positive

The invariant 'return.external_urls != null' is classified as true-positive because it is likely to hold for valid requests on the API, based on the provided Swagger definition and the nature of the 'external_urls' property.

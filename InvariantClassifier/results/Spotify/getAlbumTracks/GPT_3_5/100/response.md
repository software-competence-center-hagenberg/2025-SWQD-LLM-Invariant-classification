## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/albums/{id}/tracks' is a GET request to retrieve an album's tracks.
- The response schema includes an array of 'artists' and an array of 'available_markets'.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the size of the 'artists' array in the response should not be equal to the size of the 'available_markets' array.

## Analysis
- The provided swagger definition does not explicitly specify the exact structure of the response, so we cannot determine if the invariant holds for every valid request.
- Without knowing the exact structure of the response, we cannot guarantee that the size of 'artists' and 'available_markets' arrays will always be different.

## Conclusion
- The invariant is a false-positive because it cannot be verified based on the provided swagger definition.

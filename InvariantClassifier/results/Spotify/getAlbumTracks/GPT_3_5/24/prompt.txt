Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/albums/{id}/tracks"
  get:
    description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: [Get an Album's Tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-albums-tracks/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            items:
              type: array
              description: The requested data.
              items:
                available_markets:
                  type: array
                  description: A list of the countries in which the track can be played, identified by their ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code.
                  items:
                    type: string
              items:
                linked_from:
                  type: object
                  description: Part of the response when Track Relinking is applied, and the requested track has been replaced with different track. The track in the linked_from object contains information about the originally requested track.
                  properties:
                    uri:
                      type: string
                      description: The Spotify URI for the track.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.linked_from.uri in return.available_markets[]

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.sequenceString.MemberString
Invariant description: Represents String scalars that are always members of a sequence of String values. Prints as x in y[] where x is a String scalar and y[] is a sequence of String.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.
The return fields refer to the path "items" in the response body.

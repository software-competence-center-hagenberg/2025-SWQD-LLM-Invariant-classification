## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/albums/{id}/tracks' is a GET request to retrieve an album's tracks.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing 'available_markets' and 'linked_from' properties.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.linked_from.uri in return.available_markets[]' checks if the 'uri' in 'linked_from' is present in the 'available_markets' array.

## Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive because the 'linked_from.uri' and 'available_markets' are not directly related in the response schema. The 'linked_from' object and 'available_markets' array are separate properties within the 'items' array and do not have a direct relationship as implied by the invariant.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API as the 'linked_from.uri' is not in the 'available_markets' array as per the response schema.

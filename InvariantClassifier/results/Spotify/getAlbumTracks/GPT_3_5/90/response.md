The invariant input.limit != size(return.artists[]) is false-positive. The reason is that the 'artists' field is nested within the 'items' field in the response body. Therefore, the 'size(return.artists[])' does not directly correspond to the 'limit' parameter in the request. The 'limit' parameter controls the maximum number of items to return, but it does not directly relate to the number of artists returned for each item. As a result, this invariant is not valid for every valid request on the API.

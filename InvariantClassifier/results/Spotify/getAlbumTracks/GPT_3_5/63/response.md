## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/albums/{id}/tracks' is a GET request to retrieve an album's tracks.
- The response schema includes a field 'linked_from' which contains information about the originally requested track.
- The 'uri' field within 'linked_from' is described as a string.

## Invariant
- The invariant is LENGTH(return.linked_from.uri)==36, which specifies that the length of the 'uri' field within 'linked_from' should always be 36 characters.

## Analysis
- The invariant is a fixed-length string constraint, which means it expects the 'uri' field to always have a fixed length of 36 characters.
- However, there is no indication in the Swagger definition that the 'uri' field is guaranteed to have a fixed length of 36 characters.
- The length of the 'uri' field may vary based on the Spotify API's implementation and the data it represents.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive as it assumes a fixed length for the 'uri' field without any evidence or guarantee from the API definition.

Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/albums/{id}/tracks' has a GET method that returns a list of tracks for a given album.
- The response schema includes an array of items, each containing a 'disc_number' field.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.disc_number >= 1' specifies that the 'disc_number' in the response must be greater than or equal to 1.

Analysis:
- The Swagger definition does not provide any constraints or documentation regarding the minimum value of 'disc_number'.
- It is possible that 'disc_number' can be 0 or negative, which would violate the invariant.

Conclusion:
- The invariant 'return.disc_number >= 1' is a false-positive because it does not hold for every valid response on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/albums/{id}/tracks' is a GET request to retrieve an album's tracks.
- The response schema includes an array of track items, each containing 'duration_ms' (track length in milliseconds) and 'available_markets' (a list of countries where the track can be played).

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.duration_ms > size(return.available_markets[])' checks if the track length in milliseconds is greater than the number of available markets for the track.

## Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive because the comparison 'return.duration_ms > size(return.available_markets[])' does not hold for every valid request on the API. It assumes a direct relationship between track length and the number of available markets, which may not be true in all cases. For example, a short track could be available in many markets, while a long track could be available in fewer markets.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The Swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve an album's tracks.
- The response schema includes a field 'items' which contains an array of track objects, each with an 'external_urls' field.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.external_urls != null', which checks if the 'external_urls' field in the response is not null.

## Analysis
- The invariant is true-positive because the response schema guarantees that the 'external_urls' field exists within the 'items' array, and it will not be null.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: true-positive
- The invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

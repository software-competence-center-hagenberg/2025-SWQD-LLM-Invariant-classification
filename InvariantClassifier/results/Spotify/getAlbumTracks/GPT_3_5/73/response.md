## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/albums/{id}/tracks' has a GET operation defined.
- The response schema includes a property 'items' which is an array of objects.
- Each object in the 'items' array contains a property 'linked_from' which is an object with a property 'id' of type string and a property 'href' of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant states that 'return.linked_from.id' is a substring of 'return.linked_from.href'.

## Analysis
The invariant is false-positive. The reason is that the 'linked_from' object is part of the response when Track Relinking is applied, and it contains information about the originally requested track. The 'id' and 'href' properties in the 'linked_from' object are not related in a way that 'id' would be a substring of 'href'. Therefore, this invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive

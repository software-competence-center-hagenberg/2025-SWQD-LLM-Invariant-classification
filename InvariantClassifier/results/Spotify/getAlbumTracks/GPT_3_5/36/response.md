## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve an album's tracks.
- The response schema includes a field 'offset' of type integer with the description 'The offset of the items returned'.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.offset >= 0', which specifies that the 'offset' field in the response must be greater than or equal to 0.

## Analysis
- The invariant 'return.offset >= 0' is a true-positive for this REST endpoint.
- Since the 'offset' field represents the offset of the items returned, it should always be a non-negative integer.
- This invariant ensures that the API response adheres to the expected behavior of the 'offset' field.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: true-positive

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving an album's tracks from the Spotify API.
- The response schema includes a field 'is_local' of type boolean.

## Invariant
- The invariant is 'return.is_local == false', which means that the 'is_local' field in the response must always be false.

## Analysis
- The invariant is a unary scalar invariant that checks if the 'is_local' field in the response is always false.
- Since the response schema does not specify any constraints on the 'is_local' field, it is possible for the field to have a value of true in some valid responses.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant 'return.is_local == false' is a false-positive because the response schema does not enforce the 'is_local' field to always be false. Therefore, this invariant will not hold for every valid request on the API.

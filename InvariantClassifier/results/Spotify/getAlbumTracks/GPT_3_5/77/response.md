## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/albums/{id}/tracks' has a GET operation that returns a list of tracks for a given album.
- The response schema includes a field 'linked_from' with subfields 'type' and 'uri'.

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking if the 'type' field of 'linked_from' is a substring of the 'uri' field.

## Analysis
- The invariant is checking a substring relationship between two string fields in the response body.
- Since the 'type' field is a string, it can be a substring of the 'uri' field, and the invariant is valid.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a true-positive.

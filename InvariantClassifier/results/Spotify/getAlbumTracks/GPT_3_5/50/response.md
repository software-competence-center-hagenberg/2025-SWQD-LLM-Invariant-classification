The invariant LENGTH(return.uri)==37 is a false-positive. This is because the Swagger definition does not guarantee that the 'uri' field in the 'artists' array will always have a fixed length of 37 characters. The length of the 'uri' field is not specified in the Swagger definition, and it is not a standard practice to enforce fixed lengths for URIs in REST APIs. Therefore, this invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET request to retrieve an album's tracks.
- The response schema includes a property 'href' of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.href is Url' specifies that the 'href' field in the response body is always a URL.

## Analysis
- The swagger definition does not explicitly specify that the 'href' field should always be a URL.
- The type of the 'href' field is defined as a string, but there is no constraint or validation that enforces it to be a URL.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant 'return.href is Url' is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API. The swagger definition does not guarantee that the 'href' field will always be a URL.

Swagger Definition Breakdown:
- The endpoint '/users/{user_id}/playlists' has a POST method to create a playlist.
- The response to this POST request includes a 'followers' field in the response body.

Invariant:
- The invariant 'return.followers != null' checks if the 'followers' field in the response body is not null.

Analysis:
- Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'followers' field is present in the response schema, and it is not explicitly marked as optional or nullable.
- Therefore, the invariant 'return.followers != null' is true-positive, as it correctly ensures that the 'followers' field in the response body is not null for every valid request on the API.

Conclusion:
- Verdict: true-positive

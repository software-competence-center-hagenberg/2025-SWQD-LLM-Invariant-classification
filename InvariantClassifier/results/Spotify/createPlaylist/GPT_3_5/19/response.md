The invariant 'return.tracks.items[] == []' checks if the 'items' array in the response body is empty. This invariant is a false-positive because it assumes that the 'items' array will always be empty, which may not be the case for every valid request on the API. The Swagger definition does not enforce that the 'items' array should always be empty, so the invariant does not hold for every valid request.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/users/{user_id}/playlists' supports a POST request to create a playlist.
- The response to this request is expected to have a '201' status code.
- The response body contains 'external_urls' and 'type' properties.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the 'type' property in the response should be a substring of the 'external_urls.spotify' property.

## Analysis
- The response body schema does not include a property named 'return'. Instead, it has 'properties' directly under the 'schema' object.
- The 'type' property in the response is not related to the 'external_urls.spotify' property, and there is no indication in the Swagger definition that they are related in a substring manner.

## Conclusion
Based on the Swagger definition and the structure of the response, the invariant is false-positive.

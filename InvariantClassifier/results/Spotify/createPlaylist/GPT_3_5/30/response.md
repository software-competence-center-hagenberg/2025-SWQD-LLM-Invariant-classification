## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The POST request to "/users/{user_id}/playlists" allows creating a playlist.
- The response to this request includes a field `snapshot_id` of type string.

## Invariant
- The invariant specifies that the length of the `snapshot_id` in the response must always be 56 characters.

## Analysis
- The Swagger definition does not provide any constraints or guarantees about the length of the `snapshot_id` field.
- There is no indication in the definition that the length of `snapshot_id` is fixed at 56 characters.
- The invariant assumes a fixed length constraint that is not specified in the API definition.

## Conclusion
The invariant "LENGTH(return.snapshot_id)==56" is a false-positive. It is incorrect because the API definition does not enforce or guarantee a fixed length of 56 characters for the `snapshot_id` field in the response.

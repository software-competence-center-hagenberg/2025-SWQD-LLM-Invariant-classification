    parameters:
      - name: user_id
        in: path
        description: The user's Spotify user ID.
        required: true
        type: string

        schema:
          type: object
    responses:
      '201':
        description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
        schema:
          type: object

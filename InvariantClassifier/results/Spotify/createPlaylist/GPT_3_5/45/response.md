## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The POST request to "/users/{user_id}/playlists" allows creating a playlist.
- The response to this request includes the properties 'href' and 'type' within an object.

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking if the 'type' property is a substring of the 'href' property in the response.

## Analysis
- The provided Swagger definition does not explicitly specify the structure of the 'return' object, so we cannot determine if 'return.owner.type' and 'return.owner.href' are present in the response.
- Additionally, the Swagger definition does not provide information about the 'return.owner' structure, so we cannot verify if the 'type' is a substring of 'href'.

## Conclusion
- Due to the lack of information in the Swagger definition, we cannot determine if the invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The POST request to "/users/{user_id}/playlists" allows creating a playlist.
- The response to this request includes the properties 'external_urls' and 'type'.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the 'type' property of the response should be a substring of the 'spotify' URL in the 'external_urls' property.

## Analysis
- The 'type' property is a string, and the 'spotify' URL in the 'external_urls' property is also a string.
- The invariant checks if the 'type' string is a substring of the 'spotify' URL string.
- However, the Swagger definition does not specify that the 'type' property should be a valid substring of the 'spotify' URL.

## Conclusion
- The invariant is a false-positive because it assumes a relationship between the 'type' property and the 'spotify' URL that is not specified in the Swagger definition.

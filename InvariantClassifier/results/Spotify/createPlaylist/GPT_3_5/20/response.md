## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition specifies a POST request to create a playlist for a user.
- The response schema includes a property 'tracks' with a sub-property 'limit' that represents the maximum number of items in the response.

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking if the 'limit' property in the 'tracks' object of the response is equal to 100.

## Analysis
- The swagger definition does not specify that the 'limit' property in the 'tracks' object should always be 100. It only describes the structure of the response, not the specific value of 'limit'.
- The invariant assumes a specific value for 'limit' without any indication in the swagger definition.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive because it assumes a specific value for 'limit' without any indication in the swagger definition.

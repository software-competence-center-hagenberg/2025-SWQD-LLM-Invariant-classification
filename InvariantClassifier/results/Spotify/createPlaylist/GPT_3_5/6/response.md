## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The POST request to "/users/{user_id}/playlists" is used to create a playlist.
- The response to this request contains two properties: "followers" and "tracks", each with a "total" property.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the total number of followers should be equal to the total number of tracks in the response.

## Analysis
The provided Swagger definition does not explicitly guarantee that the total number of followers will always be equal to the total number of tracks. The invariant assumes an equality relationship between these two properties, but there is no indication in the definition that this equality is always maintained.

## Conclusion
The invariant "return.followers.total == return.tracks.total" is a false-positive. It cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

The invariant LENGTH(return.tracks.href)==66 is false-positive. This is because the Swagger definition provided does not contain any information about a 'tracks' field in the response body. The 'href' field is directly under the 'properties' object, and there is no mention of 'tracks'. Therefore, the invariant is not applicable to the given Swagger definition.

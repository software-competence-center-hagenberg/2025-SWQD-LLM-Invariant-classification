## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/users/{user_id}/playlists" has a POST operation to create a playlist.
- The response to this operation includes a field called "external_urls" which is an object.

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking if the field "external_urls" in the response is not null.

## Analysis
- Based on the provided Swagger definition, the response schema includes the field "external_urls" which is an object. Since it is an object, it cannot be null, and the invariant return.owner.external_urls != null will always hold true for valid responses.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant return.owner.external_urls != null is a true-positive, as it will hold for every valid request on the API.

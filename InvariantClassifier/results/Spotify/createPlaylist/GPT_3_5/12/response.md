## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a POST request to create a playlist for a user on the Spotify API.
- The request body is expected to be an object.
- The response to this request is expected to be an object with a property 'images', which is an array of objects containing information about cover art for the album.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.images[] == []' checks if the 'images' array in the response is empty.

## Analysis
- The invariant 'return.images[] == []' is a false-positive.
- This is because the swagger definition does not specify that the 'images' array in the response should be empty.
- The 'images' array is described as containing cover art for the album, and there is no indication that it should be empty.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a POST request to create a playlist for a user.
- The response schema includes a property 'images' which is an array of objects containing image information.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.images != null' checks if the 'images' property in the response is not null.

## Analysis
- The invariant 'return.images != null' is a false-positive for this API.
- The 'images' property is an array, and even if it is empty, it will not be null.
- Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant 'return.images != null' is incorrect for this API as it does not hold for every valid request.

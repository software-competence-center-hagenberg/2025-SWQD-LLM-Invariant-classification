## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The POST request to "/users/{user_id}/playlists" creates a playlist.
- The response to this request contains an object with the properties 'external_urls' and 'id'.

## Invariant
The invariant states that the 'id' returned in the response is a substring of the 'spotify' URL in the 'external_urls'.

## Analysis
The provided Swagger definition does not explicitly specify the format or structure of the 'external_urls' property. Without knowing the exact structure of 'external_urls', it is not possible to guarantee that the 'id' is always a substring of the 'spotify' URL within 'external_urls'. Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive.

## Conclusion
Verdict: false-positive

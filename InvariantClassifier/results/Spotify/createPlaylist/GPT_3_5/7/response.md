The invariant is a false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant assumes the presence of both 'followers' and 'images' in the response, and that 'followers.total' and 'images' are directly related. However, the presence of 'followers' and 'images' in the response is not guaranteed, and they are not directly related in a way that would always satisfy the invariant. Therefore, the invariant is not correct for every valid request on the API.

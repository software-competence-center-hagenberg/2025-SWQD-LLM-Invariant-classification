The invariant is false-positive. The reason for this is that the invariant assumes a specific relationship between the 'followers.total' field and the size of the 'tracks.items' array, but the Swagger definition does not guarantee this relationship. The 'followers.total' field represents the total number of followers of the playlist, while the 'tracks.items' array contains information about the tracks in the playlist. There is no inherent connection between the number of followers and the number of tracks in a playlist, so the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

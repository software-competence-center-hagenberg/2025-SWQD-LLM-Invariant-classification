### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a playlist, which returns a response with two properties: `followers` and `images`. The `followers` property contains an object with a `total` integer representing the total number of followers, while the `images` property is an array of objects representing the cover art for the playlist.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the total number of followers (`return.followers.total`) is equal to the size of the images array (`size(return.images[])`).

### Analysis
1. **Nature of Data**: The `followers.total` represents the number of followers of the playlist, which is a separate concept from the images associated with the playlist. The number of followers is not inherently related to the number of images.
2. **Possible Values**: It is entirely possible for a playlist to have followers but no images (e.g., a newly created playlist that has not yet been assigned any cover art). Conversely, a playlist could have images but no followers (e.g., a public playlist that has not gained any followers yet).
3. **Logical Independence**: The two quantities (`followers.total` and `size(images)`) are logically independent. There is no requirement or guarantee in the API specification that these two values must be equal.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant `return.followers.total == size(return.images[])` does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

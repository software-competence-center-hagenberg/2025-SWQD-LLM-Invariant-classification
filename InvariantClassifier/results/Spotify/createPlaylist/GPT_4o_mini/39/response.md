### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint at `/users/{user_id}/playlists` that creates a playlist. The response for a successful creation (HTTP status 201) includes an object with two properties: `external_urls` (which contains a property `spotify` of type string) and `type` (also of type string). 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.type` is a substring of `return.external_urls.spotify`. This means that the value of the `type` field in the response should be contained within the value of the `spotify` URL string. 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Fields**: The `type` field is defined as a string that describes the object type, which in this case is expected to be 'playlist'. The `external_urls.spotify` field is expected to be a URL string pointing to the Spotify resource for the created playlist.
2. **Nature of the Data**: The `type` field will always be 'playlist' for this specific endpoint, while `external_urls.spotify` will contain a URL that typically looks like `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/{playlist_id}`. 
3. **Substring Relationship**: For the invariant to hold true, the string 'playlist' must be a substring of the URL returned in `external_urls.spotify`. However, URLs do not typically contain the word 'playlist' as a substring unless specifically designed to do so, which is not guaranteed in the API's response. 

### Conclusion
Since the `type` field is a fixed string ('playlist') and the `external_urls.spotify` field is a URL that does not necessarily include 'playlist' as a substring, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/users/{user_id}/playlists"
  post:
    description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
    parameters:
    requestBody:
        schema:
          type: object
    responses:
      '201':
        description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            owner:
              type: object


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: return.owner != null

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.NonZero
Invariant description: Represents long scalars that are non-zero. Prints as x != 0, or as x != null for pointer types.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.
Fields starting with "return" are fields in the response body.

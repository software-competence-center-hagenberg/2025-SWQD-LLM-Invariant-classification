### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a playlist for a user. The response for a successful creation (HTTP status 201) includes a schema that has a property `tracks`, which in turn has a property `limit`. The `limit` is defined as an integer, but there are no constraints or specific values mentioned in the schema that would restrict `limit` to a specific number like 100.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the `limit` field in the response will always equal 100: `return.tracks.limit == 100`.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that the `limit` field can only take on the value of 100. However, the Swagger definition does not provide any constraints or fixed values for the `limit` property. Since `limit` is defined as an integer, it can potentially take on a wide range of values, not just 100. Therefore, it is incorrect to assert that `return.tracks.limit` will always equal 100, as it could be any integer value depending on the implementation or the request parameters.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, it is classified as a false-positive.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a playlist for a user. The response for a successful creation (HTTP status 201) includes a schema that specifies an `images` property, which is an array of objects. Each object in this array can contain properties like `height`, `url`, and `width`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.images[] == []`, which implies that the `images` array in the response will always be empty after a successful playlist creation.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Response**: The response schema indicates that the `images` property is an array that can contain multiple objects. The description suggests that this array is meant to hold cover art for the playlist, which means it is expected to contain image data.
2. **Possibility of Non-empty Array**: Given that the purpose of the API is to create a playlist, it is reasonable to expect that the playlist may have associated images (cover art) upon creation. Therefore, it is entirely possible for the `images` array to contain one or more objects, depending on the input or the state of the playlist being created.
3. **Invariant Validity**: The invariant `return.images[] == []` suggests that the `images` array will always be empty, which contradicts the expected behavior of the API as described in the Swagger definition. The invariant does not account for scenarios where images may be provided or generated during the playlist creation process.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it incorrectly asserts that the `images` array will always be empty, while the API definition allows for the possibility of this array containing image objects upon successful playlist creation.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a playlist under the path `/users/{user_id}/playlists`. The response for a successful creation (HTTP status code 201) includes a schema that specifies a property `type`, which is a string and is described as representing the object type, specifically stating that it is 'playlist'. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that the response should always return `return.type == "playlist"`. This is a specific assertion about the value of the `type` property in the response object. 

### Analysis
Given the Swagger definition, the response schema indicates that the `type` property will be a string, and it explicitly describes that this string represents the object type as 'playlist'. Since the invariant is asserting that the `type` will always be 'playlist' for a successful creation of a playlist, it aligns with the description provided in the Swagger definition. 

However, it is essential to consider if there are any scenarios where this invariant might not hold. The invariant assumes that the API will only return a successful response with the `type` set to 'playlist' and does not account for potential error responses or variations in the API's behavior that could lead to different values for `type`. 

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant holds true for the successful creation of a playlist as described in the Swagger definition. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **true-positive** since it accurately reflects the expected behavior of the API for valid requests.

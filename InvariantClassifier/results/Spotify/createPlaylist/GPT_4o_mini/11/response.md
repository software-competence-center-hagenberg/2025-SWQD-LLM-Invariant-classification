### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a playlist, which returns a response with a schema that includes an `images` property. The `images` property is defined as an array of objects, each containing properties for `height`, `url`, and `width`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.images != null`, which implies that the `images` field in the response will never be null. 

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: According to the Swagger definition, the `images` property is an array. In JSON, an array can be empty but is still considered a valid array. Therefore, the `images` property can be an empty array (`[]`) or an array containing objects. 
2. **Nullability**: The invariant `return.images != null` suggests that the `images` property should not be null. However, the Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `images` cannot be null; it only defines it as an array. 
3. **Possible Scenarios**: If the API implementation allows for the `images` property to be omitted or explicitly set to null in certain error cases or conditions, then the invariant would not hold. For example, if a user creates a playlist without any images, the API might return a response where `images` is either an empty array or null, depending on the implementation.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes `images` will always be non-null, but the Swagger definition does not guarantee that `images` cannot be null, this invariant is not necessarily correct for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

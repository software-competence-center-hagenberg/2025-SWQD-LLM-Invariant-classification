### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a playlist for a user. The response for a successful creation (HTTP status 201) includes a schema that specifies a property `type`, which is a string indicating the object type, specifically mentioning it as 'playlist'. However, there is no mention of an `owner` field in the response schema.

### Invariant
The invariant states: `return.owner.type == "user"`. This implies that the response should contain an `owner` object with a `type` property that equals 'user'. 

### Analysis
Since the response schema only defines a `type` property for the playlist object and does not include any `owner` field, the invariant cannot be satisfied. The absence of the `owner` field in the response means that there is no way for the API to return an `owner.type`, making the invariant invalid. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant references a field that does not exist in the response schema, it cannot hold true for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a false-positive.

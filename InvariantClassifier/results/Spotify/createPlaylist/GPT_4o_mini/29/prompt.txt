Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/users/{user_id}/playlists"
  post:
    description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
    parameters:
    requestBody:
        schema:
          type: object
    responses:
      '201':
        description: [Create a Playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/create-playlist/)
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            type:
              type: string
              description: The object type: 'playlist'.


Is the following invariant a true-positive or a false-positive:
Invariant: LENGTH(return.owner.type)==4

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.string.FixedLengthString
Invariant description: Indicates that the value of a string variable always has a fixed length n. Represented as LENGTH(x)==n.
Fields starting with "input" are request parameters or fields in the request body.

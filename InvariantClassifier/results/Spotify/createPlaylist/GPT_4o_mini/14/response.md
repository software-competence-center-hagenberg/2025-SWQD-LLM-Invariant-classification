### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a playlist associated with a user. The response for a successful creation (HTTP status 201) includes a schema that contains an object with a property `external_urls`. This property is described as an object that holds known external URLs for the created playlist.

### Invariant
The invariant in question is `return.owner.external_urls != null`, which asserts that the `external_urls` field in the response will not be null.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The response schema indicates that `external_urls` is an object. However, the definition does not specify whether this object is guaranteed to be present or if it can be null. 
2. **API Behavior**: In REST APIs, it is common for certain fields to be optional or to have cases where they might not be populated. The invariant assumes that `external_urls` will always be present and non-null, which may not be the case based on the provided schema.
3. **Nullability**: Since the Swagger definition does not explicitly state that `external_urls` cannot be null, we cannot conclude that it will always have a value. There could be scenarios where a playlist is created without any associated external URLs, leading to `external_urls` being null.

### Conclusion
Given the lack of explicit guarantees in the Swagger definition regarding the presence and non-nullability of `external_urls`, the invariant `return.owner.external_urls != null` cannot be considered universally true for every valid request on the API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a playlist for a user. The response schema indicates that upon a successful creation (HTTP status 201), the response will include two properties: `href` and `id`. 

- `href`: A string that provides a link to the Web API endpoint for the created playlist.
- `id`: A string that represents the Spotify ID of the playlist.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.id` is a substring of `return.href`. This means that the value of the `id` field must appear somewhere within the value of the `href` field in the response.

### Analysis
In the context of the Spotify API, the `href` typically contains a URL that includes the `id` of the playlist. For example, a typical `href` might look like `https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/{user_id}/playlists/{id}`. In this case, the `id` would indeed be a substring of the `href`. However, this is not guaranteed for all possible implementations or changes in the API. The API could theoretically return an `href` that does not include the `id` as a substring, especially if the API design changes or if there are different formats for the `href` in different contexts.

### Conclusion
While it is likely that in many cases the `id` will be a substring of the `href`, it is not a guaranteed invariant across all valid responses from the API. Therefore, the invariant is not universally true for all valid requests and responses. 

Verdict: false-positive

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a playlist. The response for a successful creation (HTTP status 201) includes a JSON object with two properties: `href` and `type`. The `href` is a string that provides a link to the Web API endpoint for the created playlist, while `type` is a string indicating the object type, which is expected to be 'playlist'.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.type` is a substring of `return.href`. This means that the value of the `type` field in the response should appear somewhere within the `href` field.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Fields**: The `type` field is expected to have the value 'playlist' based on the description provided in the Swagger definition. The `href` field is a URL that points to the created playlist's details.
2. **Evaluating the Invariant**: For the invariant to hold true, the string 'playlist' must be a substring of the URL provided in `href`. However, URLs can vary widely in structure and content. While it is possible that some URLs might contain the word 'playlist', there is no guarantee that this will always be the case. For example, a URL might look like `https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/123456789` which contains 'playlist', but it could also be structured in a way that does not include the word 'playlist' at all, such as `https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/123456789/playlists`. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid response.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant requires a specific relationship between the `type` and `href` fields that is not guaranteed by the API's design, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. It does not hold for every valid request on the API.

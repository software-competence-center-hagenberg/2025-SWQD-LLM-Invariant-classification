### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a playlist. The response for a successful creation (HTTP status 201) includes an object with properties `external_urls` and `type`. The `external_urls` property contains a `spotify` field which is a string, and the `type` property is also a string indicating the object type.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.owner.type` is a substring of `return.owner.external_urls.spotify`. This implies that the value of `type` should be found within the value of `external_urls.spotify`.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The response structure does not include an `owner` field based on the provided Swagger definition. The properties mentioned are `external_urls` and `type`, but there is no indication that these are nested under an `owner` object.
2. **Logical Consistency**: Even if we assume there was an `owner` object, the `type` of the playlist (which is a string indicating 'playlist') is unlikely to be a substring of a URL (which is what `external_urls.spotify` would represent). URLs typically do not contain the type of the object in their string representation.
3. **Conclusion**: Given that the invariant references fields that do not exist in the response and that the logical relationship proposed (substring relationship between `type` and a URL) is not valid, the invariant cannot hold true for every valid request on the API.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it references non-existent fields in the response and proposes an invalid substring relationship between a type string and a URL.

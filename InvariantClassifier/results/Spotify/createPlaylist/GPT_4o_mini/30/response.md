### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a playlist. The response schema indicates that the response will include a property called `snapshot_id`, which is of type string. However, the definition does not specify any constraints on the length of this string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the length of `return.snapshot_id` is always equal to 56 characters: `LENGTH(return.snapshot_id)==56`. This is classified as a unary invariant indicating that the response will always return a string of fixed length 56.

### Analysis
Since the Swagger definition does not specify that `snapshot_id` must be of a fixed length, it is possible for the `snapshot_id` to be of varying lengths. The API could return different versions of the playlist with different `snapshot_id` values, and without explicit constraints in the definition, we cannot assume that it will always be 56 characters long. Therefore, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes a fixed length for `snapshot_id` without any supporting evidence from the Swagger definition, it is classified as a false-positive. The length of `snapshot_id` may vary, and thus the invariant does not hold for every valid request.

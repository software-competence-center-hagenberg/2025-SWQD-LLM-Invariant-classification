### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a playlist for a user. The response for a successful creation (HTTP status code 201) includes a schema that has a property `external_urls`, which is an object. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.external_urls != null`, indicating that the `external_urls` field in the response should not be null. 

### Analysis
In the context of the API, when a playlist is successfully created, it is expected that the `external_urls` field will be populated with relevant URLs. However, the invariant suggests that this field should never be null. While it is reasonable to expect that a successful creation would yield a non-null `external_urls`, there could be scenarios where the API might return a successful response but the `external_urls` could still be null (for example, if there are no external URLs available for the created playlist). 

Additionally, the invariant type indicates that it is checking for a non-zero scalar, which is not directly applicable to an object type like `external_urls`. This further complicates the validity of the invariant. 

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes `external_urls` will always be non-null regardless of the context, and considering the potential for it to be null in certain valid scenarios, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

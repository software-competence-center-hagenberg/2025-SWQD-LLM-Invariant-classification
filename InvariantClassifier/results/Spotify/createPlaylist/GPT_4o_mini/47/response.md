### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a POST endpoint for creating a playlist. The response for a successful creation (HTTP status 201) includes a JSON object with two properties: `type` and `uri`. 

- `type`: This is a string that indicates the object type, which is specified to be 'playlist'.
- `uri`: This is a string that represents the Spotify URI of the playlist.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.type` is a substring of `return.uri`. This means that the value of the `type` field (which is always 'playlist') should be found within the value of the `uri` field.

### Analysis
In the context of the Spotify API, the `uri` for a playlist typically follows a specific format, such as `spotify:playlist:<playlist_id>`. The `type` field will always be 'playlist'. However, the substring invariant would imply that the string 'playlist' must appear somewhere within the `uri`. 

Given that the `uri` format does not include the word 'playlist' as a substring (it contains identifiers and the prefix 'spotify:playlist:'), the invariant will not hold true for every valid response. For example, if the `uri` is `spotify:playlist:123456`, the substring 'playlist' does not appear in the `uri` itself, thus violating the invariant.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not hold for every valid response from the API, it is classified as a false-positive.

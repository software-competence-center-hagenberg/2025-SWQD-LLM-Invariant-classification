## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/businesses/search' is a GET request that retrieves businesses.
- The request parameter 'open_at' is of type integer and is not required.
- The response to this request includes a field 'total' of type integer.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the value of 'open_at' in the request should be greater than the value of 'total' in the response.

## Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive because there is no guarantee that the value of 'open_at' in the request will always be greater than the value of 'total' in the response. The absence of a required constraint on 'open_at' means that it can be omitted, and in such cases, the invariant would not hold. Additionally, the relationship between 'open_at' and 'total' is not specified in the API definition, so the invariant cannot be assumed to hold for every valid request.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive

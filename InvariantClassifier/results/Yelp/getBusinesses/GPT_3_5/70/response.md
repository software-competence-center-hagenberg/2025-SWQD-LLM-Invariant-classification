## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/businesses/search".
- It takes an optional query parameter "open_at" of type integer.
- The response schema includes an array of businesses, each with a location object containing a display_address array.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the value of the query parameter "open_at" should be greater than the size of the display_address array in the response.

## Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive because the size of the display_address array in the response is not directly related to the value of the "open_at" query parameter.
- The size of the display_address array depends on the specific businesses returned, while the "open_at" parameter seems to represent a time value.
- There is no direct correlation between the two, and the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive.

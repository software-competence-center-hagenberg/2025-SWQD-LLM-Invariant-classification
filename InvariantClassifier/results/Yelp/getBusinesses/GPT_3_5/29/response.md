## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is /businesses/search with a GET method
- The response schema includes a property 'businesses' which is an array of objects
- Each object in the 'businesses' array has a property 'location' which is an object
- The 'location' object has a property 'address1' of type string
- The 'location' object also has a property 'display_address' which is an array of strings

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking if the value of 'address1' is always a member of the 'display_address' array

## Analysis
- The invariant is checking a relationship between two fields within the 'location' object of each 'business' in the response
- However, based on the schema, there is no direct relationship specified between 'address1' and 'display_address'
- The 'address1' and 'display_address' are independent properties within the 'location' object
- There is no constraint or specification that enforces 'address1' to be a member of 'display_address'

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive. There is no guarantee that 'address1' will always be a member of 'display_address' for every valid request on the API.

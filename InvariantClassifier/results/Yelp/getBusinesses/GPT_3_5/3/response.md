## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition includes a GET endpoint for retrieving businesses. The response schema includes a field 'businesses' which is an array of objects. Each object in the 'businesses' array contains a field 'coordinates', which is an object with a field 'latitude' of type number.

## Invariant

The invariant is 'return.coordinates.latitude != 0', which checks if the latitude in the response is not equal to 0.

## Analysis

The invariant is checking if the latitude in the response is non-zero, which is a valid check for ensuring that the latitude is not at the equator (where latitude is 0). This check is relevant for ensuring that the returned coordinates are not at a specific location (latitude 0).

## Conclusion

The invariant 'return.coordinates.latitude != 0' is a true-positive, as it ensures that the latitude in the response is non-zero, which is a valid and meaningful check for the given API endpoint.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/businesses/search" has a GET method to retrieve businesses.
- The response schema includes a field "businesses" which is an array of objects.
- Each object in the "businesses" array has a field "location" which is an object with properties "address3" and "display_address".

## Invariant
- The invariant is checking if the value of "address3" in each "location" object is present in the "display_address" array.

## Analysis
- The invariant is checking a relationship between the "address3" and "display_address" fields within each "location" object in the "businesses" array.
- However, the provided Swagger definition does not specify any constraints or relationships between these fields.
- Without additional information or constraints in the Swagger definition, it is not guaranteed that the invariant holds for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive because it assumes a relationship between fields that is not explicitly defined in the Swagger definition.

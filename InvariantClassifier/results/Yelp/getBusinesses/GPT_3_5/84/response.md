### Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition includes a GET endpoint for retrieving businesses. The response schema includes a nested structure with the 'region' object containing a 'center' object, which in turn contains a 'longitude' property.

### Invariant

The invariant 'return.region.center.longitude != 0' specifies that the 'longitude' value in the response must be non-zero.

### Analysis

Based on the provided Swagger definition, the invariant is true-positive. The schema enforces the presence of the 'longitude' property within the 'center' object, and the invariant ensures that the value of 'longitude' is non-zero, which aligns with the schema definition.

### Conclusion

Verdict: true-positive

The invariant holds true for every valid request on the API, as the schema definition and the invariant align to enforce the non-zero value of 'longitude' in the response.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint '/businesses/search' is a GET request to retrieve businesses.
- The 'radius' parameter is optional and of type integer with a maximum length of 40000.
- The response schema includes an array of businesses, each with a 'location' object containing a 'display_address' array of strings.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the input radius should be greater than the size of the 'display_address' array in the response.

## Analysis
- The 'radius' parameter is optional, so it may not always be present in the request.
- The 'display_address' array in the response is nested within each business object.
- The invariant does not account for the possibility of the 'display_address' array being empty.
- If the 'radius' parameter is not provided, the invariant cannot be evaluated.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive. It does not hold for every valid request on the API.

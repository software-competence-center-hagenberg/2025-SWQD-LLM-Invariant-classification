## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint '/businesses/search' is a GET request to retrieve businesses.
- The response schema includes a 'businesses' array, where each item contains 'coordinates' and 'distance' properties.

## Invariant
The invariant is: return.coordinates.longitude < return.distance

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the longitude of the coordinates is less than the distance in the response. However, the schema definition provided does not include a direct 'return' object. Instead, it specifies 'businesses' as an array of objects, each containing 'coordinates' and 'distance' properties. Therefore, the invariant cannot be directly applied to the response schema as it is currently defined.

## Conclusion
The invariant is false-positive as it does not align with the structure of the response schema. It cannot be evaluated directly on the 'return' object as it is not explicitly defined in the schema.

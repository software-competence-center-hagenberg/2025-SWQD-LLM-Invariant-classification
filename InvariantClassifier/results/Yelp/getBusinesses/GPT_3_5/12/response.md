## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/businesses/search" is a GET request to retrieve businesses.
- The response schema includes a field "businesses" which is an array of objects.
- Each object in the "businesses" array has a field "location" which is an object.
- The "location" object has a field "display_address" which is an array of strings.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.location.display_address[]) >= 2

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the size of the "display_address" array in each "location" object within the "businesses" array is greater than or equal to 2.

## Conclusion
The invariant is true-positive. This is because the invariant ensures that every "location" object within the "businesses" array has at least 2 display addresses. Given the structure of the response schema, this invariant will hold for every valid request on the API.

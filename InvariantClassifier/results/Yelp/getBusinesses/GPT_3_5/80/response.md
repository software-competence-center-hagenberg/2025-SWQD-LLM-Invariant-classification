## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/businesses/search" is a GET request to retrieve businesses.
- The response schema includes a field "businesses" which is an array of objects.
- Each object in the "businesses" array has a "distance" field of type number and a "rating" field of type number.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the distance and rating of the businesses returned in the response should not be equal.

## Analysis
- The invariant is based on the assumption that the distance and rating of businesses should always be different.
- However, this assumption may not hold true in all cases. There could be businesses with the same distance and rating.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

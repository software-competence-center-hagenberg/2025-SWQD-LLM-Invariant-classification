## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/businesses/search" is a GET request to retrieve businesses.
- The request parameter "limit" is of type integer and is not required.
- The response contains a field "businesses" which is an array of objects.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the input parameter "limit" should be greater than or equal to the size of the array returned in the "businesses" field.

## Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive.
- The presence of the "limit" parameter in the request does not guarantee that the response will contain the same number of businesses as specified by the limit.
- The size of the returned array is dependent on the data available and may not always match the limit specified in the request.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive
- The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API as the size of the returned array is not directly controlled by the input limit parameter.

## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The API endpoint is a GET request to "/businesses/search" with a query parameter "open_at" of type integer.
- The response schema includes a field "businesses" which is an array of objects, each containing a field "review_count" of type integer.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the value of the query parameter "open_at" should be greater than the value of the field "review_count" in the response.

## Analysis
- The invariant is based on comparing the query parameter "open_at" with the field "review_count" in the response.
- However, the presence of the query parameter "open_at" is optional ("required: false") in the API definition, which means it may not always be present in the request.
- If the query parameter "open_at" is not provided in the request, the invariant cannot be evaluated, making it a false-positive.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive.

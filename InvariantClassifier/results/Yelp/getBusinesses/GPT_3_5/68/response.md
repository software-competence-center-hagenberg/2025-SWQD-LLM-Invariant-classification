## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "businesses/search" is a GET request that retrieves businesses.
- The request parameter "open_at" is of type integer and is not required.
- The response schema includes a field "businesses" which is an array of objects, each containing a field "categories" which is an array of objects.

## Invariant
- Invariant: input.open_at > size(return.categories[])
- This invariant checks if the value of the request parameter "open_at" is greater than the number of categories returned in the response.

## Analysis
- The invariant is false-positive.
- The reason is that the response schema does not directly provide a field for the size of the "categories" array. Therefore, the invariant cannot be evaluated based on the provided swagger definition.

## Conclusion
- Verdict: false-positive

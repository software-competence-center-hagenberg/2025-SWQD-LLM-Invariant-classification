This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

    summary: Get businesses
    description: Get businesses
    parameters:
      - name: radius
        in: query
        required: false
        type: integer
        maxLength: 40000
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Get businesses
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            businesses:
              type: array
              items:
                review_count:
                  type: integer

Invariant: input.radius > return.review_count

Invariant type: daikon.inv.binary.twoScalar.IntGreaterThan

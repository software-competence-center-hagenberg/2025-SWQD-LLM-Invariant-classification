## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition provides a GET endpoint for retrieving businesses.
- The response schema includes a field 'businesses' which is an array of objects.
- Each object in the 'businesses' array contains a field 'coordinates' which is of type object.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.coordinates != null' checks if the 'coordinates' field in the response is not null.

## Analysis
- The invariant is a non-null check for the 'coordinates' field in the response.
- Since the response schema defines 'coordinates' as an object, it will always be present in the response, and therefore 'return.coordinates != null' will always hold true for valid responses.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.coordinates != null' is a true-positive for the given REST API.

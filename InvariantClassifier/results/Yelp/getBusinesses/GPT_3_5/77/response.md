## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET request to "/businesses/search" endpoint, which takes an optional query parameter "open_at" of type integer.
- The response schema includes an array of businesses with various properties.

## Invariant
- The invariant states that the value of the query parameter "open_at" should be greater than the size of the array of businesses returned in the response.

## Analysis
- The invariant is based on the comparison between the input query parameter "open_at" and the size of the array of businesses in the response.
- However, the size of the array of businesses returned in the response is not directly related to the value of the query parameter "open_at".
- The size of the array of businesses depends on the search criteria and the available businesses, while the query parameter "open_at" seems to represent a time-related value.
- Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant is a false-positive.

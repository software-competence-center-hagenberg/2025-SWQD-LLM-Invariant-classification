## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition contains a 'GET' endpoint for '/businesses/search' with a response schema that includes a 'total' property of type integer.

## Invariant

The invariant 'return.total >= 0' specifies that the 'total' property in the response body must be greater than or equal to 0.

## Analysis

Given the response schema and the invariant, it is reasonable to assume that the 'total' property in the response body should indeed be greater than or equal to 0. This is because the 'total' property typically represents the count of businesses, and it should not be negative.

## Conclusion

Verdict: true-positive

The invariant 'return.total >= 0' is classified as true-positive because it aligns with the expected behavior of the API endpoint and the response schema.

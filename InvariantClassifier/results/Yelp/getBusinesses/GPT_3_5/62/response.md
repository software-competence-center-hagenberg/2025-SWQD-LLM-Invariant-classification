## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The swagger definition excerpt provided describes a GET endpoint for retrieving businesses. The response schema includes a field 'businesses' which is an array of objects, and each object has a field 'image_url' of type string.

## Invariant

The invariant states that return.image_url is Url, indicating that the value of the 'image_url' field in the response is always a URL.

## Analysis

Based on the provided swagger definition, there is no explicit constraint or validation that enforces the 'image_url' field to always be a URL. The schema only specifies the type of the field as a string, but it does not enforce the format to be a URL. Therefore, the invariant is a false-positive.

## Conclusion

Verdict: false-positive

The invariant 'return.image_url is Url' is a false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API, given the lack of explicit validation for the format of the 'image_url' field in the response.

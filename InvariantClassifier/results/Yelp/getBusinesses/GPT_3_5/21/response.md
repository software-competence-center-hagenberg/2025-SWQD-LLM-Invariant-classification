## Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving businesses. The response schema includes an array of businesses, each containing coordinates and distance properties.

## Invariant
The invariant states that return.coordinates.latitude should be less than return.distance for each business in the response.

## Analysis
The provided invariant is false-positive. This is because the response schema does not define a structure where coordinates and distance are directly related to each other. The coordinates and distance properties are at the same level within the 'businesses' array, and there is no direct relationship between them as required by the invariant.

## Conclusion
The invariant is false-positive as it does not hold for every valid request on the API.

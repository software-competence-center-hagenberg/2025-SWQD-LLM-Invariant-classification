## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/businesses/search" is a GET request to retrieve businesses.
- The response schema includes a field "businesses" which is an array of objects.
- Each object in the "businesses" array has a field "phone" of type string.

## Invariant
The invariant is checking if the field "phone" in the response is always numeric.

## Analysis
The provided Swagger definition does not enforce the format of the "phone" field in the response. Therefore, the invariant "return.phone is Numeric" cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request on the API. The response may include non-numeric values for the "phone" field, which would make this invariant a false-positive.

## Conclusion
The invariant "return.phone is Numeric" is a false-positive for the given REST API, as it does not hold for every valid request.

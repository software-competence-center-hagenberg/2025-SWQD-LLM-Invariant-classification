## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The endpoint "/businesses/search" has a GET operation to retrieve businesses.
- The response schema includes a field "businesses" which is an array of objects.
- Each object in the "businesses" array has a field "location" which is an object.
- The "location" object has a field "display_address" which is an array of strings.

## Invariant
The invariant is: size(return.location.display_address[]) >= 1

## Analysis
The invariant checks if the size of the "display_address" array in the response is greater than or equal to 1. This means that the invariant is checking if there is at least one display address for each business returned.

## Conclusion
Verdict: true-positive

The invariant is true-positive because it ensures that for every valid response from the API, there is at least one display address for each business. This holds true based on the response schema defined in the swagger definition.

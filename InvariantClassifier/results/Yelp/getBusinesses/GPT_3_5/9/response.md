## Swagger Definition Breakdown
- The swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving businesses.
- The response schema includes a field 'businesses' which is an array of objects.
- Each object in the 'businesses' array contains a field 'location' which is an object.

## Invariant
- The invariant 'return.location != null' checks if the 'location' field in each business object is not null.

## Analysis
- The invariant is true-positive because the response schema guarantees that the 'location' field exists in each business object, and it is of type object. Therefore, the invariant 'return.location != null' will hold for every valid response.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the invariant 'return.location != null' is classified as true-positive.

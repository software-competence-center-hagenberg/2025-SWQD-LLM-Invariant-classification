## Swagger Definition Breakdown

The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for retrieving businesses. The response schema includes a field 'businesses', which is an array of objects. Each object in the 'businesses' array contains a 'location' field, which is an object with a 'display_address' field that is an array of strings.

## Invariant

The invariant 'return.location.display_address != null' checks if the 'display_address' field within the 'location' object is not null in the response.

## Analysis

Based on the provided Swagger definition, the 'display_address' field is defined as an array of strings. Therefore, it cannot be null. The invariant 'return.location.display_address != null' is always true for valid responses according to the Swagger definition.

## Conclusion

The invariant 'return.location.display_address != null' is a true-positive, as it holds for every valid response on the API.

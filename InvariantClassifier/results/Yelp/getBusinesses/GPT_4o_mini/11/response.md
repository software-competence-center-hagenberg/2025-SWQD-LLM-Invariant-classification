### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at "/businesses/search" that returns a response with a schema containing a property called "businesses". This property is an array of objects, each of which has a property called "categories" that is also an array of objects with properties "alias" and "title".

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the array "return.categories[]" must be greater than or equal to 1, which means that every response must contain at least one category for each business.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Response Structure**: The response structure indicates that "businesses" is an array of business objects. Each business object can have a "categories" array.
2. **Possibility of Empty Categories**: The invariant assumes that every business will have at least one category. However, the Swagger definition does not specify that the "categories" array must contain at least one item. It is possible for a business to have an empty "categories" array, which would violate the invariant.
3. **Real-World Scenarios**: In practice, it is common for businesses to exist without any associated categories, especially in cases where the categorization is optional or not applicable.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant requires that every business must have at least one category, which is not guaranteed by the Swagger definition, the invariant is not correct for every valid request on the API. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

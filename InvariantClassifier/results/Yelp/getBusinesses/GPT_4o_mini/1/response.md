### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for searching businesses. The response schema indicates that the response will include an object with a property `businesses`, which is an array of objects. Each object in this array has a property `categories`, which is also an array of objects. The objects in the `categories` array have properties `alias` and `title`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the elements of the `categories` array in the response must not be null: `return.categories[] elements != null`. This means that every category object returned in the `categories` array must be a valid object and cannot be null.

### Analysis
The invariant claims that all elements in the `categories` array will be non-null. However, the Swagger definition does not explicitly state that the `categories` array cannot contain null values. It only defines the structure of the objects within the array. In REST APIs, it is common for arrays to contain null values, especially if the data source allows for such cases (e.g., if a business has no categories, the `categories` array could be empty or contain null entries). Therefore, without explicit constraints in the Swagger definition preventing null values, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold true for every valid request.

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition does not explicitly prohibit null values in the `categories` array, the invariant `return.categories[] elements != null` is not guaranteed to be true for every valid request. Thus, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

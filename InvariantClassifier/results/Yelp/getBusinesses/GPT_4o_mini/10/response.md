### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/businesses/search` that returns a response with a 200 status code. The response schema indicates that the response is an object containing a property `businesses`, which is an array of objects. Each object in this array has a `location` property, which is itself an object containing a `display_address` property. The `display_address` is defined as an array of strings.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.location.display_address != null`, which implies that the `display_address` property should not be null in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Response Structure**: According to the Swagger definition, `display_address` is an array of strings. In JSON, an array can be empty, but it cannot be null. Therefore, if `location` exists, `display_address` will always be an array (which can be empty but not null).

2. **Possible Scenarios**: The invariant checks for null specifically. Given the structure, if `location` is present, `display_address` will be an array (even if it is empty). However, if `location` does not exist, then `display_address` cannot be accessed, which could lead to a null reference in some programming contexts. But since the invariant is checking for the value of `display_address` itself, it will not be null if `location` exists.

3. **Conclusion on the Invariant**: The invariant `return.location.display_address != null` is technically correct in the context of the response structure defined in the Swagger. However, it does not account for the case where `location` might not be present at all, which could lead to a situation where `display_address` is not accessible. Therefore, while `display_address` itself cannot be null, the invariant's phrasing could lead to confusion regarding the existence of `location`.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a **false-positive** because it does not hold true in every valid request scenario. If `location` is absent, the invariant cannot be evaluated, leading to potential null reference issues in practical implementations.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/businesses/search` that accepts an optional query parameter `open_at` of type integer. The response is an object containing a property `businesses`, which is an array of business objects. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.open_at > size(return.businesses[])`, meaning that the value of the `open_at` parameter must be greater than the number of businesses returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Parameters and Response**: The `open_at` parameter is optional and can be any integer, including negative values or zero. The response can return an array of businesses, which can also be empty.
2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If `open_at` is set to a value greater than the number of businesses returned, the invariant holds true. 
   - If `open_at` is set to a value less than or equal to the number of businesses returned, the invariant does not hold. 
   - If no businesses are returned (i.e., the array is empty), the size of `return.businesses[]` is 0. In this case, `open_at` can be any integer, and the invariant would hold true if `open_at` is greater than 0.
3. **Counterexamples**: 
   - If `open_at` is set to 0 and the API returns 1 business, the invariant fails (0 is not greater than 1).
   - If `open_at` is set to 2 and the API returns 2 businesses, the invariant fails (2 is not greater than 2).

### Conclusion
The invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, as there are scenarios where `input.open_at` can be less than or equal to the size of `return.businesses[]`. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

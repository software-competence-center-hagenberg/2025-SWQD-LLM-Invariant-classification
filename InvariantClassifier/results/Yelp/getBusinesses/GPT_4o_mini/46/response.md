### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/businesses/search` that returns a response with a schema containing a property `businesses`, which is defined as an array of objects. The response is expected to return a 200 status code when successful.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.businesses != null`, which indicates that the `businesses` field in the response should not be null.

### Analysis
According to the Swagger definition, the `businesses` property is an array. In JSON, an array can be empty, but it cannot be null if it is defined as an array type. Therefore, the `businesses` field will always be an array (which can be empty) and will not be null. However, the invariant as stated is checking for null specifically, which is a valid check since the array itself cannot be null.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.businesses != null` is a true-positive because it correctly asserts that the `businesses` field will not be null based on the schema definition provided in the Swagger documentation. Therefore, it holds for every valid request on the API.

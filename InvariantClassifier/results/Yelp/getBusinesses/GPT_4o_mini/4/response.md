### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/businesses/search` that returns a response with a schema containing an array of businesses. Each business has a `coordinates` object, which includes a `longitude` property of type `number`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.coordinates.longitude != 0`, which means that the longitude value in the response should never be zero.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding Longitude**: Longitude values can be positive or negative, and they can indeed be zero. The value of zero longitude corresponds to the Prime Meridian, which is a valid geographical coordinate.
2. **Response Structure**: The invariant refers to the `longitude` property within the `coordinates` object of the businesses returned in the response. Since the Swagger definition does not impose any restrictions on the values of `longitude`, it is possible for the API to return a business with a longitude of zero.
3. **General Validity**: The invariant assumes that all returned longitude values must be non-zero, which is not a requirement stated in the Swagger definition. Therefore, there could be valid responses where `longitude` is indeed zero.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant `return.coordinates.longitude != 0` does not hold for every valid request on the API (as zero is a valid longitude), this invariant is classified as a false-positive.

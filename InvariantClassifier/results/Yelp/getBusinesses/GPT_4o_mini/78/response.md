### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/businesses/search` that returns a response with a structure containing a `businesses` array. Each item in this array has a `location` object, which in turn contains a `display_address` property. The `display_address` is defined as an array of strings.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `return.location.display_address[]` must be greater than or equal to 1. This means that every `location` object in the `businesses` array must have at least one entry in the `display_address` array.

### Analysis
The invariant implies that every business returned by the API must have a `location` with a non-empty `display_address` array. However, the Swagger definition does not specify that the `display_address` array must contain at least one item. It only defines the structure of the response but does not enforce any constraints on the contents of the `display_address` array. Therefore, it is possible for the `display_address` array to be empty, which would violate the invariant.

### Conclusion
Since the Swagger definition does not guarantee that the `display_address` array will always contain at least one item, the invariant is not correct for every valid request on the API. Thus, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

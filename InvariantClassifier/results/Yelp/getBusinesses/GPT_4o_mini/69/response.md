### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for searching businesses. It includes an optional query parameter `open_at` of type integer and a response schema that contains a list of businesses, each with a `transactions` array of strings.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.open_at > size(return.transactions[])`, which means that the value of the `open_at` parameter must be greater than the number of transactions returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Parameters and Response**: The `open_at` parameter is optional and can be any integer value (including negative values or zero). The `transactions` array can be empty or contain multiple strings.
2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If `open_at` is set to a value greater than the size of the `transactions` array, the invariant holds true.
   - If `open_at` is set to a value less than or equal to the size of the `transactions` array, the invariant does not hold. For example, if `open_at` is 0 and there are 0 transactions, the invariant fails (0 > 0 is false).
   - Additionally, if there are no transactions returned (an empty array), the invariant would only hold if `open_at` is greater than 0.
3. **Conclusion on Validity**: Since the `open_at` parameter can take on a range of values and the size of the `transactions` array can vary, there are valid requests where the invariant will not hold true. Therefore, the invariant is not universally applicable to all valid requests.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it does not hold for every valid request on the API. There are scenarios where `input.open_at` can be less than or equal to the size of `return.transactions[]`, violating the invariant.

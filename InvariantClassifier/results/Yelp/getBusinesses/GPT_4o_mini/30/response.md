### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/businesses/search` that returns a response with a schema containing an object with a property `businesses`, which is an array of objects. Each object in this array has a `location` property, which itself is an object containing an `address2` string and a `display_address` array of strings.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.location.address2` is always a member of `return.location.display_address[]`. This means that for every business returned in the response, the `address2` field must be present in the `display_address` array.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Structure**: The `location` object has two properties: `address2` (a string) and `display_address` (an array of strings). The invariant asserts that the string `address2` will always be found within the array `display_address`.
2. **Potential Scenarios**: In practice, the `display_address` array could contain various address components (like street name, city, state, etc.), and there is no guarantee that `address2` will be included in this array. For example, if `address2` is an apartment number, it may not be included in the `display_address` array, which could just contain the street address.
3. **API Behavior**: The API does not enforce that `address2` must be part of `display_address`. Therefore, it is possible for `address2` to exist without being included in `display_address`, making the invariant false.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant assumes a relationship between `address2` and `display_address` that is not guaranteed by the API definition, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. There are valid responses where `address2` is not included in `display_address`, violating the invariant.

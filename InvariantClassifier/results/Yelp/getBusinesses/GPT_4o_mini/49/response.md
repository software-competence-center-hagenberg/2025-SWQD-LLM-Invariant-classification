### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/businesses/search` that accepts an optional query parameter `radius`. The response for this endpoint includes a list of businesses, each represented as an object with various properties.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the input parameter `radius` must be greater than the size of the returned array of businesses: `input.radius > size(return.businesses[])`.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Invariant**: The invariant suggests that the radius specified in the request must always be greater than the number of businesses returned in the response.
2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If the `radius` is set to a small value (e.g., 1), it is possible that no businesses are found within that radius, resulting in an empty array (`size(return.businesses[]) = 0`). In this case, the invariant holds true since `1 > 0`.
   - If the `radius` is set to a value greater than the number of businesses returned (e.g., `radius = 5` and `size(return.businesses[]) = 3`), the invariant also holds true since `5 > 3`.
   - However, if the `radius` is set to a value less than or equal to the number of businesses returned (e.g., `radius = 3` and `size(return.businesses[]) = 3`), the invariant would not hold true since `3 > 3` is false.
3. **Conclusion**: The invariant does not hold for all valid requests because there are scenarios where the `radius` can be less than or equal to the number of businesses returned, violating the invariant.

### Conclusion
The invariant is a false-positive because it does not hold for every valid request on the API. There are valid cases where the radius can be less than or equal to the number of businesses returned, making the invariant incorrect.

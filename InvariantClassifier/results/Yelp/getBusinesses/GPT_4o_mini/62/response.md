### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/businesses/search` that returns a response with a 200 status code. The response schema indicates that the response body is an object containing a property `businesses`, which is an array of items. Each item in this array has a property `image_url`, which is defined as a string.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.image_url` is a URL, represented as `return.image_url is Url`. This means that every `image_url` in the response should always be a valid URL.

### Analysis
The invariant claims that the `image_url` field will always contain a valid URL. However, the Swagger definition does not enforce any validation on the format of the `image_url`. It only specifies that `image_url` is a string. Therefore, while it is possible for `image_url` to contain valid URLs, it is also possible for it to contain invalid strings that do not conform to URL standards (e.g., empty strings, malformed strings, etc.). Since the API does not guarantee that `image_url` will always be a valid URL, the invariant cannot be considered true for every valid request.

### Conclusion
Given that the Swagger definition does not enforce the `image_url` to be a valid URL, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**. It does not hold for every valid request on the API, as there is no guarantee that the `image_url` will always be a valid URL.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for searching businesses. It includes an optional query parameter `open_at` which is an integer. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `businesses`, which is an array of objects. Each object in this array has a property `categories`, which is also an array of objects.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.open_at > size(return.categories[])`, meaning that the value of `open_at` should be greater than the number of categories returned in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Parameters and Response**: The `open_at` parameter is optional and can be any integer (including negative values and zero). The `categories` array can be empty, meaning its size can be 0.
2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If `open_at` is set to 1, and the `categories` array is empty (size 0), the invariant would hold true (1 > 0).
   - If `open_at` is set to 0, and the `categories` array is empty (size 0), the invariant would not hold (0 is not greater than 0).
   - If `open_at` is set to 2, and the `categories` array has 1 item (size 1), the invariant would hold true (2 > 1).
   - If `open_at` is set to 1, and the `categories` array has 1 item (size 1), the invariant would not hold (1 is not greater than 1).
3. **Conclusion from Scenarios**: Since there are valid cases where `open_at` can be less than or equal to the size of `categories`, the invariant does not hold for every valid request. 

### Conclusion
The invariant `input.open_at > size(return.categories[])` is a false-positive because it does not hold true for all possible values of `open_at` and the varying sizes of the `categories` array in the response.

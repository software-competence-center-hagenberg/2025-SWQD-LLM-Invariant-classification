### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at "/businesses/search" which returns a response containing an object with a property called "businesses". This property is an array of objects, each containing a "location" object. The "location" object has a property "address3" (a string) and a property "display_address" (an array of strings).

### Invariant
The invariant states that "return.location.address3 in return.location.display_address[]". This means that the value of "address3" should always be found within the array of strings in "display_address" for each location object in the response.

### Analysis
1. **Structure of Response**: The response structure allows for the possibility that "address3" may not be included in the "display_address" array. The "display_address" array can contain any number of strings, and there is no requirement in the Swagger definition that mandates "address3" must be one of those strings.
2. **Variability of Address Components**: The "display_address" array is likely to contain various components of an address (like street name, city, state, etc.), and it is not guaranteed that "address3" will be included in this array. For example, if "address3" is a specific part of the address that is not commonly included in the display format, it may not appear in the "display_address" array at all.
3. **Lack of Constraints**: The invariant assumes a relationship between two fields that is not enforced by the API specification. Since the API does not specify that "address3" must be included in "display_address", the invariant cannot be considered universally true.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the invariant "return.location.address3 in return.location.display_address[]" does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, it is classified as a **false-positive**.

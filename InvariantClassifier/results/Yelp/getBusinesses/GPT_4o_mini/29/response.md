### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at "/businesses/search" which returns a response containing a list of businesses. Each business has a location object, which includes an address1 property (a string) and a display_address property (an array of strings).

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.location.address1` is always a member of `return.location.display_address[]`. This means that the value of `address1` should always be found within the array of strings represented by `display_address` for each business.

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Properties**: The `address1` property is a string that represents a specific address, while `display_address` is an array of strings that may contain multiple representations or components of the address.
2. **Potential Mismatch**: It is not guaranteed that `address1` will always be included in the `display_address` array. The `display_address` could contain variations of the address, abbreviations, or other related strings that do not include the exact value of `address1`. For example, if `address1` is "123 Main St", the `display_address` might include "123 Main Street" or just "Main St", which would not match the exact string.
3. **Variability of Address Formats**: Addresses can be formatted in various ways, and the API does not enforce that `address1` must be a member of `display_address`. Therefore, there could be valid responses where `address1` does not appear in `display_address`.

### Conclusion
Given the variability in how addresses can be represented and the lack of a guarantee that `address1` will always be included in `display_address`, the invariant is not correct. Thus, it is classified as a false-positive.

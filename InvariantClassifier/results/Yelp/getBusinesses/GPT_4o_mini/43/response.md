### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint `/businesses/search` that returns a response with a schema containing a single property `total`, which is defined as an integer. The response is expected to return a 200 status code when the request is successful.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.total >= 0`, which means that the `total` field in the response should always be greater than or equal to zero.

### Analysis
In the context of a business search API, the `total` field typically represents the number of businesses that match the search criteria. It is reasonable to expect that the total number of businesses cannot be negative; if no businesses match the search criteria, the total would logically be zero. Therefore, the invariant `return.total >= 0` aligns with the expected behavior of such an API.

### Conclusion
Given that the `total` field is an integer representing a count of items (businesses), it is correct to assert that this value should never be negative. Thus, the invariant holds true for every valid request on the API. 

Verdict: **true-positive**

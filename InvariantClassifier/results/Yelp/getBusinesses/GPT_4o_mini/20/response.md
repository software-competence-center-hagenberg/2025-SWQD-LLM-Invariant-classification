### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/businesses/search` that returns a response with a schema containing an array of businesses. Each business has a `coordinates` object with two properties: `latitude` and `longitude`, both of which are of type `number`.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.coordinates.latitude != return.coordinates.longitude`. This means that for every valid response from the API, the latitude and longitude of the coordinates should not be equal.

### Analysis
1. **Nature of Coordinates**: Latitude and longitude are geographical coordinates that can represent any point on the Earth's surface. It is entirely possible for a business to be located at a point where the latitude and longitude are equal, such as at the coordinates (0, 0) or any other point where the latitude equals the longitude.
2. **Valid Responses**: Since the API is designed to return businesses, there is no restriction in the definition that prevents a business from having coordinates where latitude equals longitude. Therefore, it is feasible for the API to return a response where `return.coordinates.latitude` is equal to `return.coordinates.longitude`.

### Conclusion
Given that there are valid geographical coordinates where latitude can equal longitude, the invariant `return.coordinates.latitude != return.coordinates.longitude` does not hold for every valid request on the API. Therefore, this invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

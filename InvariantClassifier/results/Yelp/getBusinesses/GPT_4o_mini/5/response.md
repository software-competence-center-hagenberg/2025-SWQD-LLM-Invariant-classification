### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at "/businesses/search" that returns a response with a 200 status code. The response schema indicates that it returns an object containing a property called "businesses", which is an array of items. Each item in this array has a property called "is_closed" of type boolean.

### Invariant
The invariant states that for the response, the property `return.is_closed` must be `false`. This means that all businesses returned in the response are open.

### Analysis
The invariant suggests that every business returned by the API will have the `is_closed` property set to `false`. However, the Swagger definition does not impose any restrictions on the values of `is_closed`. It is defined as a boolean, which means it can be either `true` or `false`. Therefore, it is entirely possible for the API to return businesses that are closed (i.e., where `is_closed` is `true`). Since the invariant asserts that `is_closed` must always be `false`, it does not hold for every valid response from this API.

### Conclusion
Given that the invariant does not hold for all valid responses (as businesses can be both open and closed), the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/businesses/search` that accepts an optional query parameter `open_at` of type integer. The response for a successful request (HTTP status 200) is an object containing a property `total`, which is also of type integer. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `input.open_at > return.total`, which means that the value of the `open_at` parameter in the request must be greater than the `total` value returned in the response. 

### Analysis
1. **Understanding the Parameters and Response**: The `open_at` parameter is optional and can be any integer, including negative values or zero. The `total` in the response is an integer that represents some count of businesses that match the search criteria. 
2. **Possible Scenarios**: 
   - If `open_at` is set to a value like 10, and the `total` returned is 5, then the invariant holds true (10 > 5).
   - However, if `open_at` is set to 0, and the `total` returned is 1, then the invariant does not hold (0 > 1 is false).
   - Additionally, if `open_at` is set to a negative value, say -1, and `total` is 0, the invariant also does not hold (-1 > 0 is false).
3. **Conclusion on Validity**: Since there are valid scenarios where `input.open_at` is not greater than `return.total`, the invariant cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request. 

### Conclusion
The invariant `input.open_at > return.total` is not universally true for all valid requests to the API, as demonstrated by the analysis of possible values for `open_at` and `total`. Therefore, it is classified as a false-positive.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/businesses/search` which accepts an optional query parameter `categories` of type array. The response for a successful request (HTTP status 200) is an object containing a property `businesses`, which is an array of objects. Each object in the `businesses` array contains a property `transactions`, which is also an array of strings.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the input array `categories` must be greater than or equal to the size of the output array `transactions`. In other words, it asserts that the number of categories provided in the request should be at least as many as the number of transactions returned in the response.

2. **Response Property**: The `transactions` array can also be empty or contain multiple items depending on the businesses found. There is no direct correlation established in the Swagger definition between the number of categories requested and the number of transactions returned.
3. **Counterexample**: If a request is made with `categories=[]` (size 0), it is possible for the response to return a business with a non-empty `transactions` array (e.g., `transactions: [

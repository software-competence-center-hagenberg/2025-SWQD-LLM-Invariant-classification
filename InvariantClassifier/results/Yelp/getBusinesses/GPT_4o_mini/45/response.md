### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/businesses/search` that returns a response with a structure containing a `region` object, which in turn contains a `center` object. The response is expected to be of type `object`, and the properties of this object are defined, but there is no explicit indication that `center` will always be present or non-null.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.region.center != null`, which implies that the `center` property of the `region` object in the response must not be null for every valid request.

### Analysis
The invariant assumes that the `center` object will always be present in the response. However, the Swagger definition does not specify that `center` is a required property or that it must always be populated. It is possible for the API to return a response where `region` exists, but `center` is null or not included at all, depending on the business logic or the state of the data.

### Conclusion
Since the invariant makes a claim about the presence of the `center` object without sufficient backing from the Swagger definition, it cannot be guaranteed to hold for every valid request. Therefore, the invariant is classified as a **false-positive**.

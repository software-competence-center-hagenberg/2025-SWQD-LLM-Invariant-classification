Is the following invariant for a REST endpoint "true-positive" or "false-positive"?

This is an excerpt of the swagger definition:

paths:
  "/businesses/search"
  get:
    summary: Get businesses
    description: Get businesses
    parameters:
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Get businesses
        schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            region:
              type: object
              properties:
                center:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    longitude:
                      type: number

Invariant: return.region.center.longitude != 0

Invariant type: daikon.inv.unary.scalar.NonZeroFloat
Invariant description: Represents double scalars that are non-zero. Prints as x != 0.

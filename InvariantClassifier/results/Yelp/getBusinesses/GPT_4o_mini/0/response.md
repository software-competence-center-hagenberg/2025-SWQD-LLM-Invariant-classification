### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/businesses/search` that returns a response with a schema containing an array of businesses. Each business has a `categories` property, which is also an array of objects. 

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.categories != null`, which implies that the `categories` field in the response should not be null. 

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: According to the Swagger definition, the `categories` property is defined as an array of objects. In JSON, an array can be empty but cannot be null if it is defined as an array type. Therefore, if the `categories` field is present in the response, it will either be an array (which can be empty) or it will not be included at all.
2. **Nullability**: The invariant checks for null specifically. Since the Swagger definition does not indicate that `categories` can be null (it is defined as an array), it is safe to assume that if `categories` is present, it will not be null. However, if there are no categories for a business, the `categories` field may simply be an empty array `[]` rather than null.
3. **Possible Scenarios**: If a business does not have any categories, the API could return an empty array for `categories`, which would mean `return.categories != null` would still hold true. However, if the `categories` field is omitted entirely from the response for a business, then the invariant would not hold as there would be no `categories` field to check against null.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.categories != null` is a **false-positive** because while the `categories` field is expected to be an array, it can be omitted from the response entirely, leading to a situation where the invariant does not hold. Therefore, the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API.

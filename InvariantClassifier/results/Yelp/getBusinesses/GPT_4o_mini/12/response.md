### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint for searching businesses. The response schema indicates that the response will contain an object with a property `businesses`, which is an array of business objects. Each business object has a `location` property, which is itself an object containing a `display_address` property. The `display_address` is defined as an array of strings.

### Invariant
The invariant states that the size of the `return.location.display_address[]` must be greater than or equal to 2. This means that every business returned in the response must have a `display_address` array with at least 2 elements.

### Analysis
The invariant assumes that every business will have a `display_address` array with at least 2 elements. However, the Swagger definition does not specify any constraints on the number of elements in the `display_address` array. It is possible for the `display_address` array to be empty or to contain only one element. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the invariant will hold for every valid response from the API. 

### Conclusion
Since the invariant does not hold for every valid request on the API, it is classified as a false-positive.

### Swagger Definition Breakdown
The provided Swagger definition describes a GET endpoint at `/businesses/search` that returns a response with a 200 status code. The response schema indicates that it returns an object containing an array of businesses. Each business in the array has properties `distance` and `rating`, both of which are defined as numbers.

### Invariant
The invariant states that `return.distance != return.rating`, which implies that for each business returned in the response, the distance should not be equal to the rating.

### Analysis
1. **Response Structure**: The response structure indicates that each business has both `distance` and `rating` properties. 
2. **Possible Values**: There is no restriction in the Swagger definition that prevents `distance` and `rating` from being equal. For example, a business could have a distance of 5.0 and a rating of 5.0, which would violate the invariant. 
3. **General Case**: Since both `distance` and `rating` are numeric values, there are scenarios where they can be equal. The invariant does not hold universally for all valid responses.

### Conclusion
The invariant `return.distance != return.rating` is a false-positive because it does not hold for every valid request on the API. There are valid cases where the distance and rating can be equal, thus violating the invariant.
